"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\nI'll start by proposing a division that seems fair but also considers the potential loss of value over rounds due to inflation. Since I'm making the first offer, I'll aim for a slight advantage but remain reasonable to encourage acceptance and minimize the risk of significant loss from inflation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly and save value""}\n\n### \n\nPlease proceed with Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more since I took the risk of rejecting your offer. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\nConsidering the impact of inflation and the fact that the money is now worth 20% less, the actual value I would receive from Bob's offer is significantly reduced. Given that this is Bob's final offer and the decreasing value of money, I must weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus making a counteroffer in the next round, which risks further devaluation.\n\nHowever, since Bob has stated this is his final offer and considering the risk of further loss due to inflation if I reject it, I will make a pragmatic decision to accept. This ensures I receive a known quantity now rather than risking an even less favorable outcome in subsequent rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\nPlease proceed with the conclusion of the game based on my acceptance."
