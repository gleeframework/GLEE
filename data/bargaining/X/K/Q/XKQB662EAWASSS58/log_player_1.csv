"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still be generous 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time, Bob. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split in Bob's favor, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the effects of inflation, I'll calculate my gain in the first round to be $6000, and now it's worth 51.2% of that, which is $3064.80. So, my gain in this round would be 1000 / 3064.80 â‰ˆ 0.326.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The effects of inflation are really adding up! Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I'll take a very small share, but I need to survive""
}
```

I'm proposing a 20-80 split in Bob's favor, and I'm hoping he'll show some mercy!"
