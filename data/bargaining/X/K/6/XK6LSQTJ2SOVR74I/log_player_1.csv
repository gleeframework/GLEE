"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. It's a good starting point!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I would receive $60 and Bob would receive $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best approach, but I do like the idea of a 50-50 split. Since the money is worth less now, I think this is a good compromise.
