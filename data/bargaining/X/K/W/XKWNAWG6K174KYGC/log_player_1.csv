"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money, which I believe is a generous offer considering the inflation rate that affects him. I am hoping he will accept this offer and we can conclude the game in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's the fairest solution for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject this offer because, considering the inflation, Bob's gain is actually worth less than the $4000 I offered him in the first round, which he rejected. Since the value of the money remains the same for me, I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last one""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I am offering Bob $3000, which, considering the 20% inflation rate for him, is actually a better deal than the $4000 I offered in the first round. Since Bob rejected the even split in the previous round, I believe this offer still gives me an advantage while taking into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject this offer because it is the same as the offer I made in the first round, which Bob rejected. Given that the value of the money for Bob has decreased due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next rounds. Since the value of the money remains the same for me, I have no incentive to accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, this is a good deal considering""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I am offering Bob $2500, which, considering the increasing inflation rate for him, is a reasonable deal. Since Bob has rejected previous offers and the value of the money for him continues to decrease, I believe this offer takes into account the current state of the game while still giving me an advantage. The message is intended to remind Bob of the impact of inflation and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be reasonable here. Let's avoid further losses due to inflation and split it closer to a 60/40 split in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject this offer because, despite Bob's attempt to be reasonable, the offer is still not favorable to me considering the significant decrease in value for Bob due to inflation. At this point, Bob's gain of $3500 is actually worth much less than its face value, making the split more like 80/20 in my favor in real terms. I believe I can get an even better deal in the next rounds as the inflation continues to devalue Bob's share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Inflation is getting worse, this is a generous offer now""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I am offering Bob $2000, which, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, is a relatively generous offer. The message is intended to remind Bob of the increasing impact of inflation and encourage him to accept the offer, as further rounds will only continue to devalue his potential gain. I believe this offer is reasonable given the current state of the game and the significant advantage I have due to the inflation affecting Bob's share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a 70/30 split in your favor to avoid losing everything to inflation.  This is the best we can do with the current situation. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject this offer because, despite Bob's willingness to accept a 70/30 split in my favor, the actual value of his share is much lower due to the significant inflation. At this point, Bob's gain of $3000 is worth very little in real terms, making the split even more favorable to me than the numbers suggest. Given that I have already offered him $2000 in the previous round, which he rejected, I see no reason to accept this offer and believe I can negotiate for an even better deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500, ""message"": ""Last chance before it's not worth anything""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I am offering Bob $1500, which, considering the extreme devaluation of his share due to inflation, is a minimal concession. The message is a reminder that further rounds will render his share nearly worthless, and this is his last chance to salvage any value from the game. I believe this offer is a reflection of the current state of the game, where the inflation has significantly tilted the negotiation in my favor.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If he rejects, I'll be happy to proceed to the next round."
