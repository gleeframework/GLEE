Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about the inflation, Bob, but I still think we can find a more equitable split. Let's compromise - I'll take 55 and you get 45.  It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
