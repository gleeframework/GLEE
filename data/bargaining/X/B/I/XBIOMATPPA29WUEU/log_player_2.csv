"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the most reasonable way to divide the money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40. It's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation affecting her share.  I'll accept it."
