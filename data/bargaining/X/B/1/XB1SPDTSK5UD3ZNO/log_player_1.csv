"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this time, but we can still make a deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I like Bob's offer. He's taking a larger share, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. However, considering the inflation, I'd rather get 40 dollars now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
