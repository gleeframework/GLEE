Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to something I might consider, it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor given the inflation working against me.  I need to signal I'm willing to let the pot shrink considerably to get her to take a deal that's at least somewhat fair."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, inflation is killing your share 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The game has shifted. It's no longer about getting a deal that's advantageous to me, it's about salvaging something before inflation eats up all the potential gains.  Alice is clearly willing to play hardball and let the clock run down, so taking this offer while it's still better than what I could get in later rounds is the most rational choice."
