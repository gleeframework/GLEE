"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While the offer is decent, it's worth holding out for a better deal.  There are 12 rounds, and the money is losing value each round, so we can try to push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it closer to 50/50.  This is a fair starting point. ""}
