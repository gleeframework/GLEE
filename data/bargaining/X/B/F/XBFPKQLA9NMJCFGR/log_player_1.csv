"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it still leaves Bob with a small amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer in the first round, as the inflation might make it less appealing to him in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, even with the 10% inflation. I will reject this offer and propose a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, aiming for a more equitable split while still securing a majority. The inflation is starting to affect my gains, so I need to be more competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, Bob's offer is better than anything I could reasonably expect to get in the next round. It's also better than my initial offer, so it makes sense to accept it."
