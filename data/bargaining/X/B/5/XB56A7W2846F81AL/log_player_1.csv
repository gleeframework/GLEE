I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, aiming for a large share.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, we'll see how the inflation affects our choices in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very generous, but I'm going to reject it.  It's clear that we both are playing a game of chicken here, and I think we can both do better.  The inflation is going to hurt us both, but I'm hoping to find a compromise that's more favorable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm reducing my demand, but still aiming for a larger share. I hope this offer is more appealing to Bob, as the inflation is starting to bite into both of our potential gains."
