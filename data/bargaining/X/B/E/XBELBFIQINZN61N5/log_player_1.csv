"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential earnings.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is now offering a 50-50 split, it's a more even split than my initial proposal. However, considering the inflation, I'm not sure if it's the best decision for me.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach this time, considering the inflation factor. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a smaller share this time. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm trying to take a bit more for myself, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm still holding out for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, especially since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation. However, I don't want to give up too much more.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise in future rounds.
