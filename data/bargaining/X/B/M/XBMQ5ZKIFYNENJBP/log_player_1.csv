Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 5200

This offer is still not good for me in the long run. I need to push for a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split. Take it before it's too late for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

This is a tough one, but I have to consider the rapidly decreasing value. While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
