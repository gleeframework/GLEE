I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share, knowing that with each round the money becomes less valuable.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to take something, I'm holding out for a better deal. The inflation is hitting Bob harder, and I know I can get a larger share if we continue."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my demand slightly due to the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. I believe Bob will be more willing to accept this offer, given the inflation affecting him more heavily."
