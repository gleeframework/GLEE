**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate as the value decreases rapidly for her. While her offer is closer to the middle, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the inflation working against her. I'll continue to apply pressure, aiming for a more favorable split."

# Alice's message: Still hoping for a better split

# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's getting risky now.  While not ideal, accepting guarantees a reasonable payout for me.  If I reject and continue to push for a better split, Alice might be willing to risk it all knowing that getting something is better than nothing as we approach the final rounds."
