"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain would be worth 95% of $8,000, which is $7,600.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think a 50/50 split is a bit too generous for me, given that I was already willing to offer him $2,000 in the first round. However, I'm willing to compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 5% inflation, my gain from round 1 would be worth $7,600. I'll take that into account when making my new offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a bigger share for taking the risk of proposing first.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation and the fact that we've both rejected each other's offers. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 14.26% inflation, my gain from round 1 would be worth $6,784.26 ($8,000 * 0.8526).

Considering Bob's new offer, I think a 60/40 split is a bit too generous for me, given that I was already willing to offer him $2,000 in the first round. However, I'm willing to compromise.

However, I notice that Bob is now offering a higher share for himself, and I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 14.26% inflation, my gain from round 1 would be worth $6,784.26.

Considering the previous offers, I'll try to find a balance. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think I deserve a slightly bigger share.""
}
```"
