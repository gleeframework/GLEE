"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got 60% in the first round, I'll offer you 30% this time. Accept or keep negotiating! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 in the second round is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Since I already had $600,000 in the first round, the total I'd have after two rounds would be $600,000 + 0.9 * $300,000 = $840,000.

I'd rather negotiate further to increase my share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further, I want a higher percentage this time.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my offer in this round will be worth 10% of what it was in the second round. In the second round, Bob had $700,000, which is 70% of the initial $1,000,000. So, in the third round, I'll offer 70% of the initial $1,000,000.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30%, but I think I deserve more after the first round!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'll give you a better deal. 55% is a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 in the fourth round is worth 73.9% of what it was in the first round. Since I already had $600,000 in the first round, the total I'd have after four rounds would be $600,000 + 0.939 * $450,000 = $828,150.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal here. 55% is a higher percentage than my previous offer, but it's still less than what I initially asked for. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if 55% is the best I can get. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my offer in this round will be worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round. In the first round, I offered $600,000, so in the fifth round, I'll offer 72.9% of that.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 438000,
  ""bob_gain"": 562000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 55%. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```"
