Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, Bob. This is a strong offer, and I'm not willing to concede much more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While time is running out, accepting a 40/60 split when we've been hovering around the 50/50 mark seems like a loss.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, so a firm rejection might push her closer to a more agreeable split in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We both know this needs to be close to even. I'm offering a slight advantage for me to end this now. Don't risk it!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose if this goes on much longer. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's time to be pragmatic. Alice is clearly unwilling to go near a 50/50 split.  While her offer isn't ideal, getting 45% is far better than the 0% we both get if we fail to reach an agreement."
