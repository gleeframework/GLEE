"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Bob should reject this offer. While it might seem fair on the surface, it gives Alice a significant advantage in the long run.  By rejecting, Bob gets a chance to propose a more favorable split for himself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can adjust later if we want."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my initial offer was fair. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob should reject this offer. While the money Alice receives is inflated, Bob receives very little and will suffer a further reduction in the next round due to inflation.  It's better to keep playing and see if he can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share than in the first round, but it's better than nothing, and we can continue to negotiate.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my initial offer was fair, and I'm willing to give up some to get a deal done. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob should reject this offer. Even though Alice is offering more than in the previous round, the inflation is making Bob's gain worth significantly less, and he has a chance to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share than in the previous round, but I need a better deal to make this worthwhile with the inflation. Let's try to find a compromise.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my initial offer was fair, and I'm willing to give up some to get a deal done. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob should reject this offer. While Alice is trying to be more compromising, the inflation is severely hurting Bob's gains. He still has a chance to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, even though there are fewer rounds remaining."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 8000,
""alice_gain"": 2000,
""message"": ""We're running out of time, and the inflation is hurting me badly.  I need a larger share to make this worth it. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my initial offer was fair. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us, or we'll both end up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Bob should accept this offer. While the inflation has severely reduced the value of Bob's share, accepting a 50/50 split is the best possible outcome at this point.  Rejecting and hoping for a better deal is risky, as there are only a few rounds remaining, and there's no guarantee Alice will be willing to give Bob more. Accepting the offer guarantees Bob receives something, while rejecting could result in both players getting nothing."
