Let's see how Alice reacts to a rejection. There's potential for a better deal for me, especially considering the faster rate of inflation working against me."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, and inflation is hitting us both. This is a reasonable compromise 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but time is running out and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, while continuing to gamble could leave me with nothing."
