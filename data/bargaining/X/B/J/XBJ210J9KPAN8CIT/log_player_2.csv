Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing significantly for me, I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting 43 now would be a terrible deal compared to even getting 50 in a couple of rounds. Alice knows time is on her side, but I need to show strength and hope she panics as the rounds dwindle."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be realistic. 50/50 is the fairest split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to appear more flexible while still aiming for a decent outcome. A 50/50 split seems fair and might be more appealing to Alice now that we're past the halfway point.  The ""take it or leave it"" adds a touch of urgency and finality, which might push her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 is not as fair as you think, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has taken a turn where Alice is using my inflation disadvantage against me.  While 44 is much lower than I wanted, rejecting this offer puts me in a very risky position. If Alice continues to offer only slightly increasing amounts, I'll be forced to accept even less in a later round due to the rapid inflation. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting now cuts my losses."
