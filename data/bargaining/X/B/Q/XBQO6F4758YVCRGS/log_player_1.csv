"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous offer, considering we're just starting out. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or decline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept it, since it's still a significant amount and I don't want to risk going to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
