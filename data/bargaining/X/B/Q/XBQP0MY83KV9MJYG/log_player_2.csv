Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We've both had our chances to negotiate, and the longer we wait, the less we both get.  A fair split is the best way to end this now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
