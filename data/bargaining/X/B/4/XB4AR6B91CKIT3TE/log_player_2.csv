Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think it's time we come to an agreement.  We're running out of time! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to something acceptable, time is on my side. The longer this goes on, the more desperate she'll become as the deadline approaches and my offers decrease in value.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! This offer is a good compromise. Let's seal the deal and avoid the risk of walking away with nothing.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I'm pushing for a better deal, I recognize that Alice is getting increasingly generous with her offers. I need to start making concessions to signal that I'm willing to negotiate, otherwise, she might dig in her heels.  This offer represents a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to move towards a compromise."
