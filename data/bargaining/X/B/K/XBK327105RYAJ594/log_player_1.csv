"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 7:3 split is fairer, considering you get to keep the same value while mine is diminishing each round. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
