"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you'll get a nice chunk to start with. We can negotiate later, but I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's worth remembering that Alice loses 10% of her value each round while I lose 0%. If I reject, I'll have the chance to propose a deal more favorable to myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle.  It's a fair starting point, and we can adjust later if needed.""
