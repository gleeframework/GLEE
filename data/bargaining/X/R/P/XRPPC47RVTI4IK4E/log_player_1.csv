"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't get away that easily, I'll take the majority! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad start for Bob, but I'm not giving up yet!

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the majority of the money, I'll keep pushing for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to get a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to get a decent amount."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200
