"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share, but leaves Bob with something, hoping he'll be more likely to accept rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best choice.  The inflation means any further rounds will reduce my potential gains, and there's no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything at all in later rounds."
