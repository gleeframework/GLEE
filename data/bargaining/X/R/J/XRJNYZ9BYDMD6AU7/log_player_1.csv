"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. I believe this is fair considering the value of money decreases with each round.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While the money is worth less each round, I believe this split is more equitable given I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
