Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take 90 dollars and leave 10 dollars for Bob. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, the inflation makes it less appealing to keep rejecting offers. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, especially considering the money I'd gain is worth less now."
