"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair in the first round, it's important to consider the inflation.  Rejecting and proposing in the next round will allow me to take advantage of the declining value of the money for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a fairer split, considering the inflation that affects my share more. This ensures both of us get a good amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share remains the same, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
The inflation is hurting me significantly, and I still believe I can get a better deal if I reject and propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""The inflation is hitting me hard. To make this worthwhile for both of us, I'm proposing a slightly larger share for myself, but still leaving you with a decent amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed affecting your share, but I've also made concessions. This is as fair as it gets. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice has acknowledged the inflation and is offering me a slightly higher share, I still believe I can secure a better deal for myself.  With each passing round, the value of the money I receive is significantly reduced.  I need to wait for a more advantageous proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""The inflation is becoming a major issue, and I need to secure a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  I believe this offer is still fair, considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I won't go below this. Inflation may be affecting you, but I'm not immune to walking away with nothing if we don't agree soon. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is severely affecting my share, and the value of the money I'm getting is rapidly declining. While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option to secure something before the inflation makes it completely worthless.  Alice's message also suggests she's not willing to budge further, making this a reasonable compromise."
