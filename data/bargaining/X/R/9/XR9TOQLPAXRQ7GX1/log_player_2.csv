Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, money's losing value, but I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the money is rapidly losing value, Alice is clearly holding out for a much larger share.  Accepting 40% now is a terrible deal compared to what I might be able to negotiate as the game goes on and the pressure increases on Alice. I need to push for a more equitable split while it's still worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. The money is losing value every round!  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to make a strong stand and offer a non-negotiable split. Alice is getting greedy, and the value of the money is plummeting. Offering a 50/50 split is fair and emphasizes the urgency of the situation.  Hopefully, this will make Alice realize we need to settle before we both lose out."
