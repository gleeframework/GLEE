"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nMy offer is 600,000 dollars for myself and 400,000 dollars for Bob. I've attached a message that says ""Let's be fair"" to convey a sense of reasonableness and cooperation, encouraging Bob to accept the offer. Since the money is worth 20% less to Bob with each passing round, I'm offering him a relatively generous share to incentivize him to accept early and avoid further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it seems fair on the surface, the inflation mechanic affects Bob's gain more significantly than mine. Since the money is worth 20% less to Bob in this round, his effective gain is actually 400,000 dollars (500,000 * 0.8), whereas my gain remains 500,000 dollars. I believe I can negotiate a better deal, considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is fairer""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob a slightly smaller share, considering the impact of inflation on his gain. Since the money is worth 20% less to Bob with each passing round, I believe this offer is more balanced, taking into account the decreasing value of his share. I've attached a message explaining my reasoning, hoping Bob will see the fairness in my proposal and accept it."
