"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to consider the proposal and negotiate further if he'd like."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less due to inflation, I now have a reduced amount to consider. However, I still need to think strategically about the division.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity. I'd like to see a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending a message to indicate that I'd like a more even split."

  ""alice_gain"": 450000,

}
```

I'm proposing a more even split, with me getting $450,000 and Bob getting $550,000. The message is a clear indication of my willingness to negotiate, but also a hint that I'm not willing to give up too much."
