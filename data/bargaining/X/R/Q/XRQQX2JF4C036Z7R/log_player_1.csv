"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

Round 2

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now equivalent to $7,600 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal.
