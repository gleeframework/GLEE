Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my initial offer.  I'm trying to get a large share, but I'm leaving a small amount for Bob in hopes he'll accept it.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting significantly less than my initial offer, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. This is a fair split considering the inflation effect, and I'm likely to get a worse deal if I reject and the game continues."
