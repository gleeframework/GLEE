"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 in a 3:1 ratio. I believe this is fair considering the potential inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering we both lose money with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
