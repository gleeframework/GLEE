"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'll get 6,000 and Bob will get 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, I'll get 5,000 and Bob will also get 5,000. This is a more balanced split than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to meet in the middle, I'll try to make an offer that's slightly more favorable to me. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is slightly more in my favor than the 50-50 split Bob suggested. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is the lowest I can go 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite aggressive now!

I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate since the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm going to make a last-ditch effort to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is the lowest I can go""}

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, which is still slightly in my favor but closer to Bob's original offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer and end the game!"
