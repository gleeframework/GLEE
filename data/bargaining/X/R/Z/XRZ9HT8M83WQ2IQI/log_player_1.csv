"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 600,000 dollars and leaving 400,000 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as keen on this offer as I was on the first one. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still keeping a larger share for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant reduction in the value of money, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Considering the inflation has affected my gain more severely than Bob's, I'll think carefully... 

I'll accept this offer.
