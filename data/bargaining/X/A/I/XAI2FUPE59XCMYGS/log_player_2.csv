"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a substantial sum. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} \n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this game, the goal is to maximize the gain while considering the impact of inflation on both players. Alice's initial offer gives her a significantly larger share, which might seem reasonable to her, but considering the inflation rates, I can potentially get a better deal in subsequent rounds. With each round, the value of money decreases more significantly for Alice than for me, which means she has more incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Therefore, rejecting the initial offer to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round is a strategic move."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make an offer that slightly adjusts the proportions in my favor, considering the pressure of inflation on both of us, but still aiming to be reasonable enough for Alice to consider.

{""bob_gain"": 420000,
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the shares slightly. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and it's more balanced given the money's decreasing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! This is a fair offer considering the inflation. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Even though Alice's offer has improved from the first round, the impact of inflation on both of our gains needs to be considered carefully. Given that the value of money decreases more rapidly for Alice, she is under more pressure to reach an agreement. This round's offer still doesn't seem to fully account for the disproportionate effect of inflation on our respective gains. Therefore, I will reject this offer, anticipating that Alice might be willing to concede more in the next round due to the increasing devaluation of her potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing pressure of inflation and the fact that Alice is losing more value with each passing round, I'll make an offer that reflects this dynamic. My offer will slightly increase my share, acknowledging the greater decrease in value for Alice, while still being mindful of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your potential gain, I believe this offer strikes a fair balance between our interests. Let's finalize the deal before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling the inflation pinch. This is my final offer. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: At this point, considering the significant decrease in value for both of us due to inflation, and acknowledging that Alice's potential gain is devaluing at a much faster rate than mine, her offer seems more reasonable. The difference in our gains is now more in my favor compared to previous rounds, reflecting the greater pressure inflation has put on Alice's side. Given the substantial loss of value for both parties and Alice indicating this is her final offer, it seems prudent to accept this deal rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
