"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting 800,000 and Bob getting 200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering the value of money may change in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll reevaluate Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll consider the effective values as follows:

My gain: 400,000 / 0.8 = 500,000 (in terms of purchasing power)
Bob's gain: 600,000 / 0.9 = 666,667 (in terms of purchasing power)

Considering the effective values, I think Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 55-45 split, let's see if we can find a middle ground.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""This split is more in line with the original 80-20, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, as I mentioned in my message to Bob in round 2."
