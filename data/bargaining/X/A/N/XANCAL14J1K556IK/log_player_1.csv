"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I get a slight majority, but it's still a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. Take 60% and I'll take 40% 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I want to give up 40% of the money. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob now, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70% this time, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 65% this time. It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground. I'll consider it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 65% offer. It's a decent compromise, and I'm willing to settle for it."
