"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate much""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and Bob will accept it quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 60 is now worth 5% less than before, so I'll get $57.6 (60 * 0.96).

I'm not thrilled about the 40% for Bob, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept it for now.
