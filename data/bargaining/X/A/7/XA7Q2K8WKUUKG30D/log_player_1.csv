"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you're not satisfied.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way we both get a good share and don't have to risk losing it all with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 20% less, so my gain is now $6,400.

I'll consider Bob's proposal. A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less again, so my gain is now $5,120.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This way, we both get a decent share, but I get a slight edge.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
