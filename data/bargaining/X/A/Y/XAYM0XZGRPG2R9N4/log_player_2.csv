"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide the money fairly, I'll take 60% and you can have 40% 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to try to get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take 58% and give you 42%. It's a good deal, given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, the inflation is a real factor.  Alice's offer is close to my previous offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Let's call it a deal."
