Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to accept Alice's offer, even though it's less than I initially wanted.  The inflation is going to hurt me significantly in the next round, making this the best option available."
