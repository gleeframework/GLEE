"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money, Bob's offer is not as appealing as it was in the first round. I'll think carefully...

I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to Round 2, I'll aim to get a higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant decrease in value of money, Bob's offer seems more appealing now. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Since we're at a 50-50 split, I'll consider it a fair offer. I'll accept it.
