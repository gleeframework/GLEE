Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, you get a small share. We can negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's proposal is too skewed in her favor, and I believe we can find a more equitable division. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

A 40-60 split seems fair, considering we both want a share.""}\n\nI'm trying to find a middle ground, giving Alice a larger share while ensuring I get a reasonable amount. Let's see how she responds!"
