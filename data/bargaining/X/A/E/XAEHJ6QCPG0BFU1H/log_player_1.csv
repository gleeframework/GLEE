"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 3:2 ratio, with me receiving $60 and you receiving $40. This way, we can still have a decent split while giving me a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
