"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money now. You'll get $100,000 and I'll get $900,000.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is an invitation to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This is a more even split, and we can get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the new values are:

* Alice's gain: 450,000 (from 900,000)
* Bob's gain: 495,000 (from 550,000)

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to try to get a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, so the values are:

* Alice's gain: 360,000 (from 450,000)
* Bob's gain: 396,000 (from 495,000)

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you more, but I need to keep a significant amount to make this worthwhile.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $600,000 and keeping $400,000 for myself."
