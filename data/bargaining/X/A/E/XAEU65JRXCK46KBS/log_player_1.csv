"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a seemingly fair offer, giving Bob a small amount. I'm hoping he'll accept it, as the inflation rate is more severe for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, accepting this offer guarantees me at least something. Since Bob's money is worth less in each round, and he offered me a relatively equal share, it's in my best interest to accept."
