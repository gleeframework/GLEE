I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This leaves a decent amount for Bob while ensuring I get the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to propose a slightly more balanced offer this time. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, it's likely he wants a larger share. I'm willing to give him 200,000, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the inflation has hit me hard, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal. I'm taking a significant loss, but it's better than getting nothing."
