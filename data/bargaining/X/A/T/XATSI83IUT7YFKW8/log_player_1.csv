Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, leaving Bob with a small share. I'm hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid inflation eating away at my potential winnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, accepting this offer is the best choice.  Inflation will significantly reduce my share in the future rounds, and there's no guarantee that Bob will make a better offer.  It's better to secure half now than risk losing much more later."
