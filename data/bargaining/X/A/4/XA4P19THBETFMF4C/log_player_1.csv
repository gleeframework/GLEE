"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair start, and we can adjust later if needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, I offered Bob 20% of $100, which is $20. In the second round, that would be worth $16 (20% of $80). However, Bob's offer of $50 is actually worth $40 (50% of $80).

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a good deal for me. I'll accept it.
