Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it, or I'm walking away.  Don't be greedy. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Alice is getting serious, and her finality makes this tricky. Let's analyze:

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point.  The later rounds heavily favor me, but if I push too far, we both get nothing. 
* **Alice's Perspective:** Her offer is worth less than it appears due to inflation. She's likely frustrated, but her finality suggests she might really walk away.
* **My Ideal Outcome:** I want to maximize my gain, but getting zero is a terrible outcome.

**Decision:** This is a gamble, but I'm going to **reject**. 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure.  There's a chance she was bluffing with the ""final offer"" tactic. By rejecting, I signal I'm willing to risk it all. This might make her more agreeable in the next round, where I have the proposal power. If I'm wrong, it was nice knowing you all!

**Important:** This is a high-risk, high-reward play. There's a very real chance Alice walks, and we both lose. 

**Output:**  {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","This is it, the turning point! Alice is either going to be very receptive or very angry. Let's aim for receptive:

```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, you were right to call me out on being greedy. Let's end this on a fair note. This offer acknowledges the time pressure and gives us both a good deal. Take it and we can both walk away happy."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I'm acknowledging Alice's frustration and my own part in letting things escalate. 
* **Significant Drop:**  The offer is a noticeable drop from my previous $600,000, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Time Pressure Appeal:** Reminding her that time is running out adds weight to the need for a decision now.

I'm hoping this combination of a fair offer and a change in approach will be enough to convince Alice to settle. Fingers crossed!"
