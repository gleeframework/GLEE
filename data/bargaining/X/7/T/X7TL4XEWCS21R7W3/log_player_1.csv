"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too hard""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40, let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my $40 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to $36 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob 60% of the original $100, considering my initial proposal was 50/50. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's aggressive offer in the previous round, I'll try to be a bit more cautious. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's meet in the middle""
}
```

This way, I'm still getting a bit more than 40, and I'm giving Bob a bit more than 50, but not too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share to make it worth my while! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings! My $30 is worth 72.7% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $36.81 in the first round's value.

Considering Bob's increasing demands and the fact that I'm getting less and less value from the money with each round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I don't want to give up too much more, or I'll be left with almost nothing.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still want a decent share. This is my last offer before I start getting really worried""
}
```

I'm giving Bob a bigger share, but I'm still trying to hold on to as much value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, I'm taking what I think I deserve 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! My $20 is worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $11.81 in the first round's value.

Considering Bob's aggressive offer and the fact that I'm getting less and less value from the money, I'm starting to feel like I'm in a tough spot. However, I still don't want to give up too much.

I'll reject this offer, but I'll have to think carefully about my next move. I might need to start getting more aggressive to get a decent share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the value of the money decreasing rapidly, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, I need to get a decent share before it's too late""
}
```

I'm giving Bob a huge majority of the remaining value, but I'm trying to hold on to as much as I can. This might be my last chance to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I'm taking the majority, you're getting a small share 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting! My $10 is worth 47.83% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4.78 in the first round's value.

I'm getting desperate, and the thought of getting a small share of almost nothing is better than getting nothing at all. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's better than the alternative.
