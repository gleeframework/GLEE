Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Inflation will continue to erode the value of the money in subsequent rounds.  It's better to take what I can get now."
