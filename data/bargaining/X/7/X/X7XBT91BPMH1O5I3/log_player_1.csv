"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not giving up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the $200,000 I'd get is actually worth $160,000 in real terms, which is a significant decrease from the original $500,000. Given Bob's message, it seems he's trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and my $200,000 offer would be worth $160,000 in real terms. I'll try to make a new offer that's more attractive to Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This way, we can both get a decent amount of money, even with inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, giving Bob a larger share in the hopes that he'll accept this offer and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up much more, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the 48.8% decrease, the $100,000 I'd get is worth only $51,200 in real terms.

Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to make a final offer, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating into my potential earnings! With the 48.8% decrease, my offer from Round 3 would be worth $160,000 in real terms. I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, Bob, but I need to get something for my efforts. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 25/75 split, giving Bob a larger share in the hopes that he'll accept this offer and we can move forward."
