I propose taking $900,000 for myself and giving Bob $100,000. This ensures a good starting point with a fair initial offer, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
``` 

I propose taking $810,000 for myself and giving Bob $190,000. This is a more aggressive offer than the first round, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my initial proposal. It still leaves him with a significant portion of the money, while ensuring I get a larger share."
