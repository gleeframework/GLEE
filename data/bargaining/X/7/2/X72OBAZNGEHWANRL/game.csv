9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. It's a good deal for both of us!,Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"You took 90% last round, now it's my turn to take a larger share. This is a fair compromise.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I understand you want a bigger share this time, but 60/40 seems more fair. We can both get a decent amount, and this avoids further rounds where the money might become worth less.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I'm not willing to settle for 30% this time. I'll take a slightly smaller share now to have a bigger share later, when the money is worth less.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Let's end this now.  I'm willing to give you a larger share than last time, and we can both get a decent amount.  Continuing will only hurt both of us due to inflation.",Alice,5,
