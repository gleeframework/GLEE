"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority, you get a smaller share. Let's see what you think! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's fair to start with a larger share for the proposer, I think I can get a better deal over the next few rounds.  Let's see what I can get."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is better for both of us in the long run. Let's start with this and see how it goes.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit. This split feels more even to me, what do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. This is a decent compromise, and I'd rather secure this amount than potentially lose more due to inflation."
