"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 700000 for me and 300000 for you. Let's split it this way. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 300,000 is a decent amount, it's worth negotiating for a better split, especially since the money is going to be worth less in the next round due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'll be the one taking the risk of rejection in the next round. Let's be fair and move towards a resolution.""}
