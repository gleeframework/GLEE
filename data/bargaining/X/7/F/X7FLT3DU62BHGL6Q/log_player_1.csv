"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. My message is a straightforward one, trying to convey that I'm being generous but also assertive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve a bit more than you're offering. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the $6,000 I'd gain in this round is actually worth 80% of the $8,000 I would have gained in the first round, and the $4,000 Bob would gain is worth 90% of the $4,400 he would have gained in the first round.

Given this, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than mine was in the first round. I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
