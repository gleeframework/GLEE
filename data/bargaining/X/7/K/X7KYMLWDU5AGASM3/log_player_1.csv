"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's see what Bob thinks!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split, a fair and balanced start! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or not. On one hand, it's a 50/50 split, which seems fair. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I should settle for half of the initial amount.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now and see what Bob comes up with next.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but still a decent offer!""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if it sticks! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

At first glance, it seems like Bob is still trying to get the better end of the deal, but I suppose it's a slightly more generous offer than before. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

After some thought, I've decided to accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with even less.
