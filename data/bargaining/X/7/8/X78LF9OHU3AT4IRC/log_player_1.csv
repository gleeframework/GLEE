"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so we can consider this a generous offer. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer to split the money evenly might seem fair at first glance, I have to consider the inflation factor. Since the money has lost 20% of its value in the second round, accepting this offer would mean I'd get significantly less than what I initially offered Bob in the first round. I think I can negotiate for a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share than in the previous round, while still trying to appear reasonable. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to make Bob feel like we're compromising and finding a mutually beneficial solution. Since the money has lost 20% of its value twice, I'm actually offering Bob less than what he would have gotten if he had accepted my initial offer, but I'm hoping he won't realize that."
