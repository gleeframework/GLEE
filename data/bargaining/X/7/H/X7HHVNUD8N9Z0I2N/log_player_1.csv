"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a split that gives me 80% of the original $10,000 and Bob 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split. It's a more balanced approach, and we can both benefit from starting with a fair division. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4500 in this round is equivalent to $3600 in the previous round, which is a 20% decrease.

I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. I think I can do better than a 45% share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $3600 in the previous round is worth 20% less than the $4500 I would have gotten in the previous round, so my gain in this round is worth 80% of $3600, which is $2880. However, I'll make an offer that takes into account the original value of the money.

I'll propose a split that gives me a higher share, considering the original value of the money.
