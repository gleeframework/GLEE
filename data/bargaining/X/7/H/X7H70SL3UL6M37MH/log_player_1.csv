"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a fair share, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'm taking a bit more this round, but I'll consider your next proposal if you accept this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my $600,000 is now worth 90% of that, which is $540,000. I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'd like to take a larger share to compensate for the inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal share."
