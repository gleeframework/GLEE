Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to pressure me into accepting a bad deal. While the money is decreasing in value, accepting 25% of the pot is a terrible outcome for me. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair share, even if it means going down to the wire."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm accepting your original offer to end this before the money is worthless. Don't get greedy!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is plummeting rapidly. While I'm holding out for a better deal, continuing to play chicken with Alice could be disastrous. Accepting her original offer, even though it favors her, is better than risking an even lower payout in later rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a reasonable, though not ideal, amount."
