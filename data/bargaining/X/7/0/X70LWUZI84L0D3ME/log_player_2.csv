"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 60% to her and 40% to me, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll need to adjust my calculation. Since the money is worth 36% less, my gain of 450,000 in the previous round is equivalent to 450,000 / 0.64 = 703,125 in the current round.

Alice's current offer is 480,000, which is less than my adjusted equivalent gain. I'll accept this offer to avoid further rounds and the increased inflation.
