"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse.  Let's be practical - a 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the inflation working against me.  I'm eager to reach a deal, but I need it to be equitable. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
