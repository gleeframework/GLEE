"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and inviting Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more for being the one who makes the next offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more for making the next offer, huh?

I'll reject this offer. I think 4000 is a bit too low for me, considering the inflation factor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob made the previous offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more for making the next offer, so I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more skewed split in Bob's favor, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share this round, but I'm still not sure it's fair 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a balance between giving me a slightly bigger share and keeping a decent amount for himself.

I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to take it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
