While this is a very bad deal for Bob, it's better than getting nothing. At this point, Bob's share is shrinking rapidly with each round due to inflation, and it's unlikely he'll be able to get a better deal. Accepting this offer at least secures some money for Bob, even if it's significantly less than what he initially hoped for."
