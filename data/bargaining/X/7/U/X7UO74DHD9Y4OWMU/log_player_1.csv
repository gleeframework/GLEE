"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a good starting point, Alice. However, I think a 55/45 split is more reflective of the fact that the value of the money decreases for both of us over time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
