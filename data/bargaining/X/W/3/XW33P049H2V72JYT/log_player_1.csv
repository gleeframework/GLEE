"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping to secure a quick win. I'll see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, and even though my potential gains are now worth 5% less, I believe I can do better by holding out for another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

Since Bob rejected my first offer and then offered a significantly worse deal, I'll slightly adjust my proposal. This time, I'll offer 850,000 to myself and 150,000 to Bob. This should be more appealing to him, while still giving me a large share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than his previous offer, it's still not a good deal for me. Inflation has already taken a big bite out of the potential gains, and I think I can do better by holding out for a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer slightly, but I still want a significant share. Hopefully, Bob will start to see that we're getting closer to the end and he'll want to settle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but not by much.  Inflation is taking a toll, but I'm still confident I can get a good deal.  I think Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but the inflation has significantly reduced the value of his offer. I'm still holding out for a better deal. With only a few rounds left, the pressure is on both of us, and I believe I can still get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure. I need to find a balance between getting a decent share and avoiding a situation where we both get nothing. This offer is still significantly in my favor, but I hope it will be enough to entice Bob to accept before the inflation makes it even less appealing for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of his offer. I'm still holding out for a better deal.  We are down to the wire, and I believe I can get a larger share."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm lowering my offer slightly to try and incentivize Bob to accept. I'm aware of the significant inflation, but I'm still confident in my ability to secure a good share of the money. I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to finally agree, as both of us stand to lose a lot if we reach the final round and end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the final round. While Bob's offer is not ideal due to the inflation, it is better than getting nothing. With the current inflation, I will gain 36.88% less than my initial proposal, but it is better than zero. Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer."
