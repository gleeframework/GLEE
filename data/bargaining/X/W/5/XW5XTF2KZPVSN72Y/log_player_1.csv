"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% of the money, is that fair?""
}
```

This offer is a relatively generous one, considering the game's rules. I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a bit more than the 37.5% he would get if we simply split the money evenly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 50/50, it's a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less after the second round of inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% of the money, a fair compromise?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the money, which is a bit more than my initial offer, but still a reasonable split considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly more generous offer, but still a good deal for me! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is not generous at all! He's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get more money, but I'm not having it. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less after the fourth round of inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept this time."
