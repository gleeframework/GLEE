"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect me more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer in round 1. While he acknowledges the inflation, his proposed split heavily favors him.  It's better to negotiate further and aim for a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer isn't fair considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle with this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Inflation:** Bob is right that the inflation impacts him more. 
* **Seeking Compromise:** Instead of sticking to the initial 60/40 split, I'm moving slightly towards Bob's desired split to incentivize a deal. 
* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, the value of the money decreases. It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly."
