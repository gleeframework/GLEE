"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 55 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant drop in value due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Since Bob's offer is still 55-45, I'll make a slight adjustment to try to get a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that's slightly more aggressive:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
