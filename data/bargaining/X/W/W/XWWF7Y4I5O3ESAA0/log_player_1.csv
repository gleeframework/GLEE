"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a split of 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob. This ensures that we both get a significant share and leaves room for negotiation in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 850,000, increasing Bob's to 150,000. This is a compromise to avoid further losses from inflation.  I believe this is a fair offer that leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
While Bob's offer is significantly higher than his previous ones, it's still far lower than what I believe I can get in later rounds. By rejecting this offer, I can continue to leverage the impact of inflation on Bob's gains, hopefully leading to a more favorable outcome for me."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, but still a substantial amount for both of us.  I believe this offer reflects the growing impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains, and offers a path toward a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer, while higher than his previous ones, still doesn't reflect the significant impact of inflation on his share. I believe I can secure a better deal in the remaining rounds by continuing to reject his offers."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm further lowering my share to 750,000, increasing Bob's to 250,000.  With each round, the value of the money for Bob decreases. I believe this offer is a fair compromise considering the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is the highest yet, the inflation is significantly impacting his share. I believe I can secure a better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing to leverage the impact of inflation in the remaining rounds."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share slightly to 700,000, while increasing Bob's to 300,000.  This offer reflects the ongoing impact of inflation on Bob's gains and provides him with a more substantial share than his previous offers.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the limited time remaining to reach an agreement."
