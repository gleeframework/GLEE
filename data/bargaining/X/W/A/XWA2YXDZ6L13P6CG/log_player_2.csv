Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5300, 
""alice_gain"": 4700, 
""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth helps no one.  I'm willing to be slightly flexible, but this is a fair deal considering the inflation working against me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is correct that the value is decreasing, but she's not being reasonable, she's taking advantage. It's unlikely she'll offer more than $4,300 in the next round given her current trajectory.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even with the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, 
""alice_gain"": 5000, 
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. I'm offering a perfectly even split.  Take it before inflation eats away at any chance of a decent agreement for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm still being generous 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is eating into the potential gains significantly now. Accepting $4,400 is better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing as we get closer to the deadline. Alice is unlikely to offer more than this, given her previous offers."
