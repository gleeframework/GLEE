"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better, let's switch roles and see what you propose. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is mirroring my previous offer, but I'll have to adjust for the inflation.

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll propose a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I think I can do better. I'll propose a new offer: 550000 for me and 450000 for you. The money is worth less now, so I'll take a slightly smaller share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the current value, and keeping $550,000 for myself, which is 55% of the current value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money has been further reduced by 20% due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Take this offer and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $510,000, which is 51% of the current value, and keeping $490,000 for myself, which is 49% of the current value."
