"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple 60/40 split.  It's a good deal for both of us to avoid the money shrinking. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. How about a 55/45 split?  It's closer to the middle ground and still a good amount before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share.  It's a fair offer, and we can avoid further losses from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's stop wasting time.  I'm willing to go down to a 52.5/47.5 split. Take it or leave it - every round is costing us serious money. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share,  it's better to accept this offer and secure something rather than risk getting nothing. We've lost a significant amount due to inflation, and further rounds might leave us with even less."
