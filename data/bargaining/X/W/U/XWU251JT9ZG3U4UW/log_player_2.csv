Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is fair and avoids us both losing out due to inflation. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently trying to take a larger share, knowing that the inflation hurts me more than it does her. While this offer is tempting because the gap is closing, I believe I can still get a better deal in the next few rounds. It's getting risky, but holding firm for a slightly better offer is worth the gamble at this stage."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's close this deal now and both benefit.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm giving you one last chance. This is practically a 50/50 split considering inflation. Don't be greedy, let's finish this. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now very close to a 50/50 split considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains.  The risk of getting nothing in the remaining rounds is too high to justify holding out for a slightly better deal.  It's time to accept and secure a reasonable share."
