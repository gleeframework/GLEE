"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, my $8,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $6,400. Bob's $2,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $1,800.

Considering the new values, Bob's offer of $5,000 for both of us is a good deal for me, as it's more than half of the current value of my original $6,400.

I accept the offer.
