"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 3/4, but it's a generous offer 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $600,000 is now worth $480,000. Bob's offer is a significant reduction in my share.

I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my goal is to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take 85% 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. My $600,000 is now worth only $312,000, and my offer in the previous round would be worth even less now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 15% of the remaining money, but I need to think about the opportunity cost of rejecting it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive with my offer, considering the rapid inflation. My goal is to get a larger share while there's still some value left.

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the decrease.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair split, before it's too late!""
}
```"
