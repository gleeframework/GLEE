"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly aggressive offer. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a small share to get the money now, but I want to secure most of it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not going to accept this offer. While Bob is offering me $10, it's worth only $8 after the 20% inflation. I'd rather take the risk of getting a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly bigger share this time, hoping that the prospect of getting something now will sway him. I'm also mindful of the inflation, but I believe this offer gives me a decent chance of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but even with the inflation, $20 is better than nothing. If I reject this, the next round will see my share worth less than $10. It's time to take the money and run."
