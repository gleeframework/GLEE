Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. It accounts for the fact that we're both losing value over time, but still gives you a good share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
