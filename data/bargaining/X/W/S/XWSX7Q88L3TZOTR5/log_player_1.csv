"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take 55% of the money ($550,000) and leave 45% ($450,000) for Bob, with a message suggesting a fair split. This opening offer is a common strategy to leave room for negotiation while also trying to set the tone for what Alice considers a reasonable division. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer or make a counteroffer that is not drastically different."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself this round. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer is closer to a 50-50 split than her initial proposal, she might believe that accepting this offer would be giving in too quickly and that she can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Additionally, the fact that the money is worth 10% less to her in this round than in the first round might motivate her to try to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. She may also be considering the psychological aspect of the game, trying not to show weakness and hoping that Bob might be more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\nIn this round, Alice proposes a division that is closer to the middle ground, considering the previous offers. She suggests taking $520,000 for herself and leaving $480,000 for Bob. Her message, ""Let's meet closer to the middle,"" indicates her willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. This approach aims to persuade Bob that she is flexible and willing to listen to his concerns, potentially increasing the chances of reaching an agreement in this round. By giving in slightly more than in her initial offer but not going as low as Bob's previous offer, Alice is trying to maintain a strong negotiating position while showing signs of compromise."
