"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly biased split, but still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll re-evaluate the offer.

Alice's gain of $300,000 is worth 0.95 * $600,000 = $570,000 (5% less than the original $600,000).
Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 0.9 * $400,000 = $360,000 (10% less than the original $400,000).

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as I'd rather have more than $570,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on a slightly more even split. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000, which is 58% of the original amount, and keeping $420,000 for myself, which is 42% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to an even split, but I still want a slight edge. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll re-evaluate the offer.

Alice's gain of $400,000 is worth 0.859 (1 - 0.141) * $600,000 = $514,400 (14.26% less than the original $600,000).
Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 0.729 (1 - 0.271) * $400,000 = $288,600 (27.1% less than the original $400,000).

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively even split and I'd rather have $514,400 than risk going to another round with further reduced values."
