Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Think about the inflation, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is already costing us both. Accept this and let's be done with it.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, Bob. Take this offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are severely hurting Bob's potential gains. While ideally, he'd want a larger share, accepting Alice's offer now is better than risking even further losses in future rounds."
