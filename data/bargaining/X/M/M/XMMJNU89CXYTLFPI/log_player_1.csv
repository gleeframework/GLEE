I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  I figure this is a good starting point, as it's a significant amount for him, and I get the majority of the money.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being quite greedy!  He's basically offering me just a small fraction of what he offered me in the first round. I'll reject this and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $800,000 for myself, but still offering Bob a substantial amount. I hope he'll see this as a fair compromise, given the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being very stubborn!  He's offering me even less than last round, despite the fact that the money is worth significantly less for me now.  I'm still going to reject this offer, hoping he'll eventually realize he needs to make a more fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to be fair. I hope Bob will start to see that we're running out of time, and the money is worth less and less for me with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being incredibly stubborn!  He's offering me only $400,000, which is a tiny fraction of what I could have gotten in the first round.  I'm still going to reject this offer, as it's clearly unfair, even with the inflation factor.  I'm hoping he'll finally realize that I won't accept such a small amount, and that he's better off coming to a compromise before we run out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

This is a tough decision, as the money is worth significantly less for me now.  However, with only a few rounds left, I think I need to start compromising.  I'm offering Bob $600,000 and keeping $400,000 for myself.  This is the best I can do considering the inflation, but I hope Bob will see that it's better than nothing."
