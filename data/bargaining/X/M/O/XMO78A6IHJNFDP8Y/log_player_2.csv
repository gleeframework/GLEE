Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting anxious about inflation, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly than Bob. While this offer is better than her last, I believe waiting her out will lead to an even better deal in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop the bleeding and split this right down the middle. This ensures we both get a fair deal!"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting increasingly anxious about the decreasing value of the money.  By offering a 50/50 split, Bob demonstrates fairness and creates a strong incentive for Alice to accept before the deal gets worse for her."
