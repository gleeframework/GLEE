Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. The inflation hits me harder, so I need a slightly larger share to make it worthwhile.  This offer is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
