"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, seems fair to me""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and offer Bob 4,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5,000$ is now worth 9,000$ and Bob's gain of 5,000$ is now worth 6,250$. Considering the inflation, the 50/50 split is actually more favorable to me. I'll accept this offer.
