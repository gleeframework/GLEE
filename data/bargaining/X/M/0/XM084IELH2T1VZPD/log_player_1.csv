"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which is a 60-40 split. My message to Bob is that we can start with a fair split and then negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split, but it's a good starting point. Let's see if we can improve it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $50 is actually worth $40 in the first round's money. 

I'll decide to reject this offer since I can do better than a 50/50 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $60 in the first round is now worth $48 (60 * 0.8). I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to keep some for myself.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm willing to compromise. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less in the fourth round, my gain of $60 in the first round is now worth $31.28 (60 * 0.488). 

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate my actual gain in the fourth round: $45 is worth $45, which is more than my adjusted gain of $31.28. I'll decide to accept this offer.
