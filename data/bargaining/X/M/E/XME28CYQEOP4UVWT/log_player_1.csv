Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty standard offer. I want to secure a large portion of the money, but I'm also trying to be fair enough that Bob might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is drastically in his favor, I'm still going to reject it.  The inflation is affecting my gains significantly, but 5 dollars is not worth risking losing more in the next round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering him a larger share than my initial offer. This takes into account the inflation and the fact that he's likely to be more willing to negotiate after his last offer was rejected."
