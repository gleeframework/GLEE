"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll have a chance to even things out later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early to accept such an uneven split.  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair starting point.  We can negotiate further if you'd like.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can find a better balance.  Let's keep talking. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, this offer still feels uneven, and I'm hoping to get a bigger share with the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly.  It's the fairest solution, and we both get a decent amount.""}
