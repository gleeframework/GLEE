I propose a 51/49 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, it seems we both need to be more flexible to reach an agreement.  A 50/50 split is a fair and equitable solution, and it gives us both a chance to get something before inflation further reduces the value of the money."
