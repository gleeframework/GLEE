"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice rejected my offer, it's my turn now. Here's my offer for Round 2:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 3, the money is worth 19% less, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly. Since Alice's offer is still a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair offer, I'll accept it this time.
