"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I think we can work together well from here! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that!  I'm willing to split it 60/40 in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 50/50 and end this game! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even with the inflation, 50/50 is a good deal and it's better to be sure of something than risk getting nothing."
