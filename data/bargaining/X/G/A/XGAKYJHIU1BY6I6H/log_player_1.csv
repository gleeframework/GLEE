"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original $100. I'll take $80, which is 80% of the original $100. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a better share too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $70 is equivalent to $63 in the original terms. Bob's gain of $30 is equivalent to $27 in the original terms.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a better share too, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Let's calculate the equivalent values in the original terms: my gain of $60 is worth $43.20, and Bob's gain of $40 is worth $27.20.

Considering the significant drop in value, I'm not thrilled with this offer. However, I don't want to reject it outright, as I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. I'll take a cautious approach and accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
