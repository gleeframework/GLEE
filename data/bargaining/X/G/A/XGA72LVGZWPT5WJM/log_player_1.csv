I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping to secure a good portion of the money before inflation kicks in too hard.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation.  It's better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds!"
