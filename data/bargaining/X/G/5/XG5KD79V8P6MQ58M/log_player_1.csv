"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation effect on my share. However, I'm not thrilled about the 5% reduction in Bob's share.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 45 for me and 55 for him, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm proposing that I get 52% of the total $100 and Bob gets 48%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting! Bob's offer is now a 50-50 split, which is a significant change from his previous offers. Considering the inflation effect on Bob's share, I think this offer is a good compromise.

Since my share remains the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation effect on my end. I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for Round 4:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
