"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

This offer suggests that I, Alice, will take $60 and Bob will take $40. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair and equal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the inflation you'll experience. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factored in, my $40 gain in this round is actually worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split in Bob's favor, especially since he's not experiencing any inflation. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45 is a more reasonable split for me""
}
```

This offer takes into account the ongoing inflation, and I'm proposing a slightly lower amount for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
