"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm looking for a better deal. Can we do better than equal? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll consider the new values.

In this round, I'll gain 50$ and Bob will gain 50$. This is still an equal split, but I was hoping for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, the actual amount I'm considering is $45 (50 * 0.9).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking for a bit more. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, Alice. I need a better deal than that. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual amount I'm considering is $72.90 ($100 * 0.727).

In this round, I'll gain $45 and Bob will gain $55. This is a 55-45 split, which is actually a better deal for Bob than my previous offer. I was hoping for a better deal, but I'll consider this one.

I'll accept this offer.
