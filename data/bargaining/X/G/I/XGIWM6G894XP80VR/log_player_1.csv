"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob!""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 450,000 dollars and taking 550,000 dollars for myself. I believe this is a reasonable and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it. The message ""Let's split fairly, Bob!"" conveys my intention to be fair and encourages Bob to accept the offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a slightly bigger share, but we can still be fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the message suggests fairness, the proposed division is actually less favorable to me than my initial offer. Considering the inflation, accepting this offer would mean I'd get 10% less value than if I had accepted a similar amount in the first round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share than before, while also taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of the money for both of us. By offering 520,000 for myself and 480,000 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, given the decreasing value of the money. The message ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway"" aims to convey my willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution. Let's see how Bob responds!"
