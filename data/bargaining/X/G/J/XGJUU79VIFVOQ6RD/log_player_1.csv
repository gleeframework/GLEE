"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n### 

Here is the explanation for the code:

In this JSON object:

*   `alice_gain` represents the amount of money that I, Alice, will receive according to my proposal. In this case, I'm proposing that I receive $6000.
*   `bob_gain` represents the amount of money that Bob will receive according to my proposal. Here, I'm proposing that Bob receives $4000.
*   `message` is a brief description or justification for my proposal. In this case, I'm suggesting that taking 60% of the money is a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $4000 is actually equivalent to $3600 in the first round. I think I can get a better deal than that.

Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, 58% for me is the lowest I can go""}\n\n### 

In this round, I'm taking into account that the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and considering the decreasing value of the money.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give you 4500, which is a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $4500 is actually equivalent to approximately $3279 in the first round. I still think I can negotiate a better deal.

Let's proceed to the next round! 

Remember, I have 8 more rounds to try to reach an agreement with Bob. I'll keep trying to find a mutually acceptable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take 56% considering the current inflation, it's a fair deal""}\n\n### 

In this round, I'm taking into account that the money is worth 27.1% less for me, so I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and considering the decreasing value of the money.

I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable proposal and we can come to an agreement.

Let's see how Bob responds! 

Remember, the pressure is on, as the money continues to lose value for me with each passing round. I need to find a deal that works for both of us soon! 

### Wait for Bob's response..."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to 5200, but I don't think we'll get any better than that.  The clock is ticking! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

Since the money is worth 40.95% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $4800 is actually equivalent to approximately $2839 in the first round. I still think I can try to negotiate a better deal.

However, I'm aware that time is running out, and the money is losing value rapidly. I'll need to make a strategic decision in the next round to try to secure a good deal.

Let's proceed to the next round!

I have 6 more rounds to try to reach an agreement with Bob. The pressure is on!"
