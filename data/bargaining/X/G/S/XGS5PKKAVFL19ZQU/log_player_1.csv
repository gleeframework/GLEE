"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nSince I'm Alice, I'll start by proposing a division where I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this division is fair, but I'm open to negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money is worth less for you in the next round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I'm Alice, I need to consider the impact of inflation on my potential gain. In this round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. Considering this, I'll evaluate Bob's offer carefully.\n\nBob has offered me $45, which, due to inflation, is effectively worth $40.50 (90% of $45). Bob will receive $55, which is not affected by inflation. Given this, I don't think the offer is fair, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Therefore, I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make a new proposal for dividing the $100, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob seems willing to negotiate. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous. Let's settle this!""}\n\nIn this round, I'll take into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less for me than in the first round, and 20% less than the initial value. Given this, I'll try to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. I'll propose a division where I receive $57 and Bob receives $43, along with a message suggesting that this is a generous offer considering the inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
