"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer. I figure Bob will likely want to accept this, as it's a significant amount of money. However, I want to ensure I get a large portion of the money to avoid too much loss due to inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is a significant amount of money, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split this time, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. While the inflation has hit my side harder, I'm still aiming for a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With inflation hitting my gains so hard, I need to accept this offer.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's getting risky to keep turning him down. I'm still getting a good amount of money."
