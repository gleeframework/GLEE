"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's move on to the next round if you disagree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially considering the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'd like to make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a 50/50 split. We can split the difference and still get a decent amount of money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise given the decreasing value of the money."
