"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close this deal!""}\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I'll make the first offer. I propose that I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. The message I'm sending to Bob is: ""Let's be fair and close this deal!""\n\nI'm starting with a fairly even split, slightly favoring myself, but still leaving room for negotiation. The message aims to convey a sense of fairness and a desire to conclude the deal quickly, which might appeal to Bob and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to close the deal quickly, but my offer is more in line with the long-term value. Think carefully about the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer gives me $4,000, which is significantly less than my initial proposal. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round, hoping to get a more favorable offer.\n\nAdditionally, I take into account Bob's message, which mentions the long-term value and inflation. While it's true that the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm not convinced that his offer is the best I can get. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. I propose that I receive $4,800 and Bob receives $5,200. The message I'm sending to Bob is: ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle.""\n\nI've adjusted my offer to be more favorable to Bob, while still trying to get a relatively fair share. By mentioning inflation, I'm acknowledging the decreasing value of the money and showing that I'm willing to adapt. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer.\n\nLet me know how Bob responds!"
