"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll calculate the effective amount I'll gain:

700,000 / 0.8 = 875,000

This is a significant amount, but I can do better. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.
