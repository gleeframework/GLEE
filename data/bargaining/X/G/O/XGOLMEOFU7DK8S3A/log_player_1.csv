"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is a generous share considering we're just starting out. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  I think that's the best way to ensure we both get a good amount.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll calculate the actual value of the amounts:

* My gain: 500,000 * 0.8 = 400,000
* Bob's gain: 500,000 (no change)

I'll reject the offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. My message to Bob:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it evenly is the best idea, Bob. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a better share, considering the inflation factor."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than our last offers.  This is a fair compromise, and we'll both come out ahead.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the amounts:

* My gain: 550,000 * 0.516 (48.8% of the original 1,000,000) = 283,800
* Bob's gain: 450,000 (no change)

I'll reject the offer because the value of my share is still not satisfactory, considering the inflation. My message to Bob:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced this is the best compromise, Bob. I'd like to try to do better.""

I'm pushing for a larger share, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the amounts:

* My gain: 600,000 * 0.332 (67.23% of the original 1,000,000) = 199,200
* Bob's gain: 400,000 (no change)

I'll reject the offer because the value of my share is still too low, considering the inflation. My message to Bob:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with inflation eating away at our potential gains, we need to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair share.  This offer takes the inflation into account and allows us both to walk away with something.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the amounts:

* My gain: 650,000 * 0.205 (79.03% of the original 1,000,000) = 133,250

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the amounts:

* My gain: 700,000 * 0.132 (86.58% of the original 1,000,000) = 92,560
* Bob's gain: 300,000 (no change)

I'll reject the offer because the value of my share is still too low, considering the inflation. My message to Bob:

# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the amounts:
