"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob. This will hopefully make him think I'm fair, and he might accept. But if he doesn't, I'll be in control of the next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal, the value of my gains has decreased significantly due to inflation. Accepting this offer means I'll get a smaller share, but it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
