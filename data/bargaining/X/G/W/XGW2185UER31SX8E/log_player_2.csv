Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value faster than me, I think I should take advantage of that 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using increasingly aggressive tactics to pressure me into accepting a bad deal. While I am losing value faster, accepting a 40/60 split at this stage would be a significant loss. It's better to counter-propose and hold out for a better offer, aiming for something closer to even or at least a smaller gap."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. It accounts for the inflation but is still beneficial for you. Let's be practical and end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, time is running out. A sense of urgency needs to be established. 
* **Slight Advantage:** Offering 52/48 gives me a slight edge while still being significantly better than Alice's proposals.
* **Finality:** By stating it's my final offer, I'm hoping to push Alice towards a decision rather than continuing this back and forth."
