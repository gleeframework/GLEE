"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the lead in the next round if you don't accept""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. I'm framing this as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead now, let's see if you'll accept a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,000 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with further reduced purchasing power. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
