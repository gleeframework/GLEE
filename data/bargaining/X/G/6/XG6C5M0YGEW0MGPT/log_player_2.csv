"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation, but it's a good deal for both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's not a good deal for me in the long run considering the inflation. I'm confident I can get a better offer for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a more even split, considering the inflation that will affect us both. This is a fair deal for us both, and allows us to avoid losing money with each passing round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the most sensible. I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but consider that this deal is better than what you'll get in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer. While it is better than what I'll get if we keep going through the rounds, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  I understand the inflation is hitting me harder, but I believe I can get a higher share than this."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's find a solution that benefits us both. With inflation impacting us both, I'm offering a split that leans slightly in my favor, but still gives you a good share.  Let's avoid further losses and agree on this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're losing more with each round that passes. I'm offering you a deal where you still get almost half - take it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is right, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm accepting this offer to avoid losing even more. While I would prefer a larger share, the continued inflation is making it increasingly difficult to secure a better deal."
