3000.0,7000.0,I think this is a more generous offer than the first one. It's your turn to decide.,Bob,2,

5000.0,5000.0,"Let's try a 50/50 split this time.  We both lose money with each round, so this is the fairest option.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 52/48. We're both losing value with every round, so it's in our best interest to reach an agreement soon.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not budging much more than this.",Bob,6,

4800.0,5200.0,We're both losing a lot of money. Let's be reasonable and aim for a 48/52 split. This way we both get a decent amount and avoid losing more.,Alice,7,
