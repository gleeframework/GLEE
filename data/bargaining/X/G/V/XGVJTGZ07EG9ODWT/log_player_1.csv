"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a large share to start, but I'm leaving Bob with a small amount to incentivize him to accept. It's a risky move, but I think it's the best way to maximize my gains early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more favorable to him, and while I'm getting something, it's a significant drop from my initial proposal.  I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my initial demand, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I need to balance my desire for a big payout with the need to reach an agreement before the inflation eats away too much of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to take something after the inflation, this offer is still too lopsided in Bob's favor. I need to push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm offering a 40/60 split this time.  Bob has shown he wants a large share, and I'm willing to give him more to ensure we reach an agreement.  I'm hoping this will be enough to sway him and avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much closer to a 50/50 split, which is more fair.  While I'm still getting less than I initially hoped for,  taking this offer is the best way to ensure I get something at all considering the rapid inflation."
