"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a good deal, but don't expect it to get better from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial amount, which is a relatively generous offer considering the inflation will eat away at the value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting taken advantage of that easily! I'll give you a small share, but I'm keeping most of the money. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze me dry!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $100,000 is actually worth $95,000 (5% less than the original $100,000).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept this offer.
