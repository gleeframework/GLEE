"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $60 and Bob receiving $40. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut will shrink faster than mine. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Given the effects of inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller cut this time. Don't wait for the next round, the money is losing value!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 58-42 split, with me receiving $58 and Bob receiving $42. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that I've taken a smaller cut this time and warning him that the money is losing value due to inflation, so it's better to accept this offer rather than waiting for the next round. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. 50/50 is the fairest split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. At this point, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and further negotiations would likely lead to even greater losses due to inflation. Accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable decision."
