"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a generous offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to consider that when making my decision. Bob's offer is 300,000 for me, which is 30% of the original 1,000,000. Considering the inflation, this is actually a relatively small share.

On the other hand, Bob is offering himself 700,000, which is 70% of the original amount. This is a significant amount, but since his money is worth 10% less due to inflation, it's not as good as it seems.

After careful consideration, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal""}

I'm proposing that I take 400,000 and Bob takes 600,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that gives Bob a slightly better deal than my initial offer, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll be fair 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Considering the severe inflation, my money is worth only 51.2% of its original value, so 150,000 is a very small share. On the other hand, Bob's money is worth 72.9% of its original value, so 850,000 is a significant amount.

While Bob's offer is not generous, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the severe inflation. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round, so I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
