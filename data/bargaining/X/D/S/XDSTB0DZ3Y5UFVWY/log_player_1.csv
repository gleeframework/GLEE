Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take 90% of the money!  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept such a small share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is not ideal, I'm accepting it. The inflation means that my gains are significantly lower, and I risk losing a lot more if I reject and go to another round. It's better to secure a small portion of the money than risk getting nothing at all."
