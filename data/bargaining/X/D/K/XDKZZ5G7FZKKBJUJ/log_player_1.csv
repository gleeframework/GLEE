"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor, Alice.  This gives you the majority of the money, but also leaves Bob with a small portion.  I think this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
``` 

I'm offering 8100 for myself and 1900 for Bob.  This is still a significant portion for me, but it's also a better deal for Bob than his last offer. I hope this will lead to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm offering 7290 for myself and 2710 for Bob.  While this is a significant reduction from my initial offer, it's still a substantial amount, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given the current inflation.  I hope this will finally lead to an agreement."
