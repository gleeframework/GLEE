"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm confident we can find a better deal for both of us in the future. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a fair split is tempting, the inflation means that waiting for a round where I get a better deal might be worth it."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to take a bit less than half to avoid further inflation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation has reduced the value of my gains significantly. It's better to accept this offer and avoid further losses."
