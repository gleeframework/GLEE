Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. I take 750,000$ and you take 250,000$. This ensures we both benefit from the initial amount before inflation starts affecting its value.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. We both take 500,000$ each, and we can end the game now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
