Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 99% of the money and give Bob 1%. I want to maximize my share, but I also want to give Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, this offer is still very favorable considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing in the end.  It's a fair split and a good way to secure a significant portion of the money."
