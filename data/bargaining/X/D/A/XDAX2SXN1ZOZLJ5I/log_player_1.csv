"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in the first round, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about the offer.

I'm not sure if 50/50 is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. But I don't want to reject it without considering it further. I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll try to be more aggressive with my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure you're being fair, Bob. I'm taking a bigger share this time.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share too. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the money is worth significantly less now, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives me only 40%. I'll think carefully about it...

However, I don't want to reject it outright, since I'm not sure what Bob's next offer will be. I'll play it safe for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
