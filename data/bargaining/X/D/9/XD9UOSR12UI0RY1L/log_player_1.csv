# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you hard, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is making this offer increasingly less attractive.  It's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all."
