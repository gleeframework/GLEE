I propose to keep 9000$ and give Bob 1000$. I think this is a fair split, considering I am the one making the proposal.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  Even though the money is worth less, I still think I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll make a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```

I'm offering to keep 6000$ and give Bob 4000$.  I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve a larger share of the money. Let's see if this is acceptable to Bob."
