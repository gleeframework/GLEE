"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal for myself this round 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about giving up more money, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
