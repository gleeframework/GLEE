"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates.  Let's see what you think, Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a terrible offer.  Even with the inflation, I'm getting significantly less than before.  Let's see what I can do with my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm going to try and find a middle ground. I'm reducing my share a bit, but still giving myself a better deal than Bob's proposal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

This is getting ridiculous.  Even with the inflation, I'm still getting significantly less than half the money.  I'm not going to accept this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

This is getting absurd. I'm not going to accept such a ridiculously small share of the money, even with inflation.  I'll take my chances and try to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

This is getting ridiculous. I'm not going to accept such a small share of the money, even with inflation.  I'm not going to give in to his greed.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

We're running out of time, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  I'm willing to go down to 35% to secure a deal, but I can't go any lower.  Let's make a decision before the money becomes completely worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

# Alice gain: 0.1 
# Bob gain: 99.9

This offer is insulting.  Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I refuse to accept such a small share of the money. I'll take my chances and see if we can reach a fairer agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 25, ""bob_gain"": 75}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I need to make a move. I'm willing to go down to 25% of the money, hoping that Bob will recognize the urgency of the situation and accept.  This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's the best chance we have to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0.01 
# Bob gain: 99.99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy.  I'm not going to accept a measly $0.01, even with the inflation.  It's clear we're not going to reach an agreement, and we'll both end up with nothing.  It's a shame, but I'm not willing to accept being exploited like this."
