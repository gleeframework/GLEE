Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the deal is getting worse. Let's settle this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being patient. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly playing on the inflation factor to pressure me. However, I need to hold my ground a bit longer. Accepting $4300 now is a significant loss compared to what I could have gained earlier. I'll make one more strong offer before I start seriously considering her terms."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is it. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option.  Take it or leave it.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 was too late, now I want more. 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is getting dangerous, but I'm not accepting an offer where I get less than $5000, especially when it was achievable just a round ago. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation, but I need to show some resolve. I'm hoping she starts to feel the pressure of the shrinking pot in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be realistic. I'm taking a hit here, but this offer prevents further losses for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm getting more. 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  It pains me to accept this, but time has become my worst enemy. Accepting $3900 is far better than getting nothing in the end. Alice played the game well, exploiting the inflation and my initial reluctance to accept a less favorable deal."
