Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a slightly larger share, but you'll still get a good amount.  What do you say?

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what I can get with my own proposal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's start with this, and we can adjust in later rounds if needed.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time.  I think that's the fairest way to go, and it avoids any further arguments about who gets more. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is fair, and the inflation is starting to bite.  Let's take it."
