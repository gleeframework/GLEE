"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a fair share considering the initial amount and the fact that the money is worth 20% less for him each round. My message is a friendly reminder that this is a good deal and we can wrap up the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal, Alice. We can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. However, I'm not convinced that this is a fair deal for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast, Bob! I'm not willing to give up that much. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6300,
  ""bob_gain"": 3700,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
