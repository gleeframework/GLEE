I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement. I'll see if he's willing to accept a smaller share to get the money now, or if he wants to risk the inflation and propose a different split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to turn the tables on me! While his offer is still generous in terms of the total amount I would receive, the inflation hit him harder than me. This means that if I accept, I'm essentially getting less than what I offered him in the previous round. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, hoping to find a compromise.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to get a deal quickly. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm also considering the risk of the game continuing and potentially losing even more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation has really hit Bob hard, and his offer reflects that.  While I'd prefer to have a larger share, it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and the risk of continuing and potentially ending up with nothing is too high."
