"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer heavily favors you due to the inflation. I propose a more balanced split that recognizes the decreasing value of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
