"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take most of the money, but you'll get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, this way we both get a fair share and avoid the risk of inflation.""}
