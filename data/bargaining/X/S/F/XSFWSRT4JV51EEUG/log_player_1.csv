"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, then we can reassess""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can see how the game plays out from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my offer from the first round is no longer as attractive, and Bob's offer is a more reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
