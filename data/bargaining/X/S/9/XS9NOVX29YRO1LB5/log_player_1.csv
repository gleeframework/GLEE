Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 60:40 split in favor of Alice. This might seem fair given the initial value of the money.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 7:3 is a more reasonable split, considering the value of the money will decrease over time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
