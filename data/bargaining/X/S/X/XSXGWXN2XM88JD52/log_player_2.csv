Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money, Bob. I think a 60/40 split in my favor is reasonable considering the inflation rate.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair considering the inflation we're both facing. Let's work together to maximize our gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still not quite there. I'm willing to come down slightly to a 58/42 split. This accounts for the inflation while ensuring a reasonable outcome for both of us. Time is ticking, let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
