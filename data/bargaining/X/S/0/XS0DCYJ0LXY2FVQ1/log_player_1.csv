Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very unfair division in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it out of fear of getting nothing in the next round.  Let's see how greedy he is!  ðŸ˜ˆ"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still quite unfair, it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round. The inflation doesn't affect my gains, and the 100,000$ is a decent amount to start with.  I'll take it!"
