# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the value is decreasing, I still hold some leverage as Alice doesn't want the deal to fall through entirely. I need to push for a slightly better split before the inflation eats away too much of my potential gain."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation hurts me further.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your loss is my gain, literally 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The relentless march of inflation has me backed into a corner. Accepting a lower offer now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. It's frustrating, but I need to secure something before the value diminishes even further."
