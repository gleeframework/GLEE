"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both walk away with a tidy sum!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get peanuts, but I'm willing to let you leave with something! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, looks like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

I'll think carefully... With the money worth 20% less, I'd be getting $80,000, which is a significant reduction from the initial $800,000. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, as the value of the money will continue to decrease.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
