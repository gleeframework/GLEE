"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can move on to the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power.

In this round, I'm offered $2,000, which is worth the same as $2,000 in the first round. However, I need to consider the inflation factor for Bob's gain. Since the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, his $8,000 is actually worth $7,200 in terms of its purchasing power.

Given the current state of the game, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but I'm still keeping a slightly larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting desperate, but I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so his $7,000 is actually worth $5,119.70 in terms of its purchasing power.

Considering the current state of the game, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm now offering Bob a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable proposal."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000

Considering the current state of the game, I think I should take this offer. $1,000 is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with less money.
