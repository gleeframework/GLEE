"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I need more than 45%. How about a 60/40 split? This way, we both gain something and save time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, accepting this offer would still give her a significantly larger share. It's important to hold firm and aim for a more balanced outcome, especially since we're only in round 3."
