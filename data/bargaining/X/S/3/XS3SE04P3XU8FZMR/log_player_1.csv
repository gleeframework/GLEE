"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm offering a slightly more skewed split, where I'll take 40% and Bob will take 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the money is worth less now, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than my previous one, I'll consider accepting this one.
