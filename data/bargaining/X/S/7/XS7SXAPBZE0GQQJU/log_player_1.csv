"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates will impact us both differently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a better split, the inflation rate means I'll lose more if I keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer is the most financially sound decision at this point."
