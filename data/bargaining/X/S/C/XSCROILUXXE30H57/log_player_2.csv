Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. 55 for me, 45 for you. This accounts for the inflation and gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
