"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20%, which is $20. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
