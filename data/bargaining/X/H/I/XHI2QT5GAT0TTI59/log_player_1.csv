"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision...

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $300,000, especially considering the value of money is decreasing with each round. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous this time, but still keeping a slight edge, considering the decreasing value of money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more balanced offer this time!

Considering the decreasing value of money, I think this offer is a reasonable one. I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the $500,000 and call it a day!"
