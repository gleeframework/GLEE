"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 60/40 in my favor, which is a relatively fair split considering the game's mechanics."
