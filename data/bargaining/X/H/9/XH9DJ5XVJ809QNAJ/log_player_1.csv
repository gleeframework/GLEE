"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm hoping for a better deal. I'll pass.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping it'll be more generous!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the second round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger bite. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm aiming for a better deal this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share. Don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the reduced value, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, I'll take it. Better than nothing!""
}
```

I'll take the 75$ and call it a day. It's not the best deal, but it's better than going to another round with inflation eating away at my potential gain!"
