"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $480,000. Bob's $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $360,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully...

I'll reject this offer. My goal is to get as much as possible, and this offer doesn't seem too appealing. I'll wait for a better one.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect, my money is now worth 64% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
