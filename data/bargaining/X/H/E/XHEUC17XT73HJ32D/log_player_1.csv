"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting we split the $100 evenly. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can't do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is still a decent amount.

I'll think carefully... and decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher gain to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more this time, but still a fair offer, Bob!""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm the one making the offers now! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the offer, my gain of 30 is worth only 48.8% of what it was in the first round, which is a relatively small amount. However, I don't want to risk going lower.

I'll think carefully... and decide to accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
