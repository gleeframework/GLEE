Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's find a middle ground. This offer is a compromise, considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out here.  This is my final offer - let's be smart and take it. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the game is getting dangerously close to the end. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, consider these factors:

* **Time pressure:**  We're at round 5, with 7 rounds left.  Things get riskier the longer this goes on.
* **Inflation:** My potential gains are eroding much faster than Alice's. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than risking a worse offer later or getting nothing.
* **Alice's tone:** Her message suggests this is her final offer. If I reject it, she might dig in her heels, leading to a stalemate and zero gain for both of us.

It's a tough call, but in this situation, it's better to take a decent offer while it's still on the table.
