"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable split. I take $60, you take $40.  It's important to settle this early before inflation eats away at our potential gains.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair, given the risk of inflation. Let's take $55 each and call it a day.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a larger hit from inflation. I'll take $58, and you get $42. This is a better deal than you'll get in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
