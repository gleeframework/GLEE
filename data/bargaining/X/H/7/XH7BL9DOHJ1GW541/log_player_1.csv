I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  Since we're dealing with inflation, I'm aiming for a large chunk now, before the money loses value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but acknowledging the inflation factor. I'm reducing my share slightly to make the offer more appealing, but still maintaining a significant advantage."
