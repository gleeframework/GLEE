"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with each of us getting $400,000. I'm leaving a message for Bob to consider this fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I get to make the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money is now worth $900,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
