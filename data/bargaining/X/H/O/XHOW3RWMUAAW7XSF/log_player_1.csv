"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll still give you a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and Bob's proposal is too skewed in his favor. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:
