Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still a significant drop from my initial proposal. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'm still confident I can negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try a compromise.  I'm reducing my share by 15 to see if we can reach an agreement.  I still want a majority, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous! Bob is being incredibly stubborn.  While I'm losing money with each round, it's still better to hold out for a more fair split.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him to come back to the table with something more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to try one more time to meet in the middle. I'm reducing my share to 70, which is still more than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping he realizes that continued rejection will only hurt him in the long run, as the money will keep depreciating for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy! This offer is worse than his last one, and I'm losing more money each round. I'm not going to give in to his demands. I'll keep fighting for a better deal, even though the odds are stacked against me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm getting desperate, but I'm still trying to hold out for a fair deal. I'm reducing my share to 60, but this is my final offer. Bob needs to understand that if he keeps rejecting, he'll end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly unreasonable! This offer is worse than his previous one, and I'm losing a significant amount of money each round. I'm not going to give in to his demands. I'll keep fighting for a better deal, even though the odds are stacked against me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  This is a true compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point, given how much value I've lost due to inflation. Bob needs to realize that continued rejection will only hurt him in the long run, as the money will keep depreciating for me.  We both have something to gain from this deal."
