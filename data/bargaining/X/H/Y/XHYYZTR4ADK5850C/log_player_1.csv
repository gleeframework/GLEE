"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I'm going for a high gain for myself, but leaving a small amount for Bob to make him more likely to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. Even though I get less than my initial proposal, the inflation means that I'll end up with less money if I reject and go to another round. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation."
