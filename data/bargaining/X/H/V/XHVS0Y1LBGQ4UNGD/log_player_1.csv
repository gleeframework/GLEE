"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer.  I'm taking a large share, but I'm hoping to secure a deal quickly before the inflation kicks in too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic cut.  I'll counter with a proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly, but still offering a significant portion to Bob. I believe this is a fair offer, especially considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer isn't ideal, the inflation is becoming a significant factor.  I'd rather take the $580,000 now and minimize the further losses from inflation."
