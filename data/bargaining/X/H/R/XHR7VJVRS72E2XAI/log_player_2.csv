Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round due to inflation, but the money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round. Alice's last offer was $300,000 for me and $700,000 for her, which I rejected.

### Step 2: Determine my next offer
Given that Alice's offer of $300,000 for me was not acceptable and considering the inflation, my next offer should aim to find a middle ground while also taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Since I previously offered $400,000 for myself and $600,000 for Alice and she rejected it, I should consider adjusting my offer to make it more appealing to her while still trying to maximize my gain.

### Step 3: Calculate the adjusted offer considering inflation
Since the money I gain is worth 9.75% less, I need to adjust my offer to compensate for this loss. However, the game's structure suggests that the actual value of the money does not directly influence the offer but rather the decision-making process. Thus, my focus should be on negotiating a higher share to offset the perceived loss due to inflation.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer and message
Given the rejection of my previous offer and considering the need to find a mutually agreeable solution, I will adjust my offer slightly to make it more appealing to Alice while still aiming for a higher share than her last offer to me.

### Step 5: Finalize the offer and message
I will offer $450,000 for myself and $550,000 for Alice, aiming to find a compromise that is closer to my target while considering the effects of inflation and the negotiation dynamics.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation and our previous offers, I believe this is a fair compromise.""}"
