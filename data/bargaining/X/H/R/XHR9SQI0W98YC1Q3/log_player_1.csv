Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both feeling the pinch of inflation.  This offer gives you a good amount, but also leaves me with something to work with. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough one! However, with inflation eating away at my potential gains, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting.  While I'd prefer a higher amount, accepting Bob's offer now guarantees me something that's still better than what I might be left with if I reject and have to make an offer in Round 5."
