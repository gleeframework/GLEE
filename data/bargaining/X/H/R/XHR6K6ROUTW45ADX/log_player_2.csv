"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but a 70/30 split is still too lopsided. Let's try a 60/40 split. This acknowledges the inflation while still giving us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
