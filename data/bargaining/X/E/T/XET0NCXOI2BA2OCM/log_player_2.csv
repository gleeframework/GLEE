I'm going to reject this offer. I know the money will lose value each round, but I want to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice a much smaller share than she offered me. I hope that she'll accept, as I know the money will be worth less in the next round."
