Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a very stubborn game, counting on Bob cracking under the pressure of inflation. However, Bob is proposing reasonable splits and needs to hold firm. Accepting $43 now is a significant loss compared to potentially getting a better deal in a later round, even with inflation. Bob needs to show Alice he's serious about getting a fair share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal at this point.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 is not as fair as you think, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is blatantly trying to manipulate Bob with the inflation factor. While it's true Bob's potential gains are decreasing, accepting a deal heavily skewed in Alice's favor just because of the time pressure is a bad strategy. Bob offered a fair 50/50 split, and Alice needs to understand that her stubbornness will have consequences.  There's still a chance she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be realistic. I'm willing to compromise slightly. This is a take it or leave it offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for Bob to show some flexibility, but not too much. A 48/52 split is still favorable to Alice, but acknowledges the time pressure and might be enough to get her to agree. By framing it as his final offer, Bob increases the pressure on Alice to accept. If she continues to refuse, Bob will need to re-evaluate his strategy in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, it's time for Bob to cut his losses. Accepting $45 now is much better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds. Alice is clearly committed to her strategy of waiting out Bob, and the inflation factor is becoming increasingly detrimental. It's a disappointing outcome, but better than losing everything by remaining stubborn."
