"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I think this is a fair split, and I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly opening message to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. Let's finish this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain has decreased by 5% due to inflation, so I need to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% gain for myself, especially considering the decreasing value of money. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more balanced split considering the decreasing value of money. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we should aim for a fair split, considering the inflation factor."
