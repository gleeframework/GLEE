I'm going to start by being generous with Bob. I'll offer him $1000, hoping he'll accept and we can both get our share quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. With the inflation, my potential gains in future rounds are decreasing.  A 50/50 split guarantees me a decent amount of money, and the risk of losing even more isn't worth it."
