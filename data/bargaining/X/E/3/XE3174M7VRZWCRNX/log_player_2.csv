Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're being greedy, Bob! I'll give you a better deal this time. Let's try again! 
# Bob gain: 700000 
# Alice gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Alice is making a better deal now. I'll take the 700,000. It's worth less, but I'm not going to push my luck!"
