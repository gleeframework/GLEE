"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60:40 split is a more reasonable division, considering the risks and benefits of this investment. I'm willing to give you a higher share this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
