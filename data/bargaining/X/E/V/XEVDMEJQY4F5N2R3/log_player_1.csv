Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it a bit more fairly this time, I'll take the bigger share since the money doesn't lose value for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. I'm tired of haggling, and we both get a decent amount.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money loses value for you, I think I should take a bigger share. This is my final offer, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the $3000, as the money is losing value for me very quickly. Taking this deal is better than risking getting nothing at all if I reject and he doesn't offer anything in the next round."
