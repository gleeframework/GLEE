50.0,50.0,Let's start fair. 50/50 seems like a good place to begin. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think I deserve a bit more, 55/45 is still a good deal for you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,I'm not convinced by your argument. Let's stick to a fair 50/50 split.  It's the most sensible way to ensure we both get something.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"You didn't budge, so I'll try again. 58/42 is my new offer. Time is running out, and inflation is eating away our money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to budge a bit, but 58/42 is too lopsided.  Let's compromise at 55/45. We're both losing money with each passing round, so let's get this done.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"I see you're willing to move, but I still think I can get a bit more. 60/40 is my new offer. Inflation is really taking its toll, so think carefully.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"We're losing too much money with each round. Let's just split it evenly and be done with it. 50/50, no more arguing.",Alice,7,
