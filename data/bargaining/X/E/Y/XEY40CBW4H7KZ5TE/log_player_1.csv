"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take half, you can take the other half. It's simple. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 90% of the original $50, which is $45. Bob's gain of $50 is now worth 80% of the original $50, which is $40.

I'm not sure I like this offer, as I'd rather get a bit more than $45. But it's a simple and straightforward proposal, and it's not a bad deal either. I'll accept this offer.
