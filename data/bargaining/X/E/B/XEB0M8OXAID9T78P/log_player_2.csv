Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more than half. This is my counteroffer.""}\n\nLet's see if Alice accepts this offer. Since it's the second round, the money is now worth 10% less for me, so I'll have to keep that in mind for future offers."
