```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money, it's a good starting point!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more for my efforts! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided offer from Bob!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm not accepting an offer that leaves me with just 3,000$. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
