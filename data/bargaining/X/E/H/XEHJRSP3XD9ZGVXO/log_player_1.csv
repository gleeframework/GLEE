"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4000/6000 split, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With the inflation, $4000 is equivalent to $4,000 / (1 - 0.05) = $4,230 in the first round.

I'll think about it... and decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too lopsided, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to get a better deal.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. This is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to adjust my thinking again. With the 14.26% inflation, $4800 is equivalent to $4800 / (1 - 0.1426) = $5554 in the first round.

I'll think about it... and decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make another proposal that's a bit more aggressive, considering the continued erosion of the money's value.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid further inflation""}

I'm proposing a 58/42 split, with me getting $5,800 and Bob getting $4,200. This is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a decent chunk of the money before it loses even more value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800

Considering the new offer, I'll have to adjust my thinking again. With the 22.62% inflation, $5200 is equivalent to $5200 / (1 - 0.2262) = $6694 in the first round.
