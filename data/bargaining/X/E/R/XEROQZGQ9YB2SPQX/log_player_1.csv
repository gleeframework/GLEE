"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can move on to the next round, or I'll make an even better offer next time.""
}
```

This offer gives me $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to be too generous 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is being a bit stingy!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's not as good as my initial offer, it's still a decent amount for me. On the other hand, I don't want to give up too much and risk getting stuck with a bad deal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the split. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""This is a fair compromise, considering the initial offer. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and giving Bob a decent amount, while also keeping the pressure on to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to give you the majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is being even more aggressive with his offer this time!

I'm not thrilled about giving up a majority of the money, but I also don't want to risk getting stuck with nothing. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with giving up such a large share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.""
}
```"

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""This is a more balanced split. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount for myself."

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is getting a bit more aggressive and is trying to squeeze me out!

I'm not thrilled about giving up such a large share, but I also don't want to risk getting stuck with nothing. However, I'm not going to give in to Bob's demands so easily.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up such a large share. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.""
}
```"
