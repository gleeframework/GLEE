"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair offer. Let me know what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less to me in this round, Bob's offer of $5,000 is actually equivalent to $4,500 in the first round. I think I can do better than that, so I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you""
}


I've taken into account the inflation and decreased the amount I'm offering to take, while still trying to get a slightly better deal than an even split. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need more than 4200 to make it worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWith the inflation, Bob's offer of $4,500 is actually worth even less to me now. I'll take my chances and try to get a better deal in the next round. Bob seems willing to negotiate, so I'll make another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 5600,
  ""bob_gain"": 4400,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us both, let's find a middle ground""
}\n\nI'll try to find a middle ground, considering the inflation is affecting both of us. I'm willing to take a bit less than before, but still want to get a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if he's willing to accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to concede a bit more, but we need to come to an agreement soon, the money is losing value quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, I think it's time to accept Bob's offer. $4,000 is better than risking further devaluation, and it seems Bob is also motivated to come to an agreement. I'll take the offer and end the game here."
