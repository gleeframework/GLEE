Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45. It's a better deal for me, but you still get a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money.  It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Concession, but Firm:** Bob's counter-offer showed he's unlikely to accept less than 45%. I'm mirroring his proposal from round 2 to signal I'm willing to compromise, but not be walked over.
* **Clear Communication:** The message emphasizes fairness and the need to act before inflation eats further into the potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is Biting:** The value of the money has significantly decreased. Holding out for a better deal in later rounds is becoming increasingly risky. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While Bob's offer isn't ideal, the difference between his current offer and my previous one is now quite small after accounting for inflation. Continuing to negotiate might yield only marginally better results.
* **Risk of Losing More:** If I reject this and Bob becomes more aggressive in the next round, I risk ending up with even less.  

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a much smaller share later."
