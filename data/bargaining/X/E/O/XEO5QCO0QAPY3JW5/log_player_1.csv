Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic example of the Ultimatum Game. I'm offering Bob a tiny portion of the money, knowing that he might accept it just to get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep more, it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  Each round increases the risk of getting nothing as Bob's discount on his share increases. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and it's better than risking a potential loss in the next round."
