"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $100, which is a relatively generous offer considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll think twice before accepting.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a more reasonable offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a smaller share this time. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting now!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'm not in a great position. The money I gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, and Bob is taking a larger share.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a more reasonable offer in the next round, but I'm not getting my hopes up!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 20,
  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a significant share. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money now, considering the significant inflation. I'm offering Bob a large share, but I'm hoping he'll see it as a reasonable compromise to end the game."
