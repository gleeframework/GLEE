"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  This is a good starting point, as it gives me a significant share while still offering Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer. I'm proposing a 700,000/300,000 split in my favor. This is a compromise, but I need to regain some of what I lost with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, accepting this offer is the best option. It provides a decent sum, and rejecting it risks further inflation and a potentially worse offer in the next round."
