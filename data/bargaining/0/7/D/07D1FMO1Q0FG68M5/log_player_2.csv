"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.  We can adjust in future rounds.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a good starting point, but I'm hoping for a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go a bit lower than your offer, but I think a 65/35 split is still fair considering inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is a real concern. Accepting a 35% share is better than risking further losses."
