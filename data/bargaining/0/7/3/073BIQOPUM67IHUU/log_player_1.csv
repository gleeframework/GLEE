Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

For Round 2, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
