"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a fairly standard starting offer in a game like this. Alice takes the majority, but leaves a small amount for Bob to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is less than what Alice initially proposed, it's still a gain for Alice.  Since the money is worth the same for Alice, there's no incentive to keep rejecting and risk getting a worse offer in the next round due to Bob's inflation advantage."
