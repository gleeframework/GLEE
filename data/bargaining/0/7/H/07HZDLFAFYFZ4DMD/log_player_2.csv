"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 4:1, I'll make the first move. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. It's a very lopsided split in Alice's favor, and I think I can do better by negotiating.  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 55/45 split. Let's compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer again. While it's a better split than the first round, I still think I can get a better deal.  Alice is already showing a willingness to compromise, so I'm going to keep pushing for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I need a bit more. 60/40 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer an even split, we're getting closer to the end of the game, and the money is rapidly losing value. It's better to accept Alice's offer than risk getting nothing at all."
