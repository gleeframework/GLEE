"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll make the first move.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive than I was hoping for, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55/45 split. Let's compromise.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly more balanced split, but still trying to get a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a more equal split now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up my advantage yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to squeeze out a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth less and less, I'll try to make a stronger move.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I need a bit more. 60/40 is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm pushing for a 60/40 split, trying to get the majority of the remaining value."
