"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself, with a message of ""Let's share fairly!"" to persuade him to accept the offer. Since the money's value decreases with each round, I want to end the game as quickly as possible while still getting a larger share. I am hoping that Bob will find this offer reasonable and accept it to avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn for a better split. Think about the decreasing value! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the decreasing value of money, I believe I can still get a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I want to try to get as much as possible in the next round. Additionally, Bob's offer gives him a significantly larger share, which I don't think is fair considering the initial amount was $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob $450,000 and taking $550,000 for myself, with a message of ""Meet me in the middle!"" to try to find a compromise. Since the money's value is decreasing rapidly for me, I want to end the game as soon as possible while still getting a relatively larger share. By offering a more even split than my initial proposal, I hope Bob will see this as a fair deal and accept it, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
