"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, we can always negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, leaving me with the majority of the 100 dollars. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can always adjust the division as we go along."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, my effective gain in this round is 63 dollars (90 - 10% of 90 = 0.9 * 90 = 81, but since the amount is 60, it's actually 60).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as I was hoping to get a better deal. However, I don't want to reject it outright, as it's still a relatively good compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round for me, my effective gain in this round is 54 dollars (60 - 10% of 60 = 0.9 * 60 = 54).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 54,
  ""bob_gain"": 46,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think we can do better than this. Let's try to find a more optimal solution. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round for me, my effective gain in this round is 36.9 dollars (90 - 27.1% of 90 = 0.7289 * 90 = 65.57, but since the amount is 50, it's actually 50).

However, I'm considering the offer from Bob, which is a 50-50 split. This is a good compromise, and it's a fair deal considering the current value of the money.
