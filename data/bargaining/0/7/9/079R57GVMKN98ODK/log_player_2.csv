Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  I'll take 45, and you can have 55.  We're both getting closer to what we want, and the money is losing value quickly. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
