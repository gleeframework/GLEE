Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept. I want to see how he reacts to this initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is terrible! It's only 10 dollars for me, and that's worth even less now because of the inflation. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. I think Bob might be willing to accept something closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm going to try and get a better deal first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous. Bob is still offering me a tiny fraction of the money. Even though my share is worth less due to inflation, I'm not going to accept such a bad deal. I'm going to keep pushing for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a decent share. Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that we both need to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting frustrating. Bob is being incredibly stubborn.  Even though my share is worth much less due to inflation, I refuse to accept such a grossly unfair offer. I'm going to keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but I'm still trying to get a fair share. I'm starting to worry about the time running out, but I'm not giving up yet.  I think Bob might be starting to realize he needs to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous!  Bob is completely ignoring the impact of inflation on me.  I refuse to accept this unfair offer, even though my share is now worth very little.  I'm going to keep trying to find a more reasonable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're running out of time, and the inflation is killing my share. I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest offer I can make at this point, and hopefully, Bob will finally see that we need to reach a compromise."
