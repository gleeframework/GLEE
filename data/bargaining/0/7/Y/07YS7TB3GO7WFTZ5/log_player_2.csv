"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate affects me less. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This offer is not fair considering the different inflation rates. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this round. We both lose money with each passing round, so it's in our best interest to agree now.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and we're both losing money. Let's meet in the middle - this is a slight improvement on my previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I'm losing money faster than Alice, and I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the difference from the last round. Let's come to an agreement before we lose too much more money.""}
```"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need a bit more to make it worth the risk of continued inflation. This is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not fair considering the significant inflation we are both facing.  I need a better deal to compensate for the losses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to concede a bit this time, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable share before things get even worse.  Let's split the difference from the last round and reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We are both losing a lot with every round. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting too risky to keep rejecting offers.  While I'd prefer a slightly better deal for myself, the inflation is eating away at our gains, and a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise at this point."
