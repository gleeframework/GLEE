"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob an equal share of 50% of the $10,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, his offer is equivalent to him offering me $4,800 and keeping $6,000.

I'll think about it... I'd rather have a bit more money, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value for my share. I'll accept this offer.
