"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In terms of the actual value of the money, I would be getting $40 * 0.9 = $36.

Considering the offer from Bob, I would be getting $60, which is worth the same as in the first round.

I think I'll take the risk and accept Bob's offer this time.
