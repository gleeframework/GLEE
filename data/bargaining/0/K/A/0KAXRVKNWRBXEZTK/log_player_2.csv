Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about fairness. How about a compromise?  This is closer to a 50/50 split while still acknowledging the inflation disadvantage I face. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
