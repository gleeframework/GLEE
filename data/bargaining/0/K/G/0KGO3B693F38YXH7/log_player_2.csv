"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll try to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 60/40, but in my favor this time. I think this is a fairer split considering how much more the inflation affects you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation dynamic is in your favor, but a 60/40 split in your favor is too much. I propose a 55/45 split, which is a compromise considering the time pressure on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite, and Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise."
