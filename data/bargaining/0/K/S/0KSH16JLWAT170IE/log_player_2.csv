Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently undervaluing the speed of her own losses due to inflation. While my offers may seem self-interested, they are actually getting closer to a truly fair split with each round as the relative value of her share diminishes faster. I'll hold out for a better offer closer to my terms."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real.  The value is plummeting.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""} 

**Reasoning:**

By round 6, the inflation is starting to become a significant factor. Offering a 50/50 split, while seeming generous on the surface, is actually very advantageous to Bob.  Here's why:

* **Highlighting the Loss:**  By emphasizing the rapid devaluation, I'm making Alice acutely aware of the potential losses with every rejected offer. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  Offering an even split makes me look fair and willing to compromise, which could make Alice more receptive. 
* **Future Leverage:** If she rejects this offer, I have a strong argument for pushing a more favorable split in subsequent rounds, as she'll be losing value much faster than I am."
