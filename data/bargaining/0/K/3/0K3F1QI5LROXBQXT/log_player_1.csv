"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the remaining wealth equally in the future.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair and reasonable offer.  Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make a more aggressive offer in the second round!

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 10% of the remaining amount. I'll wait for the next round to make my next move!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""A fair compromise, considering the inflation. Let's end this game now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still keeping a significant portion for myself."
