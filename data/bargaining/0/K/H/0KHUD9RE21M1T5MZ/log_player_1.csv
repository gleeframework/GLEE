"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a bit less than half, considering that the money loses value for him faster. This should incentivize him to accept the offer rather than proceeding to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's close this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, Bob's offer of $550,000 is actually worth 20% less than its face value, making it effectively $440,000. Meanwhile, I would be getting $450,000, which is still worth its full value. I think I can do better than this, so I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is costly, settle now""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, Bob's portion will be worth even less in the next round. I'm increasing my share to $700,000, while offering Bob $300,000. This should put pressure on Bob to accept, as the value of his potential gain is decreasing rapidly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share, his offer of $450,000 is now effectively worth only about $230,000. Meanwhile, I would be getting $550,000, which is still worth its full value. Given that Bob claims this is his final offer, I'm not likely to get a better deal in the next round. I'll accept this offer to secure the $550,000."
