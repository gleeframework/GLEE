I'm starting with a fairly generous offer. I'll keep 90% for myself, but give Bob 10% to get the game started. Let's see if he takes it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though I'm getting less than I initially proposed, I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to play. The inflation is working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to increase my share slightly. I'm offering Bob 40% now. Since he rejected my previous offer, I assume he's valuing his share more highly. I'll continue to be generous but I want to secure a larger portion of the money for myself."
