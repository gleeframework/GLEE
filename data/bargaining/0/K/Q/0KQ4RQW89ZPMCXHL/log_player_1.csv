Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, given that I am the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  I think this is a fair compromise after Bob's aggressive initial offer, and I'm willing to concede some ground to avoid further rounds of potential losses."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50/50 split.  I believe this is the fairest option at this point, considering the significant inflation that has occurred.  We can avoid further potential losses and end the game with an equal share."
