}
```

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is sticking to the 60-40 split, but now it's in his favor.

```

Round 3

```

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is now proposing a 55-45 split, but this time in his favor. Considering the effects of inflation, I'm not willing to accept a 45% share.
