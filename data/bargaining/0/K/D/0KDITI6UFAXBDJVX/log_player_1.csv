I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  Since Bob's money is worth 10% less each round, I want to maximize my share now.  Hopefully, he'll accept even a small amount!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is much better for him than my offer was for me.  I'm not going to accept that. I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced offer this time, but still heavily skewed in my favor. Since the money is losing value for both of us, I think it's important to reach a deal sooner rather than later. I'm giving Bob a larger share this time, hoping he'll be more inclined to accept."
