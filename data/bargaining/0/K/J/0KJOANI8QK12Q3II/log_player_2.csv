Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 60/40.  This acknowledges the inflation, but still gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
