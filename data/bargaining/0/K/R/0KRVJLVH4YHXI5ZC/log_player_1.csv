"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more due to the uncertainty of inflation 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is 40, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think 55 is a fair share considering the uncertainty of inflation""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob 45, which is a bit less than the 50 I initially proposed, but still a reasonable share considering the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 48, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation and the uncertainty of the game's outcome 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate decreasing, Bob's gain is worth even less now. Considering that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the equivalent value of his offer in the first round's currency. 

Let's assume the first round's currency is 100% value, and the current round's currency is 51.2% value (100 - 48.8% = 51.2%). To find the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round's currency, I'll divide his offer by 0.512 (51.2% as a decimal).

Bob's offer in the first round's currency is: 48 / 0.512 = 93.75

Since I initially offered 50 in the first round, I'll compare it to Bob's offer. 93.75 is more than 50, so I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make another proposal. Considering the inflation rate is still decreasing, I'll try to get a better deal this time.

I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Bob, but still keep in mind that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I think 60 is a fair share considering the inflation and the remaining rounds""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob 40, which is a bit less than the 45 I offered in round 3, but still a reasonable share considering the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation and the remaining rounds, and I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, Bob's gain is worth even less now. I'll calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round's currency.

Let's assume the first round's currency is 100% value, and the current round's currency is 32.77% value (100 - 67.23% = 32.77%). To find the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round's currency, I'll divide his offer by 0.3277 (32.77% as a decimal).

Bob's offer in the first round's currency is: 45 / 0.3277 = 137.5

Since I initially offered 50 in the first round, I'll compare it to Bob's offer. 137.5 is more than 50, so I'll reject this offer.

However, I notice that Bob is willing to compromise, and his offer is 45, which is a reasonable amount considering the inflation effect. I'll accept this offer.
