"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer. It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can get this game over with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 60/40 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse deal in the next round."
