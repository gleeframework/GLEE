Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  It seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  I'm getting 5000, which is less than my initial offer, but my initial offer was rejected.  The 5% inflation means that continuing to reject offers and going through more rounds would mean losing more money.  It's better to take the 5000 and end this game."
