"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, as it's a fair and straightforward offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60/40 split. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, Bob. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split a bit more in my favor, but still keeping it relatively close to a 50/50 split."

# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
