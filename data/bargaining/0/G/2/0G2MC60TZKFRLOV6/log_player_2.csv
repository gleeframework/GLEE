Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You know I'm not going for 50/50, try again 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While her offers are getting slightly better, they are nowhere near a fair split considering Bob's money is losing value rapidly. It's worth the risk to hold out for a better deal a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to apply pressure and set a firm boundary. Alice needs to understand that Bob won't be endlessly exploited. Offering 52/48 is still generous to Alice considering the inflation, but establishes a point beyond which Bob won't be pushed. The ""final offer"" statement adds weight, potentially pushing Alice to concede."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, take this deal 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, but she's still trying to take advantage. Her offer is slightly better, but Bob's losses to inflation are becoming significant. It's crucial to hold firm and demonstrate that he won't be pressured into a bad deal, even with the dwindling time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, that's it. We're splitting it 50/50 right now or the deal is off.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While Bob stood his ground, time is running out and the inflation is becoming a major factor.  Alice is likely to exploit this, knowing Bob is desperate to avoid getting nothing.  

This offer does the following:

* **Forces Alice's hand:**  No more negotiations. She either takes the fair deal now or risks getting nothing.
* **Establishes a clear bottom line:** Shows Bob is serious about not being taken advantage of.
* **Still leaves a small window:**  There are a few rounds left for Alice to reconsider if she initially rejects this offer, but the next round Bob should offer to take even less to avoid getting zero."
