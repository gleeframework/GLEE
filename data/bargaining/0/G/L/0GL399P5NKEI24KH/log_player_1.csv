"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% and take 60% for myself. Let's see if you accept!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the inflation rates. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob thinks a 60/40 split is fair, given the inflation rates.

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think 60/40 is fair, Bob. I'm willing to accept 55/45, but that's as low as I'll go.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, I'll aim to get a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise at 54/46, Bob. This is my last offer before I start getting really aggressive.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
