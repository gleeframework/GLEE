"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob receives the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly, but I'll take a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll get $6,000, which is 60% of the remaining $10,000. Bob will get $4,000, which is 40% of the remaining $10,000.

Considering the reduced value of money, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable than the first one. I'll accept Bob's offer.
