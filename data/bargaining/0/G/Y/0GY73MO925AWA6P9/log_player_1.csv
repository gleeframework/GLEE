"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 80/20 split is more fair considering the inflation we face. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm also looking to maximize my own return. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
