Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the inflation disproportionately affects me. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor to balance the losses we're facing with each passing round. This ensures a fairer outcome for both of us in the long run.

# Alice gain: 550000
