"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you a good deal""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70$ and Bob will get 30$, which is a relatively equal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is more fair. It's a good starting point, and we can work from there. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob!

Considering the new values, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 49 * 0.8 = 39.2 (due to 20% inflation from round 1 to round 2)
* Bob's gain: 51 * 0.95 = 48.45 (due to 5% inflation from round 1 to round 2)

With this in mind, I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 39.2$ gain, I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, considering the inflation is still affecting me more than Bob."
