"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our gains."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me, I still get $6000, but for Bob, his gain of $8000 is only worth 80% of what it was in the previous round.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to try to get a better deal.
