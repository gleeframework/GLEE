Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  This is my best offer. Take it or we'll both lose money! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round, Bob's potential earnings decrease significantly due to the 5% inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has indicated this is her ""best offer"" and implied a reluctance to negotiate further. Holding out might force her to completely withdraw, leaving Bob with nothing. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  While $10,000 is a far cry from a fair split, it's still better than walking away empty-handed, which is a real possibility if the game continues.

It's a classic case of cutting your losses.  Bob needs to be pragmatic and accept the best offer he's likely to get at this point."
