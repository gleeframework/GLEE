"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I believe this offer is fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, considering I'm losing 10% of the value each round, and I believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what I can propose next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation affects me less, I think this is a fairer split. Let's end this before the money loses more value!""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that slightly favors me, taking into account that the money loses value at a slower rate for me than for Alice. I'm hoping this will pressure Alice into accepting, given that the longer we negotiate, the less the money is worth to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Let's be reasonable and end this here before the inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the effects of inflation, Alice's offer seems reasonable at this point. The money is worth significantly less to both of us, but the rate of depreciation is higher for Alice. Given that Alice states this is her final offer and considering the diminishing value of the money, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action to ensure I walk away with something of value."
