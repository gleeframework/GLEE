Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was to give her 900,000, I'll offer her a bit less. I'll propose a 50/50 split, but considering the inflation, I'll give her a bit more than 500,000 to make it more appealing.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still quite lopsided. I'll try to propose a slightly better deal for myself this time.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less now. I'll try to propose a slightly more favorable split.
