"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point for negotiations. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than I expected, considering the previous round.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
