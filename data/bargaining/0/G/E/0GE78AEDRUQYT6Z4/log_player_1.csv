"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to finish quickly, so let's make a fair deal now. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While not ideal to get less than my initial offer, accepting this round prevents further losses due to inflation."
