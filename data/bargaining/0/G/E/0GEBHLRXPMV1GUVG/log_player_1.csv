Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see we're getting closer, but I still think I can get a bit more. How about 52/48? 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough one! While I'd prefer a slightly better split, accepting this offer guarantees a decent amount before inflation eats away more of the potential gains. It's a risk to reject, hoping for a better offer in later rounds."
