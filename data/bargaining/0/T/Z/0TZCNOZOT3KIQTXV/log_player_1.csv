I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  It's not a good deal for me, and I think I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a larger share this time, but I'm still keeping a significant amount for myself.  I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation."
