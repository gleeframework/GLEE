"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This is a fair deal, and we can avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to split it evenly, which is a fair deal.

I'll accept his offer.
