"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more even split, Alice. Let's try this and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to trick me with the same offer as before!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's the same offer as before, Bob. I'm not interested. I want a better deal.""
}
```

I'm not falling for it!"
