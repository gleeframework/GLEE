"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more to ensure a deal gets done quickly, given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than that! The difference between our shares is quite significant, and I'm not convinced that the urgency of the inflation warrants such a large disparity. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."
