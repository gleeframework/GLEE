"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in an 80:20 ratio, with me receiving 80% of the amount.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split in my favor.  This is a fair offer considering the declining value of the money for us.  I believe this will give us both a good share of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
