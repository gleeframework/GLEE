"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90, you get 10.  We can always adjust later if you think that's unfair. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a bit too lopsided to start. I'll see what she proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's try 60 for me, 40 for you.  We can always adjust as we go.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. How about 70 for me, 30 for you?  This way we're both getting a better deal than the last round, and we can keep adjusting as we go. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds and the inflation. This deal is better than the previous one and gives me a decent share."
