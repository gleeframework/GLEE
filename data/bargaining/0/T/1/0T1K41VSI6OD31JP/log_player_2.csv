"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money. This offer is fair given the rate of inflation we face. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. This offer is fair considering the inflation rate, and it's a good starting point for a quick agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hits you much harder. This is my final offer before the money starts losing serious value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting me hard and the money will be worth less with each passing round. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure something before the money becomes practically worthless."
