Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. This offer is fairer and gives us both more to start with. Let's work together to get this done!

# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we both want the most, but this offer gives us both a good starting point while minimizing losses from inflation. Let's get this done and start spending! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is trying to sound reasonable, this offer is still heavily skewed in his favor.  It's important to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair deal and won't just accept any offer as inflation eats away at the value. Bob's losses to inflation are accelerating faster than mine, which gives me some leverage."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 575000,
""bob_gain"": 425000,
""message"": ""Bob, this offer is a compromise. It acknowledges that we both need to gain, but the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows a willingness to move closer to Bob's desired split while still favoring Alice.
* **Urgency:**  Emphasizing the increasing losses due to inflation adds pressure on Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer positions Alice for a potentially more favorable counter-offer from Bob, as he sees the rounds progressing with no agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing a lot of money with each round. This offer is a fair split that will give us both a substantial amount and prevent further losses.  Let's call it even and move on. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Even Split:** Bob has finally conceded to a 50/50 split. 
* **Minimizing Losses:** While we've both lost a significant chunk to inflation, accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum, whereas holding out for a better deal in later rounds becomes increasingly risky. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split reflects a fair outcome given the initial conditions of the game."
