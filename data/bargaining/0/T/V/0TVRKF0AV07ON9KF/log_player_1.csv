"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, considering we're both starting with the full value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the initial offer was 60/40 in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the revised offer. I was expecting a more significant adjustment considering the 20% decrease in value. I'm willing to compromise, but 45/55 is still too far from my initial proposal. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50""}

I'm proposing a more balanced split, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway, hoping he'll accept this revised offer."
