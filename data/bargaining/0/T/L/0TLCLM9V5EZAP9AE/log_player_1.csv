"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to offer you a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to keep negotiating to see if I can get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and take less, but I'd like a slightly better share than 30. Let's meet in the middle on the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still gives him a majority. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on the majority, but I'll give you a token amount. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite one-sided! I'm not happy with the 85-15 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to keep negotiating to try to get a more balanced split. Bob's offer is too extreme, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further and take less, but I'd like to get closer to a 50-50 split. Let's meet in the middle on the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit closer to a 50-50 split than my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
