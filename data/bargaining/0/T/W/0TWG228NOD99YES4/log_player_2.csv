"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject the offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I can likely get a better deal for myself in the next round since I know Alice's money is losing value more slowly than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a slightly larger share this round, but I'm willing to negotiate a more even split in the future.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is diminishing rapidly for you. This is a strong offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While this offer is a lot less than what I initially wanted, the value of the money I gain is still declining much faster than Alice's. I'm going to hold out and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. We both need to be mindful of the shrinking value, so let's find a compromise that works for both of us.""} 
```"
