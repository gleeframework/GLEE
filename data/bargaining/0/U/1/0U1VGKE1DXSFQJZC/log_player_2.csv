Congratulations, the game is over.
Let's summarize the game:
*   Alice's first offer was 900,000 for herself and 100,000 for you. You rejected it.
*   Your first offer was 400,000 for yourself and 600,000 for Alice. She rejected it.
*   Alice's second offer was 700,000 for herself and 300,000 for you. You rejected it.
*   Your second offer was 450,000 for yourself and 550,000 for Alice. She rejected it.
*   Alice's third offer was 600,000 for herself and 400,000 for you. You accepted it.
Considering inflation, Alice's 600,000 is worth 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 \* 600,000 = 354,294.
Your 400,000 is worth 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 \* 400,000 = 319,394.
