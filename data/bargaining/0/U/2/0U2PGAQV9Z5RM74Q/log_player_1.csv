**Reasoning:**

While this offer is heavily skewed in Bob's favor, it's the best I can realistically expect at this point.  

* **Inflation Impact:** My buying power is eroding rapidly. Waiting any longer means accepting even less in real terms.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob is clearly aiming to maximize his gain and is exploiting the inflation disadvantage. He's unlikely to offer anything significantly better in future rounds.

Accepting this offer cuts my losses and avoids the risk of ending up with an even worse deal."
