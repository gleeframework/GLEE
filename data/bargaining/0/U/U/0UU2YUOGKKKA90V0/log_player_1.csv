"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid any risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is way too unfair. I'm going to reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still offering a significant amount to Bob in hopes of reaching an agreement before inflation takes too much of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfair, even with the inflation penalty. I'm going to reject and see if we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground. This offer gives Bob a decent portion, but still ensures I get a fair share before inflation continues to erode our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too lopsided. I'm going to reject and try to secure a better deal in the next round. The inflation is becoming a serious factor, but I'm not willing to settle for such an unfair split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to make another concession, but I'm getting concerned about how much inflation is impacting our potential gains.  I need to secure a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer, although the inflation is making it harder to hold out for a better deal. I'm going to reject and see if we can find a more balanced agreement. The clock is ticking, but I'm not ready to concede this much just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

We're running out of time, and inflation is a major concern now.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option left, and it's better than risking losing everything."
