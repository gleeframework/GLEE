"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to give Bob a 60/40 split. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too generous to you, Bob. I'll give you a chance to revise your offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in favor of Bob, I'll try to adjust my offer to be a bit more in my favor. I'll offer a 55/45 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4800, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take 4800. It's a decent deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer from round 4. The game is over!"
