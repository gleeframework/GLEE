"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both receive $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

Since the money is worth less in this round, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me $400,000 and Bob $600,000. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the money is worth even less in this round, I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and having the money worth even less.

I'll take the slightly better deal this time. {""decision"": ""accept""}"
