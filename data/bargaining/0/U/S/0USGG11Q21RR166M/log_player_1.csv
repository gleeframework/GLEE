Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly aggressive first offer, aiming to secure a large portion of the money while still leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, Bob's offer is still a significant improvement over getting nothing due to the time limit. It's important to be pragmatic and secure some gain, even if it's not ideal."
