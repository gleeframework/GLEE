Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be clever, but I'm not playing your game. Let's compromise: 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair split considering the inflation, and it avoids further losses. 
# Bob gain: 400000
