"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I should get a bit more too. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30% offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
