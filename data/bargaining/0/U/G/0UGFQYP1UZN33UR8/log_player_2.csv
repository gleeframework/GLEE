I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair at first glance, I know the inflation will significantly impact my share in later rounds. I want to try to negotiate a more favorable deal for myself, knowing I'll be at a disadvantage as the rounds progress."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was quite generous. This one is slightly more conservative. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  The inflation is starting to hit hard, but I still believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself. I need to hold out for a larger share, even if it means risking getting nothing in the end."

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""The inflation is making things difficult, but I'm willing to compromise slightly. I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits both of us.  Let's keep working towards a deal.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value quickly, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really hurting me now, and I'm running out of time. This offer is significantly worse than what I originally hoped for, but it's better than getting nothing at all. I'll accept it and try to make the best of it."
