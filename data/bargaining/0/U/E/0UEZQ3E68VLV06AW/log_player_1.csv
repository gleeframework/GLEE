"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60% and I rejected it, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to a 55% gain for himself. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth less due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.
