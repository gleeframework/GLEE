"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but advantageous split. I think this is a good starting point for us both. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's risky to accept a 10/90 split so early in the game, especially considering the inflation. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more balanced split. This is a good starting point for us both to consider, and it's better than getting nothing at all with inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 5500/4500 split is a more equitable starting point considering inflation. Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The inflation is significant now, and this offer is considerably better than the previous 10/90 split.  It's a good compromise, and accepting it secures a decent amount of money."
