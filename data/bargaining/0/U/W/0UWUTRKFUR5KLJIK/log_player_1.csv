"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering 70 dollars for myself and 30 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of Bob's offer, I'll consider it. My gain of 60 dollars is still the same as before, but Bob's gain of 40 dollars is worth 20% less than his original offer of 30 dollars. I'll decide to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 40, and my gain was 60, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping it's more appealing to Bob."
