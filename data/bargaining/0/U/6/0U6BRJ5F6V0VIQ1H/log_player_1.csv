"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose to take $90 and leave $10 for Bob.  This is a fair first offer, giving me a majority share but still allowing Bob a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While I'm getting less than I initially proposed, after inflation, this offer is better than the previous one. I don't want to risk another round and potentially get even less."
