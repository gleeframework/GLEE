"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. I know it's a bold move, but I figure he's likely to accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of getting nothing if he rejects and I take everything in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though I'm getting only $1, it's better than getting nothing in the next round. There's no guarantee I'll get anything if we continue, and the inflation factor makes the potential future gains less valuable."
