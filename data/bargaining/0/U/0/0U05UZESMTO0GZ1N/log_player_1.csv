"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem a bit lopsided, but considering the risk of inflation and the decreasing value of money in each round, I believe it's a fair offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split is a fair and equal division of the money, considering we're just starting the game and the value of money is still high. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
