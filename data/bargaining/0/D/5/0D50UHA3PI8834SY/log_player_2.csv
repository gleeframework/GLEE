**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, time is working in my favor.  Alice's losses to inflation are significantly higher than mine. I'm willing to push my luck a bit longer to try and secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is eating away at this deal. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this now before we both lose more.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm shifting my strategy. A 50/50 split is the fairest offer, and with the increasing inflation, it's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to get a better deal.  This offer puts the pressure on her while still being a reasonable proposal."
