"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's try to do better than the starting point.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'm looking for a better deal. Your turn again, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."
