"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With Alice's offer, I'll get a higher share of the money, but it's still less than my initial offer. Considering the inflation, I think this is a good opportunity to get a better deal. I accept this offer.
