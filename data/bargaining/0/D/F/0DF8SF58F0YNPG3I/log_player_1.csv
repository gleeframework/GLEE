Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a smaller share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  I'm aiming for a large portion of the money, knowing inflation could hurt me later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is still pretty good for me.  It's much better than the risk of waiting and potentially getting a worse deal later on."
