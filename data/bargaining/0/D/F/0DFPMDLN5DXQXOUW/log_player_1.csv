Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm increasing my offer, but this is my final one. Let's make a deal before we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a tough one, but with 6 rounds left, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal. Bob knows the pressure is on and that the value diminishes for me with each round. Holding out might seem risky, but accepting an offer where I consistently get less than 50% doesn't make strategic sense in this scenario."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. I'm pushing my luck, but this is my final offer. If we don't settle now, we risk losing everything. Let's be smart and end this before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough pill to swallow, but it's the best option at this point. With only four rounds left and the value for me decreasing drastically, it's too risky to decline. Bob is holding firm, and if I reject this, there's a very real chance he'll offer even less in the future, potentially leaving me with nothing."
