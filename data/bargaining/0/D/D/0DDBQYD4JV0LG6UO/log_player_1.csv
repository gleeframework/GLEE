Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm taking the risk of being the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is a good outcome.  The inflation means my share would be worth less if I rejected and continued the game, and there's no guarantee I could get a better offer."
