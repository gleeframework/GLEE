"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```
I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:
# Alice gain: 45
# Bob gain: 45

I accept this offer.
