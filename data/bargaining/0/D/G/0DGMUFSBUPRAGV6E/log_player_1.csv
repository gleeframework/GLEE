"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself slightly. This is a reasonable starting point, and I believe it gives Bob a good incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is unfair to me, especially given that I already made a generous proposal in the first round. I will not accept such an imbalance, and I am confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm willing to compromise further, but I still need a significant share to make this worthwhile with the inflation impacting my gains.  A 70/30 split seems like a fair balance, recognizing Bob's desire for a larger portion while still giving me a reasonable return."
