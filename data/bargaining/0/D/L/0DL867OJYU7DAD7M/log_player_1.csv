"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to get a better deal now that the money is worth even less. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This way, I'll get half of the remaining money, which is still a decent amount considering the inflation."
