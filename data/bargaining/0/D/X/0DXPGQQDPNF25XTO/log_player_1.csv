"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. The message ""Let's be fair"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer. Since it's the first round, I'm starting with a relatively balanced proposal to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get a more favorable split. Additionally, Bob's argument about inflation doesn't sway me since it affects his gain, not mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $57 and Bob receives $43. Given that the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and taking advantage of the inflation factor. The message aims to remind Bob that the value of the money is decreasing for him, making this offer relatively more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a deal before things get worse. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his claim that it's his final offer, I believe he's trying to create a sense of urgency to pressure me into accepting a deal that's less favorable to me. Given that the money is still worth the same to me, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to negotiate a better split. Additionally, Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation, so I'm not convinced that he'll be unwilling to make further concessions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you hard, reconsider your position""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. Given that the money is worth 27.1% less to Bob than in the first round, I'm trying to drive a harder bargain. The message aims to remind Bob that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for him, making it more sensible for him to accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation in subsequent rounds. By applying gentle pressure, I'm hoping to bring the negotiations to a close with a favorable outcome for myself."
