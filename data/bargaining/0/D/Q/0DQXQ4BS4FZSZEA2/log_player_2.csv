"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split close to even, but slightly in my favor since I'm taking the first risk. We can both avoid inflation this way. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd rather take my chances and try to get a better deal, even if it means risking some inflation. Alice's argument about taking the first risk doesn't convince me, and I think I can get a more even split. Bring on the next round!"

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll propose a more even split, taking into account the 5% inflation that just occurred. Since the money is now worth a bit less, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount to compensate.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5050, ""alice_gain"": 4950, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly, considering the first round's inflation. We can both still get a good deal.""}"
