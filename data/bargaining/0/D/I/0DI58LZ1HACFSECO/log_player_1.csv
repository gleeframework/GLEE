"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'd rather not give up more than I have to, so I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more advantageous offer this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to a 55-45 split. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Actually, I think I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going into the next round.
