"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. We both get a good amount, and we avoid the inflation penalty. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is fairer, considering the inflation penalty will be more significant for me than for you in the next rounds.  Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer is not valid anymore. I'll give you a bit more than before. Let's end this before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to hurt, and getting 4200 is better than risking getting nothing at all."
