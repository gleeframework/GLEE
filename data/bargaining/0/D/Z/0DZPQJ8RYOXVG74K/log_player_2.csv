While it seems like a bad deal for me right now, Alice is getting hit much harder by inflation. I'll hold out for a better offer."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to pull a fast one! While she claims to be generous, she's not factoring in the huge inflation hit she's taking. I need to hold out for a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. The inflation is hurting you much more than me. This is the most balanced offer you'll get.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is as good as it's going to get for me.  Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation, even if her offer is still slightly in her favor.  If I push further, I risk ending up with nothing."
