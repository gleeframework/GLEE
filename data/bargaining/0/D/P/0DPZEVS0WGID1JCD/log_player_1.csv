"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective value of the money. In this case, I'd be getting $450,000, which is equivalent to $450,000 / 0.95 = $473,684.21 in the first round's value.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease. To calculate the effective value of the money I'd get in Round 1, I'll divide the proposed amount by 0.854 (1 - 0.1426). 

$475,000 / 0.854 ≈ $556,033.29 in the first round's value.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 5, the money I gain is worth 19.53% less than in the first round. To calculate the effective value of the money I'd get in Round 1, I'll divide the amount I propose by 0.8053 (1 - 0.1953).

I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 625000,
  ""bob_gain"": 375000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 6, the money I gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease. To calculate the effective value of the money I'd get in Round 1, I'll divide the proposed amount by 0.7778 (1 - 0.2262).

$500,000 / 0.7778 ≈ $643,511.41 in the first round's value.

Since Bob is offering an equal split, which is a fair proposal, and considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll decide to accept this offer.
