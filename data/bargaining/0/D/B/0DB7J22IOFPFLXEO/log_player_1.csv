I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly. I'm taking a large share, but I want to avoid any potential inflation issues and get the money before it's worth less!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! While the offer is technically better for me than the previous round due to inflation, I'm going to reject it and hope to negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to try a more even split this time.  While the inflation hurts, I'm hoping Bob will realize that continuing to be so greedy could lead to both of us getting less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob seems to be getting greedier with each round. I'm going to keep rejecting his offers, as his greed is pushing us closer and closer to getting nothing at all!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm going to try to compromise a little, but still offer a split that is more equitable than Bob's. I hope he realizes that his greed is hurting us both, and that a more balanced approach is necessary to ensure we both get something."
