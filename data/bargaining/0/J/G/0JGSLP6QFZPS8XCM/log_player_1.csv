"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% of the initial amount, and you get 20%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous for you, Bob. I'll need a bigger share to make it worth my while. Let's try again!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and looking for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to a 50/50 split. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are adding up!

Considering the money is worth significantly less for me now, I'll have to be more cautious. However, a 50/50 split sounds like a good compromise, especially since the money is worth less for both of us.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob! Let's split it 50/50. I think we can both live with that.""
}
```"
