"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight edge to start, but I'm willing to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly. If Bob's offer is 40, that's equivalent to 42 in the first round.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, I'll propose a slightly higher gain for myself to account for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm still looking for a fair split!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger risk, but I think I deserve more this round! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the offer, I'll have to adjust for the 14.26% decrease in value. If Bob's offer is 30, that's equivalent to 34.65 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll propose a gain that's slightly higher than the equivalent of 30 in the first round.

  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much!""
