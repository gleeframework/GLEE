"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair-ish split. I'll take the larger share, but you still get something. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's better to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll see what she proposes next round, keeping in mind that inflation will make her offer less attractive."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer.  This way we both get a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our earnings.""}
