"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to settle for $5,000."
