Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to try and get a good deal on the first round, since the money is worth the same for both of us right now. I'll offer Bob 10 dollars, and keep the remaining 90 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer more, the money is worth the same for me in this round. It's better to take a 50/50 split than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
