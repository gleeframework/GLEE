Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. This ensures a fair outcome for both of us, despite the diminishing value of money for me. It's in our best interest to reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
