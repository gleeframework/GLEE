400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the inflation we both face, even though yours is more significant.  Let's close this deal.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's be practical. Your offer doesn't reflect the urgency of inflation for me. This revised offer is fair and lets us both walk away with a decent sum.",Alice,3,
