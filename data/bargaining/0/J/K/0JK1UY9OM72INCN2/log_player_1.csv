I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  Since I'm the one making the first offer, I'm taking a bigger share."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While the inflation is hitting me hard, I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round. I believe I have a good chance of getting closer to a 50/50 split, especially considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob."
