"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 
 
I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we both have equal chances to propose in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, even considering the inflation. I'm confident I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'll adjust my offer slightly. Since Bob seems to want a larger share, I'm willing to reduce my gain to 55, but still maintaining a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my gain. I am still confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

Given the current inflation, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest option. It's a compromise that acknowledges the changing value of the money while still being a reasonable outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is increasingly unfavorable due to the accelerating inflation. While his share is getting bigger, the value of my share is dropping dramatically. I still believe I can negotiate a better deal, even though the remaining rounds are limited."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

While inflation is hurting me significantly, I need to make a move to secure some of the value. I'm willing to concede more to Bob, but not to the extent he's asking for. A 45/55 split is a compromise that acknowledges the changing circumstances and still leaves a reasonable share for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's share continues to increase, my share is shrinking dramatically due to inflation.  Even though the game is nearing its end, I still believe a better outcome is possible."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I need to make a decisive move.  With only a few rounds left, I'm willing to concede more to Bob to ensure a share of the remaining value. A 40/60 split offers a compromise that acknowledges the inflation and the limited time remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable.  Even though the value of my share is significantly reduced, I am not willing to accept such a small portion of the remaining money. I will continue to try and negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

With only two rounds left, time is running out. I am willing to compromise further to secure a share of the remaining value. I will propose a 35/65 split, hoping Bob will recognize that this is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one.  While Bob's offer is terrible in terms of the original value of the money, the inflation has made the situation dire. Accepting this offer, though unpleasant, at least guarantees me some return.  Rejecting means both of us get nothing.  It's time to take what I can get."
