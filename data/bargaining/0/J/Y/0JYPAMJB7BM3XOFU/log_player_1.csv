"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'm now worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the actual amount I'd gain from Bob's offer is $4000 * 0.95 = $3800.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but it's an improvement over the initial offer. I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiations and get some money.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
