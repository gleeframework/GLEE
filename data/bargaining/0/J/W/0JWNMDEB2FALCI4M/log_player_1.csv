Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation on my end, I need a division that reflects the current value of the money for me. This offer is more favorable than your initial proposal but still aims for a fair split under the current circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
