"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to get Bob to agree quickly and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can do better. I will reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but still keep it relatively generous. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers could lead to a worse outcome for him, especially as inflation continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While the inflation is starting to bite, I'm hoping that Bob will come to a more equitable agreement if I continue to hold firm."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to continue to reduce my offer, but I'm still holding out for a larger share. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even though inflation is making the money worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is becoming a real problem, but I'm still going to reject this offer. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation, and I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'm hoping that he'll realize that he needs to offer me a better deal if he wants to get anything at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is getting serious, and I need to start making concessions. This is a 50/50 split, which is fair given the circumstances.  I hope Bob realizes that further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better outcome for either of us."
