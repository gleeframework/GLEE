"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose a 99/1 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to maximize my share, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to get the game started.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and with each round, the value of the money I get decreases. It's better to take the 50 now and avoid the risk of getting nothing later!"
