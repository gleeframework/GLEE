"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's see if you can do better!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm curious to see if Bob can do better."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal than 30% of the $100, so I'll reject this offer and make a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even distribution of the $100. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
