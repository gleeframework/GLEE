Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. I'll give you 10% of the total. If you don't like it, I can offer you more in the next round.""
}
```

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $380,000.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:
