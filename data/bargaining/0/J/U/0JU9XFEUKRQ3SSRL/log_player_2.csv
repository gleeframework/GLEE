Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know my share is decreasing, but I'm not desperate yet. This is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, while not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Pie:** The value of the total pot is decreasing rapidly for both players. While Bob is losing value at a slower rate, waiting any longer will only result in smaller gains for both sides. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has labeled this as her ""final compromise."" This suggests she's unlikely to offer more favorable terms in subsequent rounds. Rejecting this offer risks her becoming more entrenched and offering even less favorable splits in the future.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could reject hoping for a better deal in the next round, the potential gain is minimal compared to the potential loss if Alice further reduces her offer.

While $4400 is less than Bob's initial target, accepting now secures a reasonable sum considering the circumstances and avoids the risk of walking away with even less."
