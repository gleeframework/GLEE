"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more as I'm starting the negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer, Alice. Let's both get a good chunk of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be greedy Bob, the clock is ticking. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, with the clock ticking and the money losing value, it's better to secure at least something rather than risk getting nothing."
