Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split seems fair in the long run, but my value for the money decreases with every round. How about we try 60/40? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
