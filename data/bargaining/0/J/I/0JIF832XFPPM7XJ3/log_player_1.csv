"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and giving Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I need to consider the adjusted values.

My gain would be $50, which is worth 95% of the original $60, and Bob's gain would be $50, which is worth 80% of the original $40.

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split.
