# Alice's message: Let's get this over with quickly. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a little something to keep you happy.

# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 1000$ is something, it's a very small amount. I'd rather try to negotiate for a bigger share."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While 100,000 is a significant increase from the first offer, I'm still losing a huge amount of money. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
