"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the low offer, it's still worth something 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial proposal, I'm tempted to reject it. However, the message ""Take the low offer, it's still worth something"" makes me think that Bob might be trying to be reasonable.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite low, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to get a better share. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more""}

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm hoping that Bob will be more willing to accept this offer since it's still a decent share for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We can still split it down the middle, but with a bit more for me this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm surprised that Bob is still trying to split it down the middle, considering his previous offers were much lower. Since I'm not getting any younger and the money is devaluing rapidly, I think it's time to be more realistic.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
