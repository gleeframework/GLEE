"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, but I'm open to negotiations.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take into account the potential for inflation.  Let's split it 60/40 this round, with me getting the larger share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather not accept Bob's offer. The money I'd gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so $4,000 is actually worth $3,200 in terms of purchasing power. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value (80% of 50% of the original value), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a larger share this round, but I'm open to negotiations.""
}
```"
