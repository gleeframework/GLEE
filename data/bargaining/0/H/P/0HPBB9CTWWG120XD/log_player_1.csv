"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this is a compromise considering the inflation.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts you more than me. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further inflation.  Bob's offer is now equal to what I offered him in Round 1, and the longer we wait, the less favorable the outcome for me."
