Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the potential for inflation. Let's see what you think.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation is hitting you harder.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to secure a majority share to make it worth my while.  Let's split it 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tricky situation, but accepting is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for you. Waiting any longer dramatically reduces your potential gain.
* **Bob's Concessions:** While Bob is being tough, he has moved slightly in your favor. Accepting avoids the risk of him becoming even more demanding. 
* **Something is Better than Nothing:**  Holding out for a better deal is risky. If you reach round 12 without an agreement, you both get nothing.

While not ideal, accepting secures a reasonable sum considering the circumstances."
