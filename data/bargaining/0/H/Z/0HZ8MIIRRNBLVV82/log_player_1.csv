"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer ensures the most possible money for me in this round. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, there's no way to predict his response. He might accept it, hoping for a better deal in the future, or he might reject it hoping for a more generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is heavily in his favor, I'm going to reject it. I know that the inflation is affecting him, so I have a chance to get a better deal in the next round.  I'm gambling on his desire to reach a deal before the inflation eats away at his gains even further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly more generous deal than before. I'm hoping that he'll see that this is a much better deal than his last offer, especially considering the continued inflation. Since I don't know the exact impact of inflation on Bob, I'm aiming for a compromise that leaves some room for negotiation."
