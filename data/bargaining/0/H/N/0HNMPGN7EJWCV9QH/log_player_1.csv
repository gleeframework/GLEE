Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a bold move, but I figure it's best to try and secure a good chunk of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, 80% is still a decent share, especially considering the inflation.  It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing."
