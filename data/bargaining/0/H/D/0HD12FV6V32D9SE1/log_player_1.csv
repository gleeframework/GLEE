I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob. I want to see if he'll accept a quick deal, or if he's more interested in trying to get a bigger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more, this is a fair split and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
