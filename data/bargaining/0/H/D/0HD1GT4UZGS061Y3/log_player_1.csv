Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It accounts for the risk I'm taking by letting this pot shrink. Don't be greedy, accept and let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
