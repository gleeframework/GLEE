"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a very aggressive opening offer, but given the high inflation rate for Bob, it's worth a shot.  I want to see if I can get a quick agreement and avoid losing any money to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 500,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm not losing anything to inflation this round, so I can afford to be a bit more demanding."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to account for the risk of Bob accepting a lower offer later on. However, I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 625000 
# Bob gain: 375000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired amount, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal. I'm not losing any money to inflation this round, and Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor due to the inflation affecting him. I'm going to hold out for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly. Bob's offers are starting to become more tempting, but I'm still confident that I can secure a larger share."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob's offer is getting closer, but the inflation is really starting to hurt him. I think I can push for an even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. Bob is losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, and I think he might be willing to accept this offer to avoid losing even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 775000 
# Bob gain: 225000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly appealing.  Inflation is taking a heavy toll on him, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. While I'd like to push for a larger share, I'm  accepting this offer to avoid risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
