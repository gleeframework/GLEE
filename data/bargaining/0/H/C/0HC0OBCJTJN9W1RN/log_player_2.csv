"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good deal for you to accept early before inflation eats away at our money. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject the offer. While it's a good starting point, I think I can get a better deal if we go through a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more evenly. I'm offering 55 for me and 45 for you. It's a fair deal, and it saves us from further inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer in the last round, but it's still better for me to get the larger share. I'll take 55, leaving you with 45.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept the offer.  It's not my ideal split, but the inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk losing even more."
