"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a significant share of the money while still offering Bob something. I hope this will be enough to entice him to accept and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, I believe I can still do better. Inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, so I need to push for a more favorable deal. I'll counter-propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm offering a compromise by increasing my share slightly from the previous round, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion. This offer is more balanced, accounting for the inflation that affects me more than Bob. I hope this will be enough to secure a deal and avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has significantly affected the value of the money I'd gain, and Bob's offer, while not ideal, is the best I can reasonably expect at this point.  Accepting avoids further risk of losing even more value."
