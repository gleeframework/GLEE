"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70% and you take 30%""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the $1,000,000 and leave 30% for Bob. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a small share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less, so $200,000 is now worth $160,000.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not risk going to Round 3 with even less valuable money. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
