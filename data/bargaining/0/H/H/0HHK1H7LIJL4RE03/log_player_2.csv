Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your loss is my gain, literally. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing aggressively, knowing that inflation works in her favor. While the offer is getting worse, I need to show her I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would set a bad precedent and likely lead to even worse offers in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time. I'll accept your offer from Round 1.""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. Inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and Alice is unlikely to budge much further than her previous offers. Accepting a 45/55 split now, while not ideal, is better than risking even lower offers in later rounds or getting nothing at all.  It's a compromise to secure a reasonable amount, even if it's not the perfect outcome."
