"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent cut. Accept this and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer is tempting, it's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further.  There's a lot of money at stake, and it's worth seeing if we can get a better deal for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
