"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal and minimize the impact of inflation on my share.  Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much better for him than my initial proposal, but I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change in the distribution. I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round, as I will be making the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more appealing to Bob while still securing a significant share for myself. Given the inflation, I'm hoping this offer will be more attractive to him, leading to a quicker resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my preferred share, but I'm still not happy with the distribution. The inflation is hurting Bob more than me, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my desired share slightly again, hoping to find a compromise that Bob will accept. The inflation is starting to affect his share significantly, making it more likely he'll want to settle."
