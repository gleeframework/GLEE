I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a pretty generous offer considering I have the advantage of knowing about the inflation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I initially wanted to keep a larger share, the inflation factor has significantly decreased the value of my potential gains. A 50/50 split is still a good outcome for me, especially considering the shrinking value of the money."
