I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this in the first round.  Even though he gets less, it's better than nothing!  Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to accept this offer.  In the next round, I only get 90% of the 5000, which is 4500, and my chance of getting a better deal is slim.  Accepting now is the best way to secure some money."
