"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is a risky strategy, as it prioritizes Alice's potential gain over fairness. If Bob accepts, Alice will receive a large share. However, if Bob rejects, the next round will see Alice's potential share reduced by 20% due to inflation. This strategy hinges on Bob being cooperative or valuing a smaller share over playing for a larger potential gain in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good time to accept. While it's not the best deal Alice could have hoped for, the potential losses from continued rejection are high. Bob's offer, while not generous, is a fair division considering the inflation effects. It's important to weigh the potential gain from playing further against the risk of losing more money due to inflation."
