"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (900,000$) while still leaving a reasonable amount (100,000$) for Bob. Since it's the first round, I want to establish a strong initial position, but not be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting the offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is now offering me a much smaller share (100,000$) while taking the majority for himself. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 700,000, but still maintaining a substantial lead. Bob seems to be getting more aggressive, so I want to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significant decrease in my own share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is now offering me even less (300,000$) while increasing his own share. Although inflation is becoming a serious factor, I'm still not ready to settle for such a small amount.  I'll reject this offer and try to improve my position in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

Inflation is getting serious, and I need to compromise. I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is fair considering the inflation impact and shows I'm willing to cooperate.  Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation."
