"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but that's a bit too low for me. How about a 45/55 split? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
