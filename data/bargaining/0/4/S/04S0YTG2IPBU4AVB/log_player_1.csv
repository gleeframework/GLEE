I propose to take 9000$ and give Bob 1000$.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer since he has a lot to gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

I'm going to stick with my original offer. While Bob's offer might seem tempting at first, I think it's risky to keep rejecting. Inflation is a factor, and it's unclear how it's affecting him. I'm hoping he'll realize that accepting my offer is the safest option."
