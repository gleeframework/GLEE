"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

This offer gives Alice a large share, but ensures Bob gets something.  It's a good starting point, but I'm curious to see if Bob will accept or counter-propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, even after accounting for inflation.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a deal that gives me less than 50% of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority share, but this offer is closer to Bob's last proposal. It also accounts for inflation. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob."
