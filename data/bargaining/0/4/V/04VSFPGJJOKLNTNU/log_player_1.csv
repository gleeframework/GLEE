Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a fair deal, but my turn comes with risks due to inflation.  Let's make this work. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6400,
""bob_gain"": 3600,
""message"": ""Bob, my previous offer was more than fair. This is your second warning - inflation is eating away at your potential gains.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it, but the pot is getting smaller for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, and his offer is getting better. However, I'm willing to bet he'll be even more desperate in the next few rounds. The 50/50 split is tempting, but I can still push for a slight advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Take it, or we both lose big in the long run. Inflation waits for no one.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right about inflation hurting us both. I'm meeting you closer to your terms hoping you'll be reasonable. This is a loss for me already. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** This offer is still in my favor, and Bob is clearly feeling the heat. If I push further, he might become completely unreasonable, and we risk walking away with nothing. It's better to secure a win now than risk a significant loss later."
