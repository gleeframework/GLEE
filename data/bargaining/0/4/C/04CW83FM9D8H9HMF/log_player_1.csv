"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20 to start, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 80/20 in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation.

The offer from Bob is to split the money 50/50, which is a reasonable compromise. However, considering the inflation, the $5,000 I would gain is actually worth 95% of what I would have gained in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
