{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, I'll take the majority share""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a majority share, but I'm willing to give you a smaller portion than you asked for. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping to get at least 50% of the money, and 20% is too low for me. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal share""}

I'm proposing that we split the $100 equally, with each of us getting 50%. I think this is a reasonable and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
