"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to start, but don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly, no tricks! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts I would get in this offer are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16
* Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56

I'm not sure I like the fact that Bob gets more than me, even though the offer is supposed to be an even split. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob! I'll take a bit more this time, but don't think you're getting off easy!""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but don't think you're getting it all! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I would get in this offer, considering the inflation:

* My gain: 7000 / 0.8526 = 8189.23 (14.26% less than the original $10,000)
* Bob's gain: 3000 / 0.7279 = 4117.45 (27.1% less than the original $10,000)

I'm not sure I like the fact that I'm still getting less than Bob, and the message is a bit condescending. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give you all the power. Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a more balanced split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
