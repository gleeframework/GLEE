"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. I'm hoping he'll accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, this time with a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

I'll have to reject this offer since it's not significantly better than my original offer, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and considering Bob's last offer, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth only 72.9% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a decent compromise, but I'm still not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I won't regret it later.
