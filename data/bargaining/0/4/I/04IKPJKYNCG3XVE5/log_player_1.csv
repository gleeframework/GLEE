"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to see if he'll take it, knowing that his money is worth less in each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and Bob's money is losing value faster.  It's in my best interest to accept."
