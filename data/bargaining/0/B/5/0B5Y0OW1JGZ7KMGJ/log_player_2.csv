"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice rejected the 50-50 split, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer a slightly biased split in my favor, considering the inflation risk.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take the offer, considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money I'd gain in future rounds. The 45$ I'll get in this round is still worth more than what I'd get in future rounds, so I'll accept.
