"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving up too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving Bob 4,000$ and keeping 6,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is in order. Let's both get a little closer to half. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has taken a bite out of my potential earnings.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 5,500$ just yet, especially since the money I gain is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more to make up for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving Bob 4,500$ and keeping 5,500$ for myself."
