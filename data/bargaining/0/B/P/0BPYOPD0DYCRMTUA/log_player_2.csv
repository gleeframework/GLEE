Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We're both losing value with each round, so a 50/50 split is the most logical way to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
