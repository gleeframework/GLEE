"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000. I think it's a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me at least something.  The inflation is making it risky to keep rejecting, and a 50/50 split is reasonable given the circumstances."
