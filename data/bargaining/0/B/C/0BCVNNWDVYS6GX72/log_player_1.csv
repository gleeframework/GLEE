Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, leaving a small amount for Bob. It's a risky move, but I want to see if he'll accept it right away.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred more, this offer is still a significant gain.  It's better to secure a large sum now than risk losing even more to inflation."
