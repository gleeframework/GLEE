"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more equitable, considering we both have a chance to propose. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the risks!""
}
```

I'm offering a 52-48 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
