"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000$ is worth 4000 * 0.9 = 3600$.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is still getting the larger share, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

For now, I'll reject the offer:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to be generous""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give in too easily 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 3500$ is worth 3500 * 0.727 = 2545.5$.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is still getting the larger share, I'll think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

However, I notice that the difference between our shares is increasing, and I'm not getting a better deal. I'll reject the offer:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 3000$ is worth 3000 * 0.5915 = 1774.5$.

I'm getting a bit desperate too, but I'm not sure if this is the best I can get. I'll think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

However, I notice that the difference between our shares is still quite large, and I'm not getting a better deal. I'll reject the offer:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"

  ""message"": ""I'm not going to back down, I want a bigger share""
