"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This offer is designed to maximize my potential gain, even with the inflation risk. I'm betting that Bob will be tempted to accept a small amount rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation risk is too great to ignore.  A guaranteed 500,000 is much better than potentially getting nothing in the later rounds."
