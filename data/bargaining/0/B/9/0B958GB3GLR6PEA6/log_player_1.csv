"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get a good amount this way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more, considering the money is worth less now.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to get a bit more than 50% of the remaining money, considering the value of the money has decreased."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk of inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 60% to me and 40% to Bob, hoping to get a bit more than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think 5500/4500 is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money continues to decrease. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise. Can you meet me in the middle at 5200/4800?""
}

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think this is a fair split considering the value of the money is dropping.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 55% to me and 45% to Bob, trying to get a bit more than before, but still being mindful of the decreasing value of the money."
