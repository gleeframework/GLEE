"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a generous offer given the potential for inflation in future rounds.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting this deal and we can both walk away with a significant sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, especially considering the inflation that has occurred.  I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering Bob's previous offer and the ongoing inflation.  I believe this offer is still beneficial for both of us and allows us to avoid further rounds where the value of our gains could decrease even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer isn't as favorable as my previous ones, considering the significant inflation, it's the best I can hope for at this point. Accepting ensures I receive a substantial amount, and further rounds would only result in a smaller payout."
