Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80% of the remaining 100$ to ensure a strong foundation for future rounds, but I'm willing to compromise and give you 20%. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80
