Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share this time.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further rounds and the risks of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
