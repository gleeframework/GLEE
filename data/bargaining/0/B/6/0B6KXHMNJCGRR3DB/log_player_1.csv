"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $40 is actually worth $32.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed towards you, can you offer a bit more?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer is now worth $32.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not sure if it's fair""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard! My gain of $35 is actually worth only $17.60 now.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, I still want to try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too skewed towards you, I'm not sure if I can afford to be generous""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my offer is now worth even less. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my offer is now worth $5.12 (40% of $12.80).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I'm not sure if it's worth it""
}
```"
