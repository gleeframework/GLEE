"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to start with, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total amount, which is $2,000. I'll keep $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a strong start, let's see if you'll accept a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are rising!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is a significant concession from his initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the inflation, the $5,000 I'd gain is actually worth $4,750 in real terms.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to give up 50% of the money yet. Let's see if we can do better.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is eating away at the value of the money, so I need to be strategic about my next offer. Considering the 5% decrease in value, my goal is to get as much as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a decent chunk for myself. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the total amount. I'll keep $6,000 for myself, which is worth $5,700 in real terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you a smaller chunk to get us closer to a deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Considering the 14.26% decrease in value, the $3,000 I'd gain is actually worth $2,571 in real terms. That's not a great deal for me.

However, I don't want to give up too much more, and Bob's offer is a significant concession from his previous one. I'll think carefully about it...

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving up that much more. Let's see if we can find a better balance.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I need to be strategic about my next offer.

Considering the 14.26% decrease in value, I'll aim for a smaller amount to maintain some bargaining power. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to keep some value for myself. Let's see if we can find a deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500, which is 55% of the total amount. I'll keep $4,500 for myself, which is worth $3,858 in real terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a strong stance now, I need a significant share to make this deal worthwhile for me 
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Considering the 22.62% decrease in value, the $1,500 I'd gain is actually worth $1,163 in real terms. That's not a great deal for me.

However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we can't reach a deal. Bob's offer is a significant concession from his previous one, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept the offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'm accepting your offer, but I'm not happy about it. I hope this is the best I can get.""
