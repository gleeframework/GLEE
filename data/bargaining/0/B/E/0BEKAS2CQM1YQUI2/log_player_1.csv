"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money has decreased, so the offer is not as appealing as it seems.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on a slightly higher share for me, considering the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I still want to keep a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, the value of the money has decreased significantly. However, Bob's offer is still a bit more favorable to him than my previous offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like I'll be taking home $5200!"
