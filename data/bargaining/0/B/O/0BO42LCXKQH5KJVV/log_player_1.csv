"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'd rather get a larger share now than a smaller share later. I'll accept this offer.
