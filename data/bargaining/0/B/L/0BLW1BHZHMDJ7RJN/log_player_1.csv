"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more equitable split.  Let's talk. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is essentially the same as my initial offer, just with the labels flipped. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round, and another 20% less after the second round, the total value of the money is now 60% of its original value. I'll try to take advantage of this by offering a smaller share to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better deal anywhere else, Bob!""
}
```"
