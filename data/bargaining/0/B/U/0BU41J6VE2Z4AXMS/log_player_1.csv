"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the money and give Bob 10%. I'm hoping this will set a good tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split, your turn next! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'm looking at a gain of 7200 dollars (9000 * 0.8) instead of 9000.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since my gain is now 6000, which is less than 7200, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 0.8), so I'm looking at a gain of 5760 dollars (7200 * 0.8).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money and give Bob 45%. I hope this is more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, it's worth a shot! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8%), so I'm looking at a gain of 5120 dollars (10000 * 0.0512) instead of 7200.

However, Bob's offer is for a 50/50 split, which means I would get 5000 dollars, which is more than my current gain. I'll accept this offer.
