"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. This way, I'll get $80, and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my initial gain of $80 is now worth $64.

Bob's offer of 50/50 is a good one, but I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain of $64 is now worth $51.20 (80% of $64).

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less each round, and this is the 4th round, the money is worth 80% of the original value, then 64% of the original value, then 51.2% of the original value, and now 51.2% x 80% = 40.96% of the original value.

My gain of $55 is now worth $43.93 (40.96% of $55).

Bob's offer of 40/60 is a good one, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 48.8% of the original value, my gain of $43.93 is now worth $21.35 (48.8% of $43.93).
