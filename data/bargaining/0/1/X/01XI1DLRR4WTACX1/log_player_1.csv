I'm proposing a 900,000$ to 100,000$ split in my favor. Let's see if Bob thinks it's fair!"

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm proposing a 600,000$ to 400,000$ split in my favor.  It's a bit less than my initial offer, but inflation is biting, and I want to secure a deal before it gets worse!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is slightly worse for me than my last proposal, but with inflation hitting hard, I need to secure a deal before things get even worse. I'm accepting Bob's offer."
