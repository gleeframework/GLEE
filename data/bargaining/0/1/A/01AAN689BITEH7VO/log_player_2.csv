"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous, split for me. I'm confident we can find a better outcome for both of us in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal right off the bat. Let's see what Alice is willing to do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference and start with a more even distribution. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and we can both benefit from finding a more favorable solution for both of us in the future rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try a more balanced approach. This offer reflects a compromise, and I believe it's a better starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer ensures I get a decent share.  The inflation is a real threat, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
