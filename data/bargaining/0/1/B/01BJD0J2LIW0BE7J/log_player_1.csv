Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but let's be realistic and split this evenly. This is our best chance to both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### \n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I would only get $4500 in value from the original $10,000 if I accept this offer. Given that I initially proposed a 55% share for myself, accepting 50% now would mean I'm compromising too much, too quickly, especially considering the difference in how inflation affects us. I'll reject this offer to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, hoping that the threat of further inflation might make Bob more willing to compromise in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### \n\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair adjustment.""}\n\n### \n\nReasoning: In this round, the money is worth even less due to inflation. Since Bob is affected more by inflation (20% decrease in value for him), and considering my initial offer was already leaning in my favor, I'll adjust my proposal to take a larger share, 60%, while still leaving Bob with a significant amount. The message aims to justify this adjustment based on the impact of inflation, framing it as a fair adaptation to the changing circumstances. This approach tests Bob's willingness to accept a less favorable deal due to the increasing pressure from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. Take this offer or I'm walking away in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\nReasoning: At this point, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less. Given the significant decrease in value for both of us, but especially for Bob, his offer to split the money with me getting $5500 and him getting $4500 is relatively reasonable considering the circumstances. Since Bob has threatened to walk away in the next round, and given the rapidly diminishing value of the money, accepting this offer now ensures I get a known quantity rather than risking further loss of value or even getting nothing if Bob follows through on his threat. This decision prioritizes securing a tangible gain over the possibility of negotiating a marginally better deal in a future round."
