"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not sure that's a fair split. I think I can do better.  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation we'll face in later rounds.  Let's get this done.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable given the inflation we're both experiencing.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy considering the inflation and Alice's willingness to compromise.  It's a reasonable split, and it avoids the risk of further rounds and potentially even worse outcomes for both of us."
