"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it down the middle!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This seems like a fair and reasonable split to me!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm being generous! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With the offer, I'd get $2,500, which is less than my initial proposal of $6,000. On the other hand, Bob is getting a significant chunk of the money, $7,500.

After considering the offer, I decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal!

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more for myself""}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm making a serious offer now! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the offer, I'd get $4,500, which is a significant decrease from my initial proposal of $8,000. However, Bob is still getting a decent chunk of the money, $5,500.

After weighing the options, I decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to think strategically!

{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk, but I want a bigger share""}

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets only $1,000. I'm taking a risk by giving Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in having a bigger chunk of the pie for himself.

Let's see if Bob will take the bait!"
