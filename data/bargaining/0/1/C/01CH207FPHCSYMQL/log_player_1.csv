"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This way, we both get a significant amount of money to start with, and we can reassess our offers in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's aim for a better split! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the new proposal, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to get a higher share of the money, especially considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. I'll wait for his next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% decrease in the value of money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I need a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the new proposal, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he's given me a slightly higher amount, I still think I deserve a larger share, especially considering the significant decrease in the value of money due to inflation. I'll wait for his next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 60.8% decrease in the value of money since the first round:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I need to make sure I'm not getting left with nothing!""
}
```

I'm proposing a revised split, with me getting $4,000 and Bob getting $6,000."
