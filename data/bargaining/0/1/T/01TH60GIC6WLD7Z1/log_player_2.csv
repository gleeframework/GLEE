"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this started, Bob! I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm not going to give away too much. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to take the $400,000, but we need to consider the inflation. Even if Alice keeps making the same offer, it will be worth less to me with each passing round. I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is offering the same deal I proposed in the last round, and I'm not sure if she's aware of the inflation. This seems like a fair compromise, and with the inflation, I don't want to risk getting less."
