"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, Bob! I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual value of my gain in Round 2 is 95% of what it was in Round 1, so my gain would be 570,000 (0.95 * 600,000).

Since Bob's offer is a 55-45 split, and I'm not getting as much as I would have liked in the first round, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the actual value of the money is now 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of what it was in the first round. So, the effective value of the money in Round 3 is approximately 902,500.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""
}
