"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 700000 for me and 300000 for you. Let me know if you agree. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer is tempting, there's no guarantee that Alice will offer anything better in the future.  It's worth risking a round to see if I can get a better deal.  Plus, inflation might work in my favor!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
