"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split in this round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round costs us money due to inflation. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
* **Predicting Bob:**  Bob's offer in Round 2 suggests he's aiming for a larger share. My offer is a compromise, but it's firm. 
* **The Brink:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to signal to Bob that I'm serious and won't accept a bad deal in a future round.  This increases the pressure on him to accept."
