"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total, and I'll take the rest. This way, we both get something and can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm framing this as a fair starting point to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60% now, let's see if you're willing to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money I gain is worth 10% less, so I'll receive $6,000 (which is 10% less than $6,667, the 60% of $10,000 that Bob offered).

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
