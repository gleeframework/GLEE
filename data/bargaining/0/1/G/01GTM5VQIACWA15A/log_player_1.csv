Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I want to keep some for myself. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob is offering me a bigger share, I'm tempted to accept. However, I'm not sure if it's the best deal. Considering the inflation, my gain of $70 is actually worth $63 (10% less than the initial $80 I would have gotten in the first round). Bob's gain of $30 is actually worth $24 (20% less than the initial $40 he would have gotten in the first round).

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50, no more negotiations!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which means I'll get $50 and Bob will get $50."
