Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds go on and the value of her potential winnings decreases. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I believe I can still get a better deal by holding out a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time is running out! A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push for a more agreeable solution. A 50/50 split is fair and straightforward, and it avoids the risk of running out of rounds and getting nothing. Alice is likely feeling the pressure of the decreasing value and will hopefully see this as a reasonable compromise."
