"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. Even with the 10% inflation, I'm still getting a significantly lower amount than my initial proposal. I'll risk another round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a compromise, considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer. Hopefully, he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money, this offer is still better than my previous proposal. I'm accepting it to avoid further risk and potential losses due to inflation."
