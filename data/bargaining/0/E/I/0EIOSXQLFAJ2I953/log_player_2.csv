Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This offer is a good compromise - let's be sensible and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth is pointless. We both lose with every passing round. I'm making a final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate, which means my position is getting stronger.  Even with the increased inflation, holding out for one more round is worth the risk. If she's serious about a ""final offer,"" she'll have to make it much more appealing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's settle this. Time is money, and we've both lost enough already.  This is my final offer. Take it and we both walk away with something substantial.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm serious. This is it. Accept this offer, or we both walk away with nothing. Don't let greed cloud your judgment. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The game has reached a critical point. Alice is clearly drawing a hard line, and while the offer isn't ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this stage. The impact of inflation is becoming severe, and waiting another round carries a significant risk of ending up with nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees a payout, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
