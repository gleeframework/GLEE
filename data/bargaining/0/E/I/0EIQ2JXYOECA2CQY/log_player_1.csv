"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose to keep almost all the money, leaving just $1 for Bob. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I hope Bob will accept it, but I'm prepared for him to reject it and propose a fairer split in the next round. However, if he does reject, I know that the money will be worth less to him in the next round, and I can offer him a bit more to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. It's clear that he's trying to take advantage of the inflation and offer me a minimal amount.  While the money is worth less to me in this round, I believe I can still get a better deal by proposing a more balanced split in the next round. I'm confident that Bob will eventually realize that it's in his best interest to negotiate fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. After Bob's unreasonable offer, I believe a fair and equal split is the best way to reach an agreement. While the inflation has affected the value of the money, I believe it's important to maintain a sense of fairness and collaboration. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of a mutually beneficial outcome and accept this offer."
