"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm offering Bob a significant portion of the money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's share, I'll have to be more cautious. My gain is still 5000, which is still a good amount. But Bob's gain is now only 4000 in terms of purchasing power. I'll accept this offer to get a guaranteed 5000.
