```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer, since it's not favorable to me. I'd rather wait for a better proposal.
