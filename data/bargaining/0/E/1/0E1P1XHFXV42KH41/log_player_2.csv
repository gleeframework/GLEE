Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is still on my side. Inflation is eroding her potential gains faster than mine.  I'll hold out for a better offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Time is money Alice, literally! This is a very fair offer.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise, but I'm keeping the pressure on Alice. The longer this goes on, the more she stands to lose due to inflation."
