"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\nI am offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob. I believe this is a reasonable and fair split, considering we are starting the negotiations. I am open to adjustments but believe this offer sets a good foundation for our discussion.\n\n###\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you value fairness, but this is a one-time offer. Let's settle for a more realistic split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money has decreased for me due to inflation, I believe that accepting $4500, which is now worth even less than its face value, is not in my best interest. I am willing to negotiate further to reach a more favorable agreement.\n\n###\nLet's proceed to the next round where I will make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is the best I can offer""}\n\n###\nI am offering $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob. Given that the value of the money has decreased by 20% for me in the second round and will decrease further, I am trying to balance between getting a fair share and accounting for the diminishing value of the money. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while also being mindful of the inflation's impact on my gains.\n\n###\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  Accept this offer, and we both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI accept Bob's offer. Given that the value of the money has decreased significantly for me due to inflation, and considering that further rounds will only diminish my potential gains, I believe accepting $4900, despite its reduced value, is the most pragmatic decision at this point. Continuing negotiations may lead to an even less favorable outcome for me, so I am willing to settle with this offer.\n\n###\nLet's conclude the game here."
