"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to turn the tables!

Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'll calculate my gain as follows:

400,000 / 0.95 = 42105.26

Not a bad offer, but I'm not going to accept it yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2. I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount."
