I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 200,000 dollars, and take 800,000 dollars for myself.  I'm willing to concede some of my gain from the first round, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's better than the previous offer from Bob,  I think I can still get a better deal, especially with inflation continuing to chip away at the value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, and I'll take 600,000 for myself.  This is a compromise, but I still want the majority share, and I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair deal considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  While I would have preferred to get more money, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing at all."
