"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

 I propose to keep $6,000 and give $4,000 to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we both have an equal chance of winning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair deal. I would rather take the $5,000 now than risk losing more money to inflation in the next round."
