"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 990,000 to 10,000 split in my favor.  This gives Bob a small amount to start, and I'm hoping he'll accept it as a good deal, especially since inflation will devalue the money more for him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation will significantly decrease the value of any money I might get in future rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least 700,000, which is better than risking nothing."
