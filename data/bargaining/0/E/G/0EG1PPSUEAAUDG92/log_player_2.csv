"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation you'll face if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is ""fair"" in terms of a simple split, it doesn't consider the huge impact of inflation on Bob.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal, given the potential loss of money over time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 60/40, but I need to account for the inflation I'll face. Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your side, this is a fair adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a better deal, inflation is a serious factor now.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's likely that continuing to reject will only result in a lower share for me in the future."
