"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3000 is worth $3,000 / 0.9 = $3,333.33 in the first round's value.

I don't like the offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm offering to take $4,200 and leave $5,800 for Bob."
