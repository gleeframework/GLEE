I'm Bob, and that's not a fair offer. I need more than $1!  Let's see what I can offer Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much better offer than the first round.  While I'm getting less than I proposed, it's still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk getting nothing due to inflation.  I'll accept."
