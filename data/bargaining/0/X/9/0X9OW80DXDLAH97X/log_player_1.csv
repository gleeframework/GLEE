I'm starting with an aggressive offer. I want to secure almost all of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with a tiny bit to incentivize him to accept. This way, we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at the value of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is significantly better for him than my offer was for me in the first round. However, it's still a very lopsided deal in his favor. I'm willing to gamble and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going for a more balanced offer this time.  I believe that by offering a more reasonable split, I can increase the likelihood of Bob accepting.  This will also help me avoid further inflation."
