"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We both get a good chunk and avoid the risk of losing everything as the rounds go on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I'll have to calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: $5,000 (initially) x 90% (due to 10% inflation) = $4,500
* Bob's gain: $5,000 (no inflation)

Considering the inflation, I'd rather take the $4,500 now than risk losing more value in the future. I'll accept Bob's offer.
