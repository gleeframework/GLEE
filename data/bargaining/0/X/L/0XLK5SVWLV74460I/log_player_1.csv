"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We can both get a good deal, and avoid any unnecessary risk of losing money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to aim for a higher amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too. Let's end this before we both lose more money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, $45 is a reasonable amount for me, and I don't want to risk losing more money in future rounds. It's a good time to cut our losses and take what we can get."
