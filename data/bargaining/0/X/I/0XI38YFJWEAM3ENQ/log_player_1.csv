Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see how Bob feels about this offer!  I'm aiming for a fair split, but I'm also keeping in mind the inflation rates will hit him harder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation will likely make it harder to get a better offer in the next round.  I'll take the 5500 and call it a day."
