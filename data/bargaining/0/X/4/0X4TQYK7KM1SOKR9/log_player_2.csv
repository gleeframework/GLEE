"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think 60/40 is a good split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is more fair considering the inflation""}\n\n###\nI made a counteroffer, taking into account that with each passing round, the value of money decreases more significantly for Alice than for me. Waiting for Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go for a 50/50 split this time. It's the fairest way to divide the money, and it's better than constantly fighting over a few extra dollars. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the impact of inflation on both of our gains, a 50/50 split at this point seems fair and reasonable. The diminishing value of money with each round makes further negotiation less beneficial."
