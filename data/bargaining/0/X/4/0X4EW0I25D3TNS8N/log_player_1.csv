"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, but I believe I deserve a bit more since I made the first offer. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share, but I need a fair deal too.  This is a bit more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer is more balanced, but I still think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me, I don't have to worry about inflation, but Bob does. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round, trying to take advantage of Bob's decreasing money value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer""}\n\nSince Bob's money is worth 5% less in each round, I'll try to take advantage of this by offering him a smaller share. I'll still give him a significant amount, $450,000, but I believe I can get away with taking a bit more. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  This is my final offer, it's more than fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is Bob's final offer, I need to consider it carefully. However, I still think I can get a better deal. But, looking at the numbers, Bob's offer is quite close to a 50/50 split, and considering the inflation, his share is actually worth less than it seems. I'll take a closer look... Ah, wait, I just realized that if we go to the next round, Bob's money will be worth even less, but he's already made it clear that this is his final offer. That means if I reject it, I risk getting nothing. Hmm... In that case...
