Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn.  I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself this time.  Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer is a good compromise considering the inflation. Let's be practical and end this here. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently aiming for a larger share, and the inflation is hurting him more than me. While the offer is getting closer to something I might consider, I believe I can still secure a better deal by holding out a little longer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""bob_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's be reasonable and wrap this up.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing if we continue to round 12. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is unlikely to offer anything better.  A guaranteed $500,000 is better than the potential for zero."
