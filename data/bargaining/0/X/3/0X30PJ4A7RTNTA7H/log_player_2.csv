Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer isn't terrible, I think I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two.  I need to balance getting a good share with the risk of letting this drag on too long."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's split it evenly. This is the most rational choice at this point.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I was holding out for a slightly larger share, it's getting risky. Alice is likely frustrated and the longer this goes on, the less appealing her offers might become.  A 50/50 split ensures we both get a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
