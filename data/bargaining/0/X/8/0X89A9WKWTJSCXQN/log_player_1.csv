"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I'll have to decide. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, $500,000 is now equivalent to $400,000 in the first round's value. This is a decent offer, but I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a better share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than that, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, $400,000 is now equivalent to $520,000 in the first round's value, and $600,000 is equivalent to $800,000 in the first round's value. This is a tough decision, but I think I'll take the offer.
