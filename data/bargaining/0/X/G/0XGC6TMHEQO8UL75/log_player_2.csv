Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is fair and the clock is ticking.  Let's be smart and take this deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, which means my previous rejections have put pressure on her. While the inflation is starting to eat into the potential gains, I'm betting Alice will crack before I do.  I'm aiming for a slightly better deal than this."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's settle this.  This offer is practically a 50/50 split, considering the time pressure.  It makes no sense to risk losing everything.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to secure a deal while maximizing my share. Since Alice is getting increasingly impatient, I'm nudging my offer closer to the middle ground. This creates an illusion of compromise while still giving me a slight edge. The message emphasizes the risk of losing everything, reminding Alice that accepting a less-than-ideal offer is better than getting nothing."
