Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I won't accept anything less than 650,000. This offer is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting very demanding and inflexible.  While $350,000 is a significant sum, accepting this offer sets a bad precedent for future rounds. She might be bluffing about her ""final compromise."" I need to show I'm willing to walk away to get a better deal."
