Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%.  70/30 seems like a reasonable split given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting us both, but I need a little more than 45%.  60/40 seems like a fair compromise. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nReasoning: Given the rapid devaluation of money due to inflation, especially for Alice, her offer of 60/40 seems increasingly reasonable. Each round, the value of the money decreases significantly more for Alice than for me, making her willingness to compromise more pronounced as the game progresses. Continuing the game would likely result in further losses for both of us, but more so for Alice, potentially leading to even less favorable offers in the future. Accepting now secures a significant amount before the value drops further.\n\n###"
