Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a more equitable split. Consider the declining value for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair deal considering the time pressure. Let's settle this now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's my final offer. It's a reasonable split considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best course of action for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of Bob's potential gain is rapidly decreasing due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Final Offer:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Rejecting it means Bob risks walking away with nothing. 
* **Better Than Nothing:** While not ideal,  $450,000 is still a significant sum, even with the inflation taken into account. It's better to secure something rather than gamble on an increasingly unlikely better outcome."
