"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can work out a more even split later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, I need to consider the long-term consequences of accepting. Accepting her offer would mean starting the game at a significant disadvantage, as the money will be worth less for me in subsequent rounds. It's better to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. This way, we can both benefit from the remaining rounds.""}
