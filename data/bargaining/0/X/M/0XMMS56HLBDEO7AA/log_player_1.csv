Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference. I'll take 40% this time, and we can discuss a fairer split later if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
