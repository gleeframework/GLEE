Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is hurting us both, so a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get something worthwhile.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the impact of inflation on the money's value for both players.
Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less for Bob and 5% less for Alice, we must factor this into our decision-making process. By round 4, the money's value has decreased significantly for Bob and slightly less so for Alice.

### Step 2: Evaluate the previous offers and the reasons for rejection.
Alice's initial offer gave Bob $1000, which was rejected for being too low. Bob's counteroffer of a 60/40 split was rejected by Alice, possibly for not giving her enough. Then, Alice proposed a 50/50 split, considering inflation, which Bob rejected.

### Step 3: Determine a fair offer considering the current state of inflation.
Since the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob, he should aim to settle the deal sooner rather than later. However, he also wants to maximize his gain. Given Alice's rejection of the 60/40 split and her offer of a 50/50 split, Bob might consider a compromise that slightly favors him due to his greater loss from inflation.

### Step 4: Calculate the offer.
Considering the factors above, a reasonable offer might slightly adjust from the 50/50 split, considering Bob's greater loss from inflation but still aiming for a compromise. A 55/45 split could be seen as a middle ground, acknowledging Alice's offer while addressing Bob's greater loss from inflation.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer in the required JSON format.
Given the decision, the offer should be structured as follows:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I propose a slightly adjusted split to find a middle ground between our offers.""}

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I propose a slightly adjusted split to find a middle ground between our offers.""}"
