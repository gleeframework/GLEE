"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small share and let's be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer is too skewed in Alice's favor, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more balanced. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll try to find a middle ground that benefits both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This way, we both get a fair share, considering the decreasing value of the money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 60/40, taking into account the dwindling value of the money.  This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although Alice is willing to compromise, the 60/40 split still favors her, and the decreasing value of the money affects her more significantly. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since Alice is more affected by the inflation, I'll try to find a balance that benefits both of us.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this split is more reasonable. We both get a significant share, and it's a better deal for you than the previous offers, given the decreasing value of the money.""}"
