I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept and avoid any potential losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer.  While it might seem tempting at first, I know that inflation will continue to eat away at the value of the money. I'm better off holding out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to account for the fact that the money is now worth less. However, I'm still aiming for a split that is significantly more in my favor than Bob's previous proposal."
