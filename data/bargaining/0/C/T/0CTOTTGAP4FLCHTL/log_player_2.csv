"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to settle due to the higher inflation rate you face. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this scenario, I'm choosing to reject Alice's offer because, despite the urgency created by the higher inflation rate I face, accepting 40% of the initial amount in the first round might not be the most advantageous decision, especially considering the significant difference in our inflation rates. There's room to negotiate for a better split in subsequent rounds, potentially leveraging the fact that Alice also faces a decrease in value, albeit at a slower rate. Rejecting this offer allows me to propose a counteroffer in the next round that might be more favorable, taking into account both our depreciating values but aiming to capitalize on Alice's desire to settle as well."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering both our depreciating values, I believe a slightly more balanced split is in order, especially given the higher rate at which my share devalues. This offer reflects a compromise, acknowledging your initial generosity while adjusting for the urgency I face.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making an offer that slightly adjusts the split in my favor, considering the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains but emphasizing the greater urgency on my part due to the higher rate of depreciation. By suggesting a division of 45% for myself and 55% for Alice, I aim to negotiate a more favorable share while still presenting a reasonable offer that might appeal to Alice's desire to settle the negotiation. The message is crafted to convey a sense of compromise and urgency, highlighting the mutual impact of inflation while underscoring my slightly greater incentive to reach a quicker resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the situation with the inflation, but your offer was too low. I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split that still acknowledges your need for a quicker resolution. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this round, I'm choosing to reject Alice's offer because, despite her slight adjustment, the split still doesn't adequately address the increasing urgency I face due to the higher inflation rate impacting my potential gains. Given that we're now in the third round and the value of the money continues to depreciate more significantly for me, I believe there's still room to negotiate for a more favorable split. Alice's offer of 42.5% for me and 57.5% for her does not sufficiently compensate for the 19% reduction in value I've already incurred, especially when compared to her 9.75% reduction. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation, aiming for a split that better reflects the disparate impacts of inflation on our respective gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I'm compelled to seek a more substantial adjustment. This offer reflects the growing urgency I face, and I believe it's a crucial step towards finding a mutually acceptable solution before the value of our potential gains decreases further.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making an offer that more assertively adjusts the split in my favor, directly addressing the heightened urgency due to the mounting impact of inflation on my potential gains. By suggesting a division of 48% for myself and 52% for Alice, I aim to underscore the critical nature of reaching a settlement that accounts for the disparate effects of inflation on our respective shares. This offer is crafted to convey a sense of necessity and a stronger push for a resolution that reflects the increasingly unequal devaluation of our potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to reach an agreement soon. This is my final offer, splitting the difference between our previous proposals. It's important we both walk away with something substantial before inflation erodes the value further. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn this round, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains and the fact that Alice has framed this as her final offer, I've decided to accept the proposed split. The offer of 46% for me and 54% for Alice, while not ideal, represents a compromise that acknowledges the urgency of the situation and the need for both parties to walk away with a substantial amount before further devaluation occurs. Given the 34.39% reduction in value I've already incurred and the risk of further losses if negotiations continue, accepting this offer seems the most prudent decision to secure a tangible gain, despite the initial aspiration for a more favorable split."
