"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving Bob with $4,000. My message is a friendly and straightforward proposal to split the money 60-40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, I'll try to balance it out 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

Considering the inflation rates, my $6,000 from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $5,400. Bob's $4,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3,800.

Bob's offer is to give me $2,500 and take $7,500. This is a significant increase in Bob's share, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal.

I'll reject this offer for now. My counteroffer will be more aggressive.
