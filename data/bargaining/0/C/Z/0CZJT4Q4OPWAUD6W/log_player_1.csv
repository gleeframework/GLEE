"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it closer to 50/50 this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I initially offered Bob $40 and now he's offering me $45, I see this as a slightly better deal for me, even though it's not as much as I initially wanted. However, considering the inflation doesn't affect me and Bob is essentially offering more than what I was willing to give him in the first round, I think it's a reasonable compromise.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer of $45 for myself and $55 for him, considering it a fairer split given the circumstances and the impact of inflation on Bob's gains."
