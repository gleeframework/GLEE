"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the initial $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of its original value. Bob's gain of $60 is worth 90% of its original value.

Since Bob's offer is the same as the one I made in Round 1, but with a slightly smaller effective value for Bob, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer will be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52
}
```

I'm offering Bob $52, which is a slightly more modest amount than before, considering the ongoing inflation."
