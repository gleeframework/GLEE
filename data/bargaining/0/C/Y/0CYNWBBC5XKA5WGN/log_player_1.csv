I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping to secure a good portion of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible.  He's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him! I'll make a better counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm decreasing my offer, but I'm still going for a significant portion of the money.  I think Bob will start to realize that he needs to compromise if he wants to get anything at all."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. With inflation hitting us both, I need to secure a good chunk before it gets too late. Hopefully, Bob will finally realize that he needs to compromise."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

I'm lowering my offer again, but it's important to make progress. We're getting close to the end of the game and the inflation is starting to bite. This offer should still be appealing enough for Bob, given his declining gains too.  It's time for him to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn, but I'm going to keep fighting for a better deal. We're running out of time and the inflation is getting worse, but I won't be pushed around. I'm confident I can secure a better offer."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

With inflation hitting both of us hard, and only a few rounds left, it's time to compromise.  I'm offering an even split. I believe it's the fairest option given the circumstances and hopefully, Bob will agree.  It's a better outcome than both of us ending up with nothing."
