Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

This is a classic example of the Ultimatum Game with the added pressure of inflation.  While I would have preferred a slightly larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes the most sense:

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value quickly. Holding out for a better deal in later rounds is risky.
* **Fairness:**  Bob's offer is fair, and rejecting it might lead him to propose even less favorable terms in future rounds. 
* **Certainty:**  Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout. Rejecting keeps the outcome uncertain."
