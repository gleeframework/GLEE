"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the whole $100. You can start negotiating from here.""
}
```

I'm making a bold opening offer, hoping to get a good starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to share a bit. Let's work something out. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for Bob, he's trying to take a larger share. I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more balanced. Since Bob is willing to share, I'll try to get a bigger share now that the money is worth less for him.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need a bit more for myself.""
}
```"
