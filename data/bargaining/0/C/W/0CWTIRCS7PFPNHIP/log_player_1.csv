Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Fair share, let's be friends!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a decent share, but I'm also making sure I get a bit more since I'm making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair but also take into account the inflation! I think this offer is more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous!""}\n\nI'm taking into account that the money is worth less to me now, but I still want to make a relatively strong offer to try to end the game. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
