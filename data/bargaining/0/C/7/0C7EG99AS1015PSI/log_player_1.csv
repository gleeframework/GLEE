  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob! What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the actual amount I would get is 4500$ (5000 * 0.9).

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 40/60. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"

```
