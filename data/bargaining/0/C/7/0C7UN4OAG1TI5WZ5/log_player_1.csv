"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm trying to get a good starting position before the inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is getting scarcer. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This time, I'm pushing for a slightly larger share, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect taking a bigger hit, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a 58/42 split, but it's closer to what I initially offered in round 1. I'll consider it, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really taking a toll now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share, but I'll have to be careful not to leave Bob with too little. Here's my proposal for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This time, I'm pushing for an even larger share, but I'm leaving Bob with a relatively small amount. It's a risk, but I think it's worth it given the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money. Bob's offer is a 45/55 split, which is actually more favorable to him than my previous offer. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think I should accept this offer to avoid getting even less in the next round.
