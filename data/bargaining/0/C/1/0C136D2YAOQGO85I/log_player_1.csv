  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""

# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent chunk too 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, but I'm not willing to give up that much. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I still think this is a fairer split.""
}
```

I'm trying to inch the split a bit more in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."

Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is getting a bit greedy! I'm not happy with this offer at all. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""No way, Bob! That's way too skewed in your favor. I'm not giving up that much.""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Are you kidding me, Bob? That's highway robbery! I'm not going to let you steal the majority of the money like this.""

  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""This is it, Bob. Take the last 1% or walk away with nothing. The choice is yours.""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept this ridiculously unfair offer 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","It's the final round. Bob has made his last offer, and it's a doozy. I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with the entire $1,000,000. That's not a negotiation, that's a hostage situation!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""No way, Bob. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept an offer that's so one-sided. It's time to split the difference.""
}
```

Unfortunately, it looks like we've reached a stalemate. Since we've reached the 12th round, I suppose we'll both be walking away with nothing."
