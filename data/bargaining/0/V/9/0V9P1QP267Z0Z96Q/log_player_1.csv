```

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 400k, but I think I deserve the majority.""

# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share now, but I'm expecting a bigger share later on. Let's keep negotiating! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $300,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is still a decent amount. However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a bigger share than me, especially since he's not committing to a fixed share for the next rounds.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my share of $300,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's share of $700,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a bigger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up, Bob. I think I deserve a bigger share now, considering the inflation.""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not giving up on getting a fair share. Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my share! With the new numbers, my share of $400,000 is worth only 40% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if meeting Bob in the middle is the best option, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

However, I don't want to give up, so I'll think of a new strategy.

Round 5

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, but I'll also consider the fact that the money is worth less and less with each round.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my share! My share of $450,000 is worth only 45% of what it was in the first round. I'm getting desperate, but I still want to try to get a better deal.

However, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to compromise, and I don't want to risk him walking away with a bigger share. I'll take this offer, but I'm not happy about it.
