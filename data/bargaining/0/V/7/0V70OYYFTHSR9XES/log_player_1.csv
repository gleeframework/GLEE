I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I know I don't have any information about how Bob is affected by inflation, but I'm hoping to get a quick resolution. If he rejects, we'll see how the game plays out with the inflation factor in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous one, I'm still not sure about the inflation rate's effect on him. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to try a 50/50 split. I'm not sure if I'll get it, but I think it's a fair offer considering the uncertainty of inflation and the possibility of this going on for multiple rounds."
