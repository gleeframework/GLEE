"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly larger share this round 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to see if I can get a better deal in the next round!  I know the money is worth less each round, but I'm willing to risk it for a potentially larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. Let's try this!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's not a terrible deal considering the circumstances."
