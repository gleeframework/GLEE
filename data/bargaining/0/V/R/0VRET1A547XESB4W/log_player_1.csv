"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point considering the inflation we're facing.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's meet in the middle - this split accounts for the inflation while being more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is tempting since it's better than what I'd get if I reject and propose a 50/50 split in the next round.  Let's accept.
