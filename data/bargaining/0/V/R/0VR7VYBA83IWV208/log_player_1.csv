"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting a fair split and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with an unfair offer, now it's my turn to propose a fair split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that the money is worth 20% less now, so the actual amount I'd get is 560,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable proposal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
