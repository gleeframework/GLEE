Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is already costing us both.  I'm willing to compromise, but it needs to be fair. This offer reflects the time-value of our money. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time here.  This offer is the best I can do considering the circumstances.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  We both lose if this goes on any longer. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the better option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The money is losing value rapidly. While Bob might want a better share, holding out risks getting even less in the next round.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her ""final offer"" message suggests she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Present Value:** Even though $4,800 is less than what Alice initially offered, it's worth considering the time-value of money. Delaying further significantly erodes the deal's value. 

While not ideal, accepting secures Bob a reasonable sum before inflation eats away at the potential gains."
