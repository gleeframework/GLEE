"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in Round 3, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm offering a slightly biased split in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain by 27.1% compared to Round 1, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a 55-45 split, but it's not as favorable as my previous offer in Round 3, adjusted for inflation.
