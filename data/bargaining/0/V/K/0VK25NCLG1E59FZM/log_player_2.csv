"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but let's get this started.  You get 1% to start, but things can change if you don't accept.

# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the time pressure and inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to concede a bit, but let's split it closer to 55/45. We're losing money with each round, so it's in both our interests to come to an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The threat of inflation means we need to reach a deal soon, but not at the cost of a significantly unfair split. I'm betting Alice will become more reasonable in the next round as the deadline approaches."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement in your last offer.  However, a 60/40 split feels much fairer considering the circumstances.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're approaching the danger zone. Let's be realistic and split it evenly.  50/50 is the fairest outcome at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is finally being reasonable!  While I believe I could have negotiated a slightly better deal, a 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the significant impact inflation is having on the value of the money.  Accepting now guarantees a decent outcome and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
