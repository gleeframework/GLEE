"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. An even split seems like the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that an even split is the best way to start, especially considering the inflation effect. I'd like to propose a different solution that takes into account the decreasing value of money. I'll wait for my turn to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the inflation""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, where I get 55 dollars and Bob gets 45 dollars. I'm trying to take into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation, and I think this split is more reasonable given the current circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to compromise. A slightly larger share for me seems fair given the inflation, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 45-55 split, especially considering the significant decrease in the value of my share due to inflation. I was hoping for a more substantial adjustment to account for the decreasing value of money. I'll wait for my turn to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, but only if you agree to adjust the split if the inflation rate changes""}

I'm willing to compromise and accept an even split, but I want to make sure that we revisit the split if the inflation rate continues to decrease the value of the money. I think this is a fair compromise, and it gives us a chance to reassess the split in future rounds."
