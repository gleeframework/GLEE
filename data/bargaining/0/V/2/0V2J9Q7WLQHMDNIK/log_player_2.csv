Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think 65% for me and 35% for you is a fair deal now 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Since the value of the money is decreasing for me, I need to get a larger share. I propose a 60/40 split, which is fair considering the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the substantial impact of inflation on your share, I think 70% for me and 30% for you is a reasonable split now 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is significantly less than what I initially aimed for, the continuous inflation makes it increasingly risky to reject and hope for a better outcome in the next round. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than ideal, while further rejection risks losing everything."
