"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 70 and you take 30.""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable to start with. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. I'm sure we can both agree that's the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 is now worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's effectively worth 45.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk waiting for a potentially worse offer."
