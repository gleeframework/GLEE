"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can have the first turn next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take $600,000, which is 60%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep most of it for myself 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $600,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'd actually be getting $540,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $300,000, which is worth 90% of its original value, or $270,000.

I'm not thrilled about the deal, but I'll accept it for now, hoping to do better in the next round.
