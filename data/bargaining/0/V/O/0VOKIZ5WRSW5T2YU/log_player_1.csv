"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 60-40 in my favor. This gives me $600,000 and leaves $400,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting that we start with a fair split and can adjust from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $600,000 gain in Round 1 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $570,000. Bob's $400,000 gain is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $320,000.

Considering Bob's offer in Round 2, I'm not thrilled about the 50-70 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept the offer.
