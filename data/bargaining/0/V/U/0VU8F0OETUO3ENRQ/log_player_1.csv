"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start, then we can reassess in the next round""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round, where the money will be worth 90% of its original value."
