"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make an offer to divide the money. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I still have to make a decision.

I'll reject this offer. The money I would gain is worth significantly less than in the previous round, and I'm not willing to accept such a low amount.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% in the first round and another 20% in the second round), I'll aim to get a better share.

Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. It's a more balanced offer, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
