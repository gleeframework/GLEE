"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large share (900,000$) while still giving Bob a decent amount (100,000$). It might be tempting for Bob to reject and hope for a better offer in the next round, but the risk is that the money will be worth less for me in the next round, making me less likely to offer a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer gives me a substantial amount, it's still significantly less than my initial offer. Considering the inflation factor and my desire for a larger share, I believe I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This offer is a compromise, giving Bob a larger share than my initial offer while still securing a majority for myself.  The inflation factor is now significant, so it's important to strike a balance between getting a good deal and ensuring that the negotiation doesn't drag on too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I would gain, I'm accepting this offer.  The risk of rejecting is too high, as I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round, and further inflation will only hurt me. It's time to secure a portion of the money before it becomes practically worthless."
