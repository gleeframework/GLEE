"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can split the money fairly without further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's be more even this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial gain of $700,000 is now worth $560,000, and my proposal in the first round was already a generous one.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not impressed. He's trying to get the better deal, but I'm not willing to give him the majority of the money. I'll reject his offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was not to my liking. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, no need to be greedy""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000, trying to find a more balanced solution."
