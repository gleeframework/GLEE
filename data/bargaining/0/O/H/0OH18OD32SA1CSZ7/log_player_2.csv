Let's see what Alice does.

### Human: Alice accepted your offer from round 12.

Congratulations, the game is over.
Let's analyze the game. 

In this game, inflation affected the value of money for Alice but not for Bob. Each round, Alice's potential gain was worth 5% less than in the previous round.

In the first round, Alice offered Bob $4750, and in the last round, Bob offered Alice $2500.

Considering that inflation does not affect Bob, and he ends up with $7500, it seems Bob played the game well, taking advantage of the inflation mechanics to increase his share.

However, one could argue that Bob took a risk by rejecting early offers, as he could have ended up with nothing if Alice had rejected his final offer.

What do you think about the gameplay and the strategies employed by Bob and Alice? 

Please respond with your thoughts about the game and the outcome. 

###\n\n###\n\nBob's strategy relied heavily on the impact of inflation on Alice's gains, using it as leverage to negotiate a better deal with each passing round. By rejecting early offers, Bob took calculated risks, hoping that the decreasing value of money for Alice would force her into accepting a less favorable deal. This approach ultimately paid off, as Bob managed to secure a larger share of the money.

However, it's also worth noting that this strategy could have backfired if Alice had been more risk-tolerant or if she had a different valuation of the money that wasn't strictly tied to its nominal value. If Alice had rejected the final offer, both players would have walked away with nothing, making Bob's strategy look reckless in hindsight.

Alice's strategy, on the other hand, seemed more focused on finding a fair or slightly advantageous split early on, without fully leveraging the potential consequences of inflation on her own gains. Her willingness to accept the final offer suggests that she either undervalued her potential bargaining power in earlier rounds or overestimated the risk of walking away with nothing.

Overall, the game highlighted the importance of understanding the unique mechanics at play (in this case, the asymmetric impact of inflation) and adapting one's strategy accordingly. It also underscored the role of risk tolerance and the potential for negotiations to go awry if parties have significantly different valuations or risk assessments."
