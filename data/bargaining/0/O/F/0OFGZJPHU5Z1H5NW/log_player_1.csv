I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, as I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise. With inflation in play, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
