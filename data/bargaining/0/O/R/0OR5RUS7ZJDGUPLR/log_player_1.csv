"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping to get the majority of the money. The message is a bit provocative, trying to pressure Bob into accepting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed by Bob's offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round, considering the money is still worth the same for me, but only 80% of its original value for him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away with all the money that easily, Bob!""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm offering Bob slightly, but still trying to get the majority of the money. The message is a bit confrontational, hoping to put pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's fair 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable this time. Splitting the money down the middle seems fair, considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
