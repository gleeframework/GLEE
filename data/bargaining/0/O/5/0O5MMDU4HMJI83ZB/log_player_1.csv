"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'll make it up to you later 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. On the other hand, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting even less in the next round.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll on my potential earnings, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a bigger share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the lead, but I'll make it worth your while if you accept!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still holding out for more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

Considering the offer from Bob, I think I'll take it. 45 is better than 30, and I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
