I propose to take 999,999 dollars and leave 1 dollar for Bob.  It's not the fairest split, but I'm hoping he'll take it to end the game quickly.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's fair and hopefully, Bob will accept it."
