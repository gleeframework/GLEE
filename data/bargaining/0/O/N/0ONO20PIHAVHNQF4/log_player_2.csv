"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk. Let's see how this goes. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a little risky to accept such a low offer in the first round.  There's a lot of time left, and inflation might hurt Alice more than me. Let's see what she offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. We both get a good amount to start with, and we can see how the inflation affects us later.""}
