Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. We both get a good amount to start with, and we can see how the inflation affects us later. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
