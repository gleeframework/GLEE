"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively balanced offer, giving me a slight edge, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount of money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous to himself, but I'm not going to let him get away with it that easily. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me a significant majority of the money, but it's still a high-stakes proposal that might push Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more balanced offer this time. While it's still not the most generous offer, it's a bit more reasonable than his previous one.

I'll accept this offer.
