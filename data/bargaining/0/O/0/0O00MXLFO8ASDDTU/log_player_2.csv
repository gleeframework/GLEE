Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer is fair, and I'm willing to give you a good portion of the money. We're both losing out with every passing round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is more tempting, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer the game goes, the more I lose to inflation. However, accepting a bad deal now means losing out on a significant sum even with inflation factored in. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a better share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable compromise that benefits us both. Let's close this deal now before inflation erodes our gains further.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We are past the halfway point, and inflation is becoming a significant factor.  Alice is clearly aiming for a 60/40 split in her favor, but I need to hold out for a better deal. By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to convey the urgency of the situation and push her towards a more equitable agreement."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting tired of this game. I'm offering you a fair share, let's just end this and split the money. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with time running out and inflation eating into my potential gains, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and every round that passes significantly diminishes my potential gains. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I'm not getting my ideal split, waiting longer might force me to accept an even worse deal due to inflation.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice seems firm on a 55/45 split. Rejecting this offer might make her dig in further, leading to a worse outcome for me in the end.

While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable sum and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
