Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to maximize my gain. However, Bob's offer is not as favorable as my initial 50-50 proposal.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.
