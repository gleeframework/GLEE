"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll aim to get a bigger share to compensate for the future devaluation of Alice's share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 36 
# Alice gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but Alice's share is worth 36% less than the original amount, I'll try to take advantage of this difference. I'll accept this offer.
