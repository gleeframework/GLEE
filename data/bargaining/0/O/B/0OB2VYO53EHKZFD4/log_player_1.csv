"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I take $999,999 and Bob gets $1. 

It's a pretty obvious first move, as I get almost all the money and if Bob rejects, he loses out on a dollar."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep the majority of the money, this offer is still significantly better than the previous round where I would have gotten nothing. Accepting this means I gain 505,000 dollars, which is a good outcome for me."
