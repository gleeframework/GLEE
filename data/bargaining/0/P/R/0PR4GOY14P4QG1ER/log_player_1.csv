"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since I'm making the offer. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer this time. I think I can do better than a 40/60 split. I'll make a new offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll think carefully about my next offer..."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, 55/45. It's still a good deal for both of us!""}

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my initial proposal, but still gives Bob a decent share. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
