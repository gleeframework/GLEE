"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI am offering $5,500 for myself and $4,500 for Bob, with the message ""Let's be fair""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, I'll calculate its current value. The offer of $4,000 for me is actually worth $3,200 ($4,000 * 0.8). Considering this, I think I can get a better deal in the next round, so I'll reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% less to me than in the first round (20% less in the second round, and another 20% less in this round). I'll take this into account when making my offer. I'll offer $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob, but keep in mind that the $6,000 is actually worth $3,600 ($6,000 * 0.6). I'll attach a message to try to convince Bob to accept my offer.
