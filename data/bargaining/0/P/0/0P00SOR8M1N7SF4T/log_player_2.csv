"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal where we both benefit. I get $7000, and you get $3000.  Think about the long game, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! This is my final offer. Let's close this deal now before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, Alice's offer seems relatively more attractive now compared to the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds. It's better to secure this amount now rather than gamble on an uncertain future value."
