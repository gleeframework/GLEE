"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving you the upper hand 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd like to gain more than Bob. Meeting in the middle is a good starting point, but I'm not willing to settle for an equal split so early in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less now, so I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You can't have all the fun, Bob. I'm taking a bigger share this time!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me $700,000 and Bob $300,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice. Time to make a more reasonable offer 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, but I still want to aim for a better share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd like to gain more than Bob. The 45-55 split is closer to an equal split, but I'm not willing to give up more than 10% of the total to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's see if you can meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $550,000 and Bob $450,000. This is a slightly better deal for me, but still a compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
