"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm confident that this is a fair offer, given the limited rounds and the risk of inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Even with the inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change in the split. I'll take my chances in the next round and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. While the inflation is a factor, I'm willing to compromise a bit to ensure we reach an agreement. This offer is still more favorable to me than the previous round's, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the inflation is a significant factor now,  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll take my chances in the next round and see if I can get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. The inflation is becoming a major concern, and I believe this is the most reasonable approach to ensure we both get something. We're now at the halfway point of the rounds, and  the risk of getting nothing is becoming more real. Let's be practical and call it a tie!"
