"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to reject this offer. The inflation is making the money worth less, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2 for me, and I need to make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think I deserve more. Let's meet in the middle... again.""
}
```

I'm proposing a new division of $540,000 for me and $460,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up yet. I'll meet you in the middle again, but I think it's time to be more aggressive. How about we split it 50/50? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is actually a good one. Splitting it 50/50 seems like a reasonable compromise, especially since the money is worth significantly less now.

I'll accept this offer.
