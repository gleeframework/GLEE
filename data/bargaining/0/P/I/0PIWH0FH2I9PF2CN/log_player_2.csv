"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split: 90% for me, 10% for you.  Let's start strong and avoid any potential conflict! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is incredibly unfair. While I understand the need to be ""strong"" and avoid conflict,  a 90/10 split is hardly equitable. Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids any potential conflict. It's time to move on from this initial disagreement and find a workable solution.""}
