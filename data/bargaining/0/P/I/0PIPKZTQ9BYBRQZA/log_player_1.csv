"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is $300,000, which is $100,000 less than my original offer, I'm inclined to accept this offer. It's a bit more favorable for me than the original offer, and I don't want to risk losing out on $100,000.
