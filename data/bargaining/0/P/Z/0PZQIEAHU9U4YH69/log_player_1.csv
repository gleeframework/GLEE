"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I think I deserve a bit more since I made the first offer.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split. Let's get this done quickly so we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll hold out for a better offer or try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
