"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 

I propose a 990,000 / 10,000 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point that gives Bob a small but significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in a later round."
