"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll take the smaller share this round.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the bigger share this round, let's see how you like it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is still affecting my share, I'll try to get a larger share this round. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share this round, but I'll give you a chance to accept!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's only fair! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share! With the money worth 48.8% less, I'd better get a good deal this time. Splitting it down the middle is a reasonable proposal, considering the circumstances.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
