"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\n\nI'll start by proposing a division that seems fair but slightly in my favor, as is typical in negotiation strategies like the Ultimatum Game. I'll offer Bob a bit less than half, hoping he'll see the value in ending the game early and securing a decent sum rather than risking getting less in subsequent rounds.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's end this quickly and both walk away happy.""
}
```

### 

Please let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\n\nBob has decided to reject my initial offer and now proposes an even split. Given that an even split is a perfectly fair division and considering the symmetry of the game, accepting this offer ensures I get half the amount without risking further negotiations that could result in less than half. It's a rational choice to accept an even split when proposed, as it aligns with the principles of fairness and maximizes the utility without further risk.

```json
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

### 

The game concludes here with both players agreeing to an even split of $10,000."
