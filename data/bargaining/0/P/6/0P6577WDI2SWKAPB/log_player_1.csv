"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60-40 split in my favor. It's fair, considering we each get to make an offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think it's fair for Bob to suddenly shift the split in his favor, especially since the money is worth less for him due to inflation. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, a slight adjustment to account for inflation. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the money, taking into account that his share is worth 20% less due to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll counter with 55 for me and 45 for you. Let's find a middle ground, as inflation is making things tougher for me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob is trying to get a better deal as the rounds go on, taking advantage of the fact that his money is worth less due to inflation. I'm not willing to give him 55% of the money, especially since my share is still worth the same amount as in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to adjust my offer to take into account the accelerating inflation. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle, before inflation eats into our shares!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a mutually beneficial agreement before the value of the money continues to erode."
