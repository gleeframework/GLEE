"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a smaller share this round to test the waters""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share this round to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should both get more, but I'm willing to start with a larger share this round.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 in this round is equivalent to $3200 in the first round, which is a relatively small share. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too skewed towards you, I'd like to propose an alternative""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
