"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering you 20% of the original $100, which is a fair share, considering I'm the first to make the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'm not getting as much as I wanted, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with the inflation affecting my gain even more. I'll accept the offer.
