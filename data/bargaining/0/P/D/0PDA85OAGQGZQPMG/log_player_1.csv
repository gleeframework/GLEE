"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in a slightly uneven split, given that the money loses value faster for him. Fingers crossed!"

# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but that's a bit too much for me. How about a 55/45 split in your favor? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
