Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is better than your previous offer. This ensures a decent gain for both of us. Accept this and we can end this game amicably. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
