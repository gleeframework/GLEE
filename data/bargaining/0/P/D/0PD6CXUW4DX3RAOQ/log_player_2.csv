Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I understand you want a larger share, but inflation is working against me. This offer still gives you a good portion and avoids further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
