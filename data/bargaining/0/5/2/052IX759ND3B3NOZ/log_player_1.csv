"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a relatively aggressive offer, but it allows for a large gain for Alice in the first round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to have a larger share, the inflation means that my share would be worth less in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, and it avoids the risk of getting an even worse offer in the next round."
