"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal.  I'm offering you 10% of the money. This gives you a good start and leaves plenty for me. We can always renegotiate later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with only 10% of the money. I think I can get a better deal if I propose something else. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll offer Alice 40% of the money, which I think is a more reasonable split. Since the money loses value for Alice with each round, I'll remind her that it's in her best interest to accept sooner rather than later.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 40% is a fair share for you. Remember, the money is losing value for you with each passing round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the money evenly now. It's clear we can't agree on a deal where one of us gets significantly more. Let's end this on a fair note. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAn even split sounds fair, but considering the money loses value for Alice and not for me, I think I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round. Let's see how Alice reacts!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll offer Alice 45% of the money this time. Given that the money is losing value for her but not for me, I believe this is a reasonable adjustment from the previous even split offer. I'll remind her again of the impact of inflation on her share.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the money's decreasing value for you, I think 45% is a generous offer. It's better to accept now rather than lose more value in the next round.""}"
