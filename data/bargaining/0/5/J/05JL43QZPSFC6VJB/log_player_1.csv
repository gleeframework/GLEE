"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity in the first round, but I think we can do better. Let's split it 60/40, but this time I'll take the larger share.  It's a fair trade, considering the money is now worth less for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
