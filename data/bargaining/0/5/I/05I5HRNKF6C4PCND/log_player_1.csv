Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I propose a more even split - $55 for me, and $45 for you. This way we both get a good amount and avoid the risks of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
