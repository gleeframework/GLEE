I will offer Bob $2,000 and keep $8,000 for myself. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer this round.  I think Bob will be getting nervous about the shrinking value of the money and might be more willing to accept."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is starting to get close to a 50/50 split, and the money is getting worth less with each passing round. It's time to take what I can get."
