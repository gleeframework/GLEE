"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose I take $7000 and you take $3000.  While this might seem a bit uneven, consider the inflation working against you.  Let's wrap this up quickly! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to maximize your gains, but I believe a fairer split is 6000 for me and 4000 for you.  This still accounts for the inflation, but gives us both a more reasonable amount.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is dropping fast for both of us, especially you. I'm proposing $6500 for me and $3500 for you. This is my final offer, take it before it depreciates further! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
