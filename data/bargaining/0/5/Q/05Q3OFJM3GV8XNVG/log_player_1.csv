"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to maximize your gains, but I believe a fairer split is 6000 for me and 4000 for you.  This still accounts for the inflation, but gives us both a more reasonable amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
