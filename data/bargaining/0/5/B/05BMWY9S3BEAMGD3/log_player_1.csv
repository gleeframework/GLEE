"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards him, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 60, and the money is worth 5% less for him now, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself, considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
