Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair, Alice. 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, but it's still not in my favor considering the inflation working against him. I'll hold out for a slightly better deal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is framing his offer as generous due to the inflation, he's still aiming to take slightly more than half. The deal isn't good enough yet, and the pressure from inflation is on him more than me. I'll hold out for a better offer."

# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to use the time pressure to his advantage, but his offer is no better than before. He's still trying to take more than half even though the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for him. I need to stand firm."
