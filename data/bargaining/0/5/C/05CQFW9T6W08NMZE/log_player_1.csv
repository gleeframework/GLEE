"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to keep you interested.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the original 100$, which is 30$ at the current value, and keeping 70% for myself, which is 70$ at the current value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  No need for haggling, this way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round, my gain of 70$ is now worth 56$.

Considering Bob's offer, I see that we would both get 50$ at the current value, which is 40$ for me and 50$ for Bob. This is a good deal for me, as it's a higher amount than I would get if I were to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
