"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm starting with a fair split, offering 50% to each of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, so I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds, I'll offer a slightly higher share to account for the decreasing value.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $3500 is worth 35% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6500 is worth 65% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the large difference in the values, I'll accept the offer.
