Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think we can both do better.  I'm proposing a split of 60/40 in my favor, recognizing the inflationary impact on me, but still giving you a significant share. Let's work towards a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
