Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  While your inflation rate is lower, I'm losing money faster.  Let's be reasonable and end this before we both lose too much. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
