Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Reasoning:

The value of waiting is quickly decreasing, and Alice's offer is better than the likely outcome if I reject again. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** If I reject, I get to propose in Round 4, but the value will have depreciated further.  Even if I could propose a 50/50 split then, the actual value I receive would be significantly less than what Alice is offering now.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice has consistently sought a larger share.  It's unlikely she'll offer a drastically better deal in a future round, especially as she knows the money is depreciating for both of us.

It's a tough decision, but taking the sure thing now makes more sense than risking a worse outcome later.
