"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a tough start, Alice! Let's be more realistic. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  Time is ticking and inflation is hurting you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
