Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're cutting it close. This is a compromise to avoid losing more to inflation. Let's be reasonable and end this here. 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll take the 49 dollars. With inflation eating away at our potential gains, it's better to settle now and get something rather than risk getting nothing if we don't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds."
