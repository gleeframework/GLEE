Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I need a larger share than that to make it worthwhile for me. Time is running out for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 3300 
# Alice gain: 6700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, at this point the effects of inflation are severely impacting my potential gains. Accepting a smaller amount now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
