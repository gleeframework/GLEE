I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor. I figure Bob might be tempted to accept, as he's getting something, and I'll still have a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not going to accept that. I might be losing money each round, but I'm still better off going to the next round and making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time.  Since Bob rejected my first offer, I think he's likely to be more willing to negotiate. If he rejects again, I'll know he's really aiming for a much larger share, and I'll adjust accordingly."
