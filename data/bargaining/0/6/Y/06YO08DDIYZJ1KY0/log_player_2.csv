"Round 1
Alice's offer:

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm not afraid to see what Alice proposes in the next round, especially with inflation coming into play."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We can both benefit from getting our hands on some money before it loses value!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Alice is being more reasonable now and acknowledging the inflation. While I might have preferred an even split, I don't want to risk losing everything due to the shrinking value of the money."
