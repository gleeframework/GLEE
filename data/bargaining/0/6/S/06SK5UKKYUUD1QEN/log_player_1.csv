"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my offer needs to take into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself to compensate for the lost value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
