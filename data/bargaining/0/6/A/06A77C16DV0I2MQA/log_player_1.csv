"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. Since the inflation rate is unknown, I'm trying to maximize my share in the first round.  I expect Bob to reject this offer, but I want to see how he reacts and gauge his risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer, and considering the inflation impacting Bob more than me, it's likely I won't get a better deal in the future. It's best to accept and secure a sizable share of the money."
