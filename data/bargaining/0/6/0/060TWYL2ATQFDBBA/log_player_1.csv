"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better, let's try 60-40 this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is sticking to his 60-40 split, but now with the updated values due to inflation.

In Round 2, the money is worth less, so I'll consider the adjusted values. If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000, which is worth 90% of the original $4,000 from Round 1.

I'll decide to reject this offer since I was hoping to get a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to myself. Given the inflation, I'll aim for a 55-45 split.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 55-45!""
}
```"
