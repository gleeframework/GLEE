"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take a slight advantage since I'm making the offer this round.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't want to give Bob a 60-40 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
