"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation rate, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation rate.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

For me, 400,000 is now worth 320,000 in the first round's money. And 600,000 is now worth 570,000 in the first round's money.

Considering the adjusted values, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the 20% inflation rate, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the money and Bob gets 45%."
