"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it almost evenly, slightly in my favor considering the inflation. This way we both benefit from finishing the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

It's worth it to see if I can get a better deal by waiting one round and making the proposal myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, but consider the inflation: I'm offering you slightly less, but it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this settled. Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  A 50/50 split is the fairest solution considering the circumstances.  
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's in my best interest to accept this offer.  Even though I gain less than my previous offer, I'm guaranteed 500,000 while Alice only gets 500,000 (due to the inflation effect). If I reject, the risk is that she will offer me less in the next round."
