"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'll start by taking the lion's share. Bob will have to decide if they want to take $1 or risk getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Although I'm losing out on a lot of money, I'm still better off taking the risk and seeing what happens in the next round.  The inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me, so it's likely they will make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
``` 

I'm going to offer a more even split this time.  The inflation is starting to affect Bob's gains, so hopefully this is enough to incentivize them to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. The inflation has hit Bob hard, making this offer significantly more appealing than the previous rounds.  I'd prefer to take the 100,000 now than risk getting even less in the next round."
