"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal, especially since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to balance the offer, taking into account the inflation effect and hoping Bob will accept this time!"
