"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm starting with a relatively fair split to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. With the money being worth 10% less, I'm looking for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the decreasing value of money due to inflation. I'm now proposing a 55:45 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
