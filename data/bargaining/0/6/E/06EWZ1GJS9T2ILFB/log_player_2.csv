**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her due to the inflation. While her offer isn't terrible in the face value, we're getting to a point where Bob can start to leverage the situation to his advantage."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a good deal for both of us considering how much value is eroding with each round. Let's be sensible and close this out."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're entering a phase where Bob can start pushing his advantage slightly, but it's important not to get too greedy. A small increase from his previous offer maintains a sense of fairness while still capitalizing on Alice's weakening position."
