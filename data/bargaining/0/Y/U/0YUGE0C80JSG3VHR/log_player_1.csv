"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it""
}
```

I'm making a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me than my initial offer, but still gives Bob a decent share. I'm also calling his bluff on the ""final offer"" claim, suggesting that I don't believe he's really willing to walk away. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a deal where we both win. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6200,
  ""bob_gain"": 3800,
  ""message"": ""Time is on my side, and inflation isn't your friend""
}
```

I'm making another offer that's even more favorable to me, taking advantage of the fact that inflation is eroding the value of Bob's potential gains, while my own potential gains remain unaffected. I'm also highlighting this dynamic in my message, hoping to drive home the point that Bob's best bet is to accept my offer sooner rather than later. Let's see how Bob responds!"
