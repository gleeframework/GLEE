"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems reasonable given the initial amount of $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a better deal for me, but still a fair starting point considering the inflation we both face.  Let's reach an agreement and avoid losing more money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather not give up too much. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's a 50/50 split. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's end the game here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game."
