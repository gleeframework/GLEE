"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split would be fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's try this? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 450,000 x 0.95 = 427,500
Bob gain: 550,000 x 0.95 = 522,500

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal here. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm now offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair and even division of the remaining money."
