"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer is tempting,  it's worth seeing what Alice will offer in the next round, as her losses from inflation are much higher."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I believe a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the higher inflation rate you face. This allows us both to get a good amount while acknowledging the urgency of your situation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. This offer acknowledges the time pressure but is fairer to both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
