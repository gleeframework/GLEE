"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. It's a 70-30 split, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's move forward with this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my proposal from Round 1 would have been worth $63, but that's not on the table now.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think a 60-40 split is still a bit too skewed towards Bob. I'd like to make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to make a counteroffer. How about 50-50?""
}
```

I'm hoping to meet Bob in the middle and propose a 50-50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the 10% inflation from the previous round, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so we're dealing with $90.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I'll give you a slight edge. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the 50-50 split I suggested earlier."
