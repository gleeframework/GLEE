Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I think 4:1 is a fair ratio considering the risk of inflation. This way, we both get a decent amount and avoid the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
