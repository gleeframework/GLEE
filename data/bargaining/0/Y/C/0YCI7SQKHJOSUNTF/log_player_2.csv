Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your offer was generous, but I think this split accounts for the time value of the money.  Let's close this out."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value for me with each round. It's crucial to get a deal done quickly.
* **Fairness vs. Urgency:** While Alice's initial offer was tempting, accepting less than half means I'm losing out significantly due to inflation.
* **Strategic Offer:** Offering slightly more than Alice initially offered (and still a bit over half) might entice her to accept, avoiding further inflation losses for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than my first offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** While Alice points out the impact of inflation, her offer still doesn't adequately compensate for my losses. Accepting 4200 now is significantly less valuable than 4000 in the first round.
* **Holding Strong:** I need to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal that accounts for the declining value of the money.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Alice might dig in her heels, but I'm betting she'll be more open to a favorable split in the next round, especially since the value decreases even further for me if we don't reach an agreement."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. I understand you value fairness, but the money is literally losing value for me with each passing round. This is a compromise, and it's time to finalize this."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  This is my last attempt to secure a deal that makes sense for me. Drawing a line is crucial to signal I'm serious about the impact of inflation.
* **Increased Offer:**  I've significantly increased my offer to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but not to the point of accepting a bad deal due to the time pressure.
* **Direct Communication:**  The message is clear and firm. I'm acknowledging Alice's perspective but also conveying the urgency of the situation from my end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said the money is losing value for you, but it's not for me. This is my best offer yet, considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Desperation Point:** The inflation has eaten away a significant chunk of my potential gains.  While 3800 is far from ideal, it's better than risking another round where I might be forced to accept even less.
* **Alice's Stance:** It's clear Alice is comfortable waiting this out. Her offer, while acknowledging the inflation, is still heavily in her favor.  She's unlikely to budge significantly.
* **Cutting Losses:**  Sometimes the best negotiation is knowing when to salvage what you can. Accepting now cuts my losses and prevents a potentially worse outcome in the next round."
