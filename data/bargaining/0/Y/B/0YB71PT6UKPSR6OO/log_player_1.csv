Inflation is really starting to hurt now. This offer is a significant decrease from my previous ones, but it's the best I can do while still trying to secure a large enough share to make this worthwhile. Hopefully, Bob will see that continuing to reject offers could result in both of us getting nothing at all."

This is a terrible offer, but I have no choice.  With inflation, I'm losing more than 40% of the value of the money.  It's better to take this tiny sliver than to risk getting absolutely nothing at all."
