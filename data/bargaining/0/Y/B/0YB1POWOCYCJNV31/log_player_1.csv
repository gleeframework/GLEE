"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm thinking I deserve more for my negotiating skills.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give away too much too soon. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $400,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $360,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
