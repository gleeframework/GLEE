"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

This is a risky move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount early on.  The next round, the money will be worth less to me, so I'm trying to lock in a good amount now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best move right now.  The money is losing value each round, and taking 600,000 is better than risking getting nothing at the end."
