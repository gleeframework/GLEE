"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of proposing first.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting a free ride, let's split it 60-40 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher!

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I don't want to risk losing more money in the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
