Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanism. While this offer is getting worse, it's still better to hold out hope for a more equitable split or to push Alice to accept a 50/50 split in a later round.  The longer the game goes on, the more desperate she might become, offering me a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  Take a slightly better deal than before, or we both lose out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to start making concessions to show willingness to negotiate, but not too much. Offering Alice a slight edge might be enough to entice her while still securing a reasonable share for me given the increasing inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm not. I'll take a bit more again 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is getting very dangerous, but Alice is clearly overplaying her hand.  While a 38/62 split after inflation is terrible, accepting anything less than 40/60 sets a very bad precedent.  I'm banking on her cracking under pressure in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to lay down the law. I'm significantly decreasing my ask to 45/55, a split that heavily favors Alice but still leaves me with something.  The ""final offer"" language is crucial here - it signals that I'm not backing down any further. This might be enough to scare Alice into accepting, as she's likely feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot as well."
