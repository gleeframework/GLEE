"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm willing to give you a fair share.""
}

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit less than half, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, considering the risk of inflation and the possibility of getting nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering we both have equal bargaining power. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
