"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be fair.  Inflation is a factor, but I think a 50/50 split is the most reasonable solution.  We both get a decent share and we can avoid further rounds of this game. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
