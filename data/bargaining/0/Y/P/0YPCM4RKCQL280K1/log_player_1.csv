"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
``` 
 
I propose a 51/49 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we both have an equal chance of getting to propose in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more equitable split, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Due to inflation, my potential gains in the next round are significantly reduced.  It's better to secure a smaller gain than risk getting nothing at all."
