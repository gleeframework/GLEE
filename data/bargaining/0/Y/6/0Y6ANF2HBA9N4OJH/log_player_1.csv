  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get a slightly better deal to set the tone for the rest of the game."

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, Bob, but don't expect more!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $520,000, which is a bit more than Bob's previous offer. I'm trying to make it clear that I'm making a concession, but I'm not willing to give up much more."

# Bob gain: 510000

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $490,000. I think it's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value. This is a decent compromise, and I'm willing to take it."
