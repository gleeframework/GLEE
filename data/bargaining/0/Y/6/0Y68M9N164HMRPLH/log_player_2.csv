"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'm giving you a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes next. I'm not sure 400,000 is a good chunk, given that I'm going to be losing money with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money evenly after a 200,000$ adjustment in my favor.  Let's be fair."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm giving you a bit more than before, but don't think I'll go much lower. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still not good enough, even with the slight increase. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I'm increasing my offer again.  I know we're both losing money with each round, so let's try to end this quickly.  This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I'll give you one last chance to accept a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still losing money due to inflation, Alice's offer is the best I've received. It's time to end this game."
