Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is costing you, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. We're both losing money with each round, and this is the fairest solution.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, accept before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation is seriously hurting me at this point. Accepting Alice's offer, even though it's unfavorable, ensures I at least get something out of the deal."
