"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think strategically about how to maximize my share. Given that Bob's offer is 55-45 in his favor, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 55-45 in his favor, I'll try to offer a more favorable split to him. However, I'll also try to maintain a reasonable share for myself.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share than his previous offer, while still keeping my share relatively high."
