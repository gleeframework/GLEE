"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and simple."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the 40$ I would get is actually worth 40 * 0.9 = 36$ in the first round's value, which is less than the 50$ I proposed in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next one. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Taking into account the 10% inflation from the previous rounds, I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering a slightly more skewed split in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the 30$ I would get is actually worth 30 * 0.7273 = 21.82$ in the first round's value, which is less than the 45$ I proposed in the third round.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation effect, I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}

I'm offering a more skewed split in Bob's favor, but still a reasonable compromise, considering the decreasing value of money."
