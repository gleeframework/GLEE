"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you take 30.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can start negotiating from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that.  Let's split it 60/40.  We both get a decent share, and it's more fair. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $40 is actually worth $38 (5% less than the original $70).

I'm not too thrilled with Bob's offer, as I'd like to get a bit more. However, it's a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
