"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take a bit more since I'm proposing, but this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'll try to get a higher amount to compensate for the loss in value. Let's proceed to the next round and see what I can propose!"
