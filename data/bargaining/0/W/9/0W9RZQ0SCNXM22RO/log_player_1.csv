"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 6,000 and Bob 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob wants 60% and I want 40%, I'll offer a compromise:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, 52-48 split?""}

I'm offering a 52-48 split, giving me 5,200 and Bob 4,800."
