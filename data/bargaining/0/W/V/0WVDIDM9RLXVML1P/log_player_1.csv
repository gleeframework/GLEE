"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'm not as keen on Bob's offer as I was initially. Since my share is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's share is worth 10% less, I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation is still affecting Bob's share, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
