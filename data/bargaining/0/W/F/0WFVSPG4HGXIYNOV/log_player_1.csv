"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic ultimatum game scenario. I'm offering Bob the minimum possible amount ($1) to maximize my own gain.  I'm betting that Bob will accept this offer, as even a small amount is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to keep more, in the next round, I risk getting nothing.  Accepting this offer ensures I get half the money."
