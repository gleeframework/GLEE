I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself.  Let's see what Alice offers next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point.  Let's work together to find a solution we both agree on.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the split, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, and I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to avoid further inflation."
