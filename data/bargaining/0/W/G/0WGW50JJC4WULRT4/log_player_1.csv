"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nSince I'm Alice, I'll start by proposing a division where I take $60 and Bob takes $40. Given the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases by 20% for me with each round but remains constant for Bob, I have an incentive to try to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I also want to start with a proposal that leaves room for negotiation, as Bob might not accept the first offer, especially considering the uneven split and the fact that he doesn't face the same pressure from inflation. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"" is an attempt to frame my proposal as a compromise, even though it objectively favors me, in hopes that Bob might find it acceptable enough to agree, thus ending the game quickly and favorably for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the current offer from Bob, where I would gain $40 and he would gain $60, and considering that this is only the second round, I believe it's too early to accept an offer that doesn't account for the inflation I'm facing. With the money being worth 20% less to me in this round compared to the first, and with 10 rounds still to go, I'm inclined to reject this offer in hopes of negotiating a better split in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer now would mean I effectively receive less value than the face value of my share due to inflation, while Bob's share remains unaffected, making this proposal less favorable to me than it appears at face value. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a more favorable division that considers the impact of inflation on my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to propose a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. Given that the value of money has decreased by 20% for me since the first round and considering Bob's previous offer, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us. The message ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground"" is intended to convey the impact of inflation on my end and to appeal to Bob's understanding that time is of the essence for reaching an agreement. By slightly increasing Bob's share from my initial offer and decreasing my own, I'm signaling a willingness to compromise while still aiming to mitigate the effects of inflation on my gains. This approach seeks to balance the urgency of reaching an agreement with the need to find a mutually acceptable division of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to take a bit less to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn this round, Bob has offered a division of $45 for me and $55 for himself, with the message ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to take a bit less to avoid further losses from inflation."" Given that we are now in the fourth round and the money is worth 48.8% less to me than in the first round, the pressure from inflation is becoming increasingly significant. Bob's offer, although not perfectly even, represents a compromise from his previous stance and acknowledges the impact of inflation, which suggests he is willing to work towards a mutually acceptable agreement. Considering the diminishing value of the money with each passing round and the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I believe accepting this offer is the most prudent decision. It ensures that I receive a tangible amount, albeit reduced by inflation, rather than risking further devaluation or the possibility of receiving nothing. Thus, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best strategy at this point in the game."
