"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm letting Bob know that I'm looking for a fair and even start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the rest 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is now worth 90% of the original 50, which is $45. Bob's gain of 60 is worth 80% of the original 50, which is $48.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 90% of its original value due to inflation. Since my gain is worth 90% of the original 50, I'll propose a gain of 45.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair split""
}
```

I'm trying to be generous, but I'm also trying to get a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, it's my turn to dictate the terms 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of 30 is worth 90% * 90% * 0.9 = 72.9% of the original 50, which is approximately $36.45.

Bob's gain of 70 is worth 90% * 90% * 0.52 = 40.68% of the original 50, which is approximately $20.34.

I'm not happy with the 70-30 split, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 73.08% of its original value due to inflation. Since my gain is worth 73.08% of the original 50, I'll propose a gain of 36.54.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36.54,
  ""bob_gain"": 63.46,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to be reasonable and consider the effects of inflation, but I'm still hoping for a better deal."
