"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can call it a day."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping most of the money 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my $5,000 gain from the first round is now worth $4,750.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be gaining $4,000, which is worth $3,800 after the 5% inflation.

I'm not satisfied with this offer, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer.

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a fair share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of my potential gains.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be gaining $3,500, which is worth $2,945 after the 14.26% inflation.

I'm still not satisfied with this offer, so I'll reject it.
