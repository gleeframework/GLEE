"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my first offer. I'm taking the vast majority of the money, hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid the devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation means my gains will continue to decrease if I reject. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half of the money, even with the devaluation."
