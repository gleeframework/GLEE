"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nSince we are just starting, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount, considering that inflation will reduce the value of money in subsequent rounds. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a bit more, but that's too much of a difference for me. This is more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, although Bob's proposal seems more balanced, I believe we can still find a better compromise. Given the impact of inflation, I'm willing to take a risk and propose a new division in the next round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway on the last offer, considering inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I've taken into account the inflation factor and Bob's previous offer. By proposing a division closer to equal but still slightly in my favor, I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise, especially since the value of the money will continue to decrease in subsequent rounds."
