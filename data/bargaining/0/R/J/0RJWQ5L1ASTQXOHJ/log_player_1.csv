"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This is my first offer. I'm aiming to get as much as possible, but I know I need to give Bob something to incentivize him to accept.  I'll see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm disappointed that my first offer was rejected, accepting this 50/50 split is the best option.  Inflation is a real threat, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
