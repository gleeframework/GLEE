"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm proposing that Bob gets 30% of the total, which is a relatively small share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's being greedy!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts would be:
Alice gain: 19 (20 x 0.95)
Bob gain: 76 (80 x 0.95)

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time for me to make another proposal!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

This way, we'll both get a decent share, and I'll try to avoid getting taken advantage of again!"
