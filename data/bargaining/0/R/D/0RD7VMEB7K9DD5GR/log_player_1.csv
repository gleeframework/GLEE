"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, considering that I'm the one making the first offer. I'm also taking into account that the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, so I want to try to get a good deal early on. The message I've attached is a friendly and fair-sounding one, in the hopes that Bob will accept my offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch the roles this time. I propose we split it 60-40, with me getting 60% this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not happy with the offer of 40% of the money, especially since the value of my share has already decreased by 20% due to inflation. I was hoping to get a better deal, and I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round, trying to get a better share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to find a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Since the value of the money has decreased by 20% for me again, I'll aim for a slightly lower share than my initial proposal. I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor, which is still a relatively fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money for me. My message to Bob will emphasize the need for compromise and the importance of finding a mutually acceptable solution.\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. 55-45 is a fair compromise.""}"
