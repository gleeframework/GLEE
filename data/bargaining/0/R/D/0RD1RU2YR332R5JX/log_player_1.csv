```

I'll start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that's heavily skewed towards me. This allows me to secure a large portion of the money early on, especially since inflation will affect us both later on.  Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob has reduced his share, I still believe I can get a better deal. Since inflation is affecting us both, I can still propose a deal that benefits me more and keeps Bob's share relatively low. 

This round's rejection keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm proposing a split of 85/15 in my favor.  I'm willing to concede a little bit from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. Bob's offer was too low, and I believe I can secure a better deal.  Inflation is a factor, but I'm confident I can get a good outcome in the next few rounds. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. 

While I'd prefer a larger share, inflation is becoming a serious issue, and my potential gains are being significantly reduced. It's getting increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers. 

Accepting this offer secures me a decent portion of the money and prevents us from reaching a point where both of us get nothing due to inflation. It's a calculated risk, but it's the most logical choice at this stage."
