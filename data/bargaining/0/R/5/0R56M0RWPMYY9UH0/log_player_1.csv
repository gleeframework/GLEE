Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $5000 in Round 2 is worth 80% of $6000, which is $4800. Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 90% of $4000, which is $3600.

I'll reject this offer.
