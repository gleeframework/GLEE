"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob can take the remaining 40%, which is $4,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and square split."
