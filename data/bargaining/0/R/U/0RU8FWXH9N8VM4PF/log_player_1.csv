Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out!  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gain and the fact that Bob claims this is his final offer, I've decided to accept his proposal in this round. The division isn't ideal, but further negotiations might lead to an even less favorable outcome due to the decreasing value of the money for me.\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game with this agreement.\n\n###\n\nPlease confirm the final division of the money according to Bob's offer in round 4.\n\n###\n\nAwaiting confirmation..."
