"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $600,000 in the first round is now worth $480,000, and my gain of $400,000 is now worth $320,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it since it's not as favorable as my original offer. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.
