Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more appropriate considering the inflation that will affect our gains in the next round. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
