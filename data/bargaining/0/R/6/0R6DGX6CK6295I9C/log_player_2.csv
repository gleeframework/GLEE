It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice counters with."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm starting with a counter offer, flipping the initial proposal.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With the inflation, the money is worth less each round.  It's in my best interest to accept this offer before the value drops further."
