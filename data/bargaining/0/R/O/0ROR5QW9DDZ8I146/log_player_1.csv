"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 950,000/50,000 split in my favor. This gives me the majority while still offering Bob a decent sum.  I believe it's a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. While my gain is worth less due to inflation, it's still significantly lower than what I proposed. I'll take my chances with a new round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm proposing a 800,000/200,000 split.  While inflation has eroded the value of the money,  I'm willing to compromise to avoid further risk of losing even more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my gain is significantly less due to inflation, this is still a better outcome than the potential losses if we continue. This offer is at least close to an even split, something I couldn't achieve in the previous rounds.  I'll accept."
