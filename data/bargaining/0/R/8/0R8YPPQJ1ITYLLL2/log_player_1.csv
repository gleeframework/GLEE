Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more equitable split. Let's be fair but also acknowledge the risk of inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
