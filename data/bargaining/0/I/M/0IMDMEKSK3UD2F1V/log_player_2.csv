Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. Take it or we both get less. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is steadily decreasing for Alice, making her more likely to propose better deals for Bob as time goes on. However, this also means that if Bob pushes too hard, they both risk ending up with significantly less.
* **Alice's Final Offer:** Her language suggests she might be getting more serious about reaching an agreement. If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance Alice will offer even less in subsequent rounds, putting Bob in a worse position.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal in later rounds carries the risk of getting a much worse deal or even nothing. Accepting the current offer guarantees Bob a significant sum. 

**In essence, it's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting a worse deal or nothing later.**"
