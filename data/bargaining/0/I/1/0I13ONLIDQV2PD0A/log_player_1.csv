Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. We both have to be willing to compromise if we want to get anything at all. I'm willing to take a little less now to avoid losing even more later. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
