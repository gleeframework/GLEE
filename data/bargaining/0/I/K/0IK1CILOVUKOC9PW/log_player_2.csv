"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think this is a good beginning. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Since the money is worth less each round, I need to maximize my gains early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. This offer is a bit more in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a compromise. This offer is a bit closer to my previous one, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and this offer is better than what I proposed in the previous round. Given the inflation, I'm willing to accept this offer."
