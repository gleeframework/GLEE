"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm starting with a 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed towards me, but still a reasonable compromise considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to add up!

Considering the significantly reduced value of the money I gain, I think Bob's offer is a good opportunity to get a decent share. I'll accept his offer from Round 4.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
