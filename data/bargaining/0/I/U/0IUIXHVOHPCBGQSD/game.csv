5500.0,4500.0,Let's split a bit more than half-half since I'm more affected by inflation. A fair deal to start!,Alice,1,

6000.0,4000.0,"Time is running out!  This is my final offer - it gives me some cushion against inflation, and you still get a significant amount.  Let's close this out.",Alice,5,

5500.0,4500.0,"It seems we're at an impasse. I'm willing to meet you closer to your original offer, but this is my final concession. Take it or leave it.",Bob,6,
,,"Okay, it seems like this is the best we can do at this point. Deal.",Alice,6,accept
