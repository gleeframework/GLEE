"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. This way, we can both walk away with a significant amount of money and avoid the risk of inflation eating into our shares."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get peanuts if you don't accept this! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $100,000 is actually worth $80,000 (80% of $100,000) and Bob's gain of $900,000 is worth $855,000 (95% of $900,000).

I'm not thrilled about the prospect of getting peanuts, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to think carefully...

For now, I'll decide to reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to bite!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll make a new offer. Since my gain is worth 80% of its original value, I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Don't be greedy, Bob! Let's split it fairly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $420,000 and Bob gets $580,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice! I'm not going to let you get away with a pittance! 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the new inflation rates, my gain of $10,000 is actually worth $4,800 (48.8% of $10,000) and Bob's gain of $990,000 is worth $1,078,300 (14.26% less than $1,250,000, which is 95% of the original $1,300,000).

I'm getting desperate, but I'm not ready to accept such a paltry sum. I'll reject the offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really eating into my potential gains!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll make a new offer. Since my gain is worth 48.8% of its original value, I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the loss.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 280000,
  ""bob_gain"": 720000,

}
```

I'm proposing that I get $280,000 and Bob gets $720,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really running out of options, Alice. Don't expect me to go easy on you! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a huge bite out of my potential gains!

Considering the new inflation rates, my gain of $1,000 is actually worth $337 (67.23% of $1,000) and Bob's gain of $999,000 is worth $774,720 (22.62% less than $1,000,000, which is 95% of the original $1,050,000).

I'm really struggling to make ends meet at this point. While I'd love to reject the offer and try to do better, I'm not sure if I can afford to be that optimistic. I'll have to think carefully...

For now, I'll decide to accept the offer.
