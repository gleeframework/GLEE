"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 60-40, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value.

The proposal is to split the money evenly, so I would get $50 and Bob would get $50. This is a good offer, and I'm willing to accept it.
