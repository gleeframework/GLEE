"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. The message is just a friendly greeting, trying to set a positive tone for the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the compromise, as I was hoping for a better deal. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to aim for a more favorable split. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more given the current state of the economy""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, trying to take a slightly more aggressive stance to compensate for the effects of inflation. The message is a gentle reminder that the economy is tough, and I'm willing to make a concession, but I still think I deserve a bigger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'll compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, and my initial hopes for a better deal are dwindling. Considering the current state of the economy, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept the 45-55 split, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point."
