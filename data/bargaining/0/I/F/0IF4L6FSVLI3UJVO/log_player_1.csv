"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly, that way we both get a fair share.  We don't know how the inflation is going to affect us, but we can both benefit from a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
