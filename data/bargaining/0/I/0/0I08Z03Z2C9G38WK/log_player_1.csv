"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth 80% of $600,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is actually worth 90% of $780,000 (since Bob's gain was 80% of $900,000 in the first round).

I think this offer is quite generous, and I'd rather not risk going to the next round. I accept the offer.
