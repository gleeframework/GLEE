**Reasoning:**

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice for Bob, even though it's far from ideal. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is experiencing significant inflation (18.55% already). Every round that passes eats further into his potential gains, making waiting riskier.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share and hasn't budged much in her offers. It's highly unlikely she'll agree to anything significantly better than 70/30.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  Rejecting this offer means Bob risks getting zero if they can't reach an agreement in the next round. Accepting guarantees him at least something.

**Important Note:** While accepting is the mathematically safer option in this specific scenario, a lot depends on how much Bob values the potential future partnership with Alice. If that partnership has significant long-term value, it might be worth risking another rejection."
