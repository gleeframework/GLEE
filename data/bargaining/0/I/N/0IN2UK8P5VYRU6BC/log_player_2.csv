"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to start with something, I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity right off the bat.  I want to see what kind of negotiation Alice is willing to do."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm offering a more balanced split. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, especially as we're both losing value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is fair, and with the inflation, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. It's better to take the sure thing than risk getting nothing."
