I'm proposing to take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000.  Since this is the first round, the money hasn't depreciated yet.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as it's a fairly generous offer for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although I'd prefer to keep more money, I recognize that inflation is working against me.  Accepting this offer means I get $8,000, which is still a decent amount, and avoids the risk of getting less in future rounds."
