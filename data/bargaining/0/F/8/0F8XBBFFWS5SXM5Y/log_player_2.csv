"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a 40/60 split. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given that the money will lose value with each round. Let's agree on this and avoid further losses.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 50/50 split.  I think it's the fairest way to go, considering the time we've wasted already. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and given the inflation, it's best to avoid further losses."
