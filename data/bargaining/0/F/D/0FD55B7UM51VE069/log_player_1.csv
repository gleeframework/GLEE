"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it's still a fair offer considering we are both playing for the most profit. I want to get a sense of Bob's risk aversion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's not worth risking losing even more money due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount, and it's better than potentially getting nothing in later rounds."
