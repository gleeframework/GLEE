"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that's heavily in my favor. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share in the first round, or if he's going to play it tough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, this offer is fair and ensures we both get something. It's better than risking further inflation and losing everything."
