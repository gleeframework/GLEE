"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively generous offer to Bob, considering the initial amount is $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, considering we both lose value over time.  Let's get this game going! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist on Bob's offer!

Considering the inflation factor, I'm not sure if 40 is a good deal for me. My initial calculation was 60-40, but now that the money is worth less, I'd rather aim for a higher percentage. However, I don't want to be too greedy, as I don't know what Bob's next offer will be.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and Bob's money is worth 20% less, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the decreased value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to account for the inflation, let's move forward!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
