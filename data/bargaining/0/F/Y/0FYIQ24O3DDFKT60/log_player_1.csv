"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, let's start with 70-30""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll be willing to accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a more fair split, considering the inflation you'll face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 dollars is actually worth less than 70 dollars in the first round. I'm not sure if 55-45 is a fair split, especially since I'll be facing more inflation in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer needs to be more aggressive to account for the decreasing value of money. I'll offer Bob a smaller share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for more, I'm pushing back, 60-40 for now""
}
```"
