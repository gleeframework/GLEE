Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

 I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a majority share, but still leaves Bob with a small amount. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, as it's better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, this offer is still significantly better than getting nothing in the later rounds.  I'm accepting."
