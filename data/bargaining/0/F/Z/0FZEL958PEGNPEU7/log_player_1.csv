"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'm being too generous, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After calculating the value of the money, I realize that Bob's offer is actually quite tempting. With the reduced value of the money, I'd be getting $400,000, which is still a significant amount.

However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share. Let's try again!""}

I'm proposing a 55.5/44.5 split, where I get a slightly larger share than Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, you're still being too generous! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

After calculating the value of the money, I realize that Bob's offer is even more tempting than before. With the reduced value of the money, I'd be getting $450,000, which is still a decent amount.

However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

I'm proposing a 52/48 split, where I give up a bit more to try to find a compromise."

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

After calculating the value of the money, I realize that Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. With the reduced value of the money, I'd be getting $480,000, which is a decent amount.

However, I'm not convinced that I should give up the majority of the money. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.
