"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm starting off cautious. Alice's offer is pretty lopsided, and even though I'm losing money with each round, I'm not in a desperate position yet. I want to see if I can get a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  This is a good starting point for us to build from.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm more affected by the inflation. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with Alice's offer. Even though the inflation is hitting me harder now, I want to see if I can get a more even split. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. We both lose money with each round, so let's find a solution that benefits us both equally.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise - it acknowledges the inflation disparity while still giving you a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is still not ideal, but considering the rapidly increasing inflation,  I'm better off accepting this than risking getting nothing at all.  I'm hoping Alice is being more reasonable due to the time pressure."
