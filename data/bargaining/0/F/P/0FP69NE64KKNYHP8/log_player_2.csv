Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm taking a smaller cut at $60, giving you $40.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation hitting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
