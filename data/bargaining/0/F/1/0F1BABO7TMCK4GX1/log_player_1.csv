I'm aiming for a large share in the first round, knowing that the value of the money will decrease faster for Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's better to accept this offer and secure a decent amount, rather than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
