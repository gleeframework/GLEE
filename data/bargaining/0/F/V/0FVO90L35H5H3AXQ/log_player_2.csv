"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is ""fair"" in the sense that it's a roughly even split, it's not the best for Bob considering the inflation. Bob is losing 10% of the value of the money each round, while Alice is only losing 5%.  It's worth seeing if Bob can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this round, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you think this is unfair.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be a bit higher. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept because the offer is getting worse each round, the offer still heavily favors Alice. It's worth pushing for a better split, even if the risk of getting nothing increases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time.  We're both losing value with each round, so a 50/50 split seems the fairest way to go.""} 
```"
