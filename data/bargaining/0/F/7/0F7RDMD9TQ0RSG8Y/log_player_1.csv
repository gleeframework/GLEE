I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I am the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500} 
```

I'm proposing a more even split this time.  While I still want a larger share, I recognize that Bob's counter-offer suggests he's not willing to accept a huge disparity. This proposal feels fair, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement."
