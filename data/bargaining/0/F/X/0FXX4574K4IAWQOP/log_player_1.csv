Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, given that I'm the one proposing first.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, taking 80% of the money is still a good deal considering the inflation.  Better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing at all!"
