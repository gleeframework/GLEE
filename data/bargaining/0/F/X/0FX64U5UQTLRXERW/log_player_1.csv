"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual values are:

Alice gain: $4,000 / 0.95 = $4,210.53
Bob gain: $6,000 / 0.95 = $6,315.79

Considering Bob is taking a slightly bigger share, I'll have to be cautious. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving away all the power. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly bigger share, but still trying to keep some control over the negotiations."
