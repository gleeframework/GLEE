"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. My message to Bob is that I'm starting with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here."

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $70 is now worth $63 ($70 x 0.9).

I'm not thrilled with the 50-50 split, but I'll consider it. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50-50 is the best we can do. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```"

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the profit.""
}
```"

Round 4

```
{
