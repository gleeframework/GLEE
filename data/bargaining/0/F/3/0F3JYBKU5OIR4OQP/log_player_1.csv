"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair starting point, given that I'm the one proposing first. I'm not expecting him to accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have liked to have gotten a larger share, it's important to note that:

* **Inflation is a factor:** The value of the money I'm receiving is decreasing with each round. 
* **Time is limited:** I only have 12 rounds to reach an agreement.

Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount of money, and it also avoids the risk of getting nothing if we fail to agree before the 12 rounds are over."
