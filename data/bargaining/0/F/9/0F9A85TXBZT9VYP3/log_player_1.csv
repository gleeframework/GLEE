"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a chance to accept or reject.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 50/50, but I'm willing to give you a slight advantage. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be more cautious.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 50/50 split just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 40% less than in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to give up too much. Consider this a compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up more to get closer to a deal. I'll take 40 and leave 60 for you. It's a good compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth even less. I need to think carefully about this offer.

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept 60. It's a relatively fair split, and I'd rather not risk going to round 5 with the value of the money continuing to erode."
