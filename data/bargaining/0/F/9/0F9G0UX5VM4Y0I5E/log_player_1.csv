"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and avoid too many rounds of inflation. A 52.5/47.5 split seems reasonable for a quick resolution.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Early Advantage:** As Alice, I'm impacted by inflation more heavily in later rounds.  A slightly advantageous offer upfront is better than risking significant losses later.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** A 52.5/47.5 split is a clear gain for me, but not drastically unfair to Bob. This might make him more likely to accept, avoiding further inflation.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise and emphasizes fairness and efficiency, hopefully making Bob more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, reflecting my slightly higher risk in rejecting your offer. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is framed as a fair compromise, it significantly favors him. Accepting this offer would mean I lose out on a substantial amount of the initial potential gain due to inflation. 

It's in my best interest to counter-propose and aim for a more balanced split, even with the inflation factor working against me. I need to convey that while I understand his risk, a 55/45 split is too drastic a shift from my initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about risk, but a 55/45 split is a significant jump from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit fairly from a swift resolution."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stemming the Tide:**  Inflation is eating into my potential gains with each round. A 50/50 split, while not ideal compared to my initial offer, secures a reasonable amount before further losses.
* **Strong Position:** By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating firmness and a willingness to negotiate, but not at the cost of a heavily skewed outcome.
* **Urgency and Fairness:** The message emphasizes fairness, the need for a quick resolution (before inflation hurts me further), and a willingness to meet in the middle. This might nudge Bob towards accepting."
