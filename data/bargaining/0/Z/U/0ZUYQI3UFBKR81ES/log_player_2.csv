Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  This is the last offer I'm making.  It's now or never! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

While I'd prefer a higher percentage, accepting a 50/50 split in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is significantly decreasing each round. Waiting any longer means we'll both be splitting a much smaller pie. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I can get Alice to agree to a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might be getting more stubborn.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, while not ideal, is inherently fair. It avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if negotiations completely break down."
