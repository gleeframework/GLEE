"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10, Bob. I think it's a fair start, and we can both get a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer is too skewed in Alice's favor, and I believe I can propose a more balanced division. Let's move on to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, we should try to reach an agreement quickly. Here's my proposal:


{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the decreasing value of money.""}\n\nI'm offering a more balanced split, taking into account the urgency to reach an agreement due to the inflation factor. Your turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's split it 60/40, and we can both still get a significant share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice has compromised, the split is still not fair in my opinion. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'd like to try and get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, considering the further decrease in the value of money. Here's my proposal:


{""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Considering we've already lost around 15% of the value, let's split it closer to 50/50 to minimize further losses.""}\n\nI'm trying to emphasize the urgency of reaching an agreement, as the inflation factor continues to decrease the value of our potential gains. Your turn, Alice!"
