"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000$ for me and 100,000$ for Bob. This gives me the majority of the money, but still allows Bob a decent share. I'm hoping this will be enough to get the game over in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is significantly more than he originally proposed, it is still a loss for me compared to what I proposed. I believe I can get a better deal if I continue the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed gain to 600,000$,  which is still a significant portion of the money. Since the value is decreasing faster for Bob, I believe this is a fair offer that might tempt him to accept, especially considering he's already experienced the consequences of rejecting a proposal."
