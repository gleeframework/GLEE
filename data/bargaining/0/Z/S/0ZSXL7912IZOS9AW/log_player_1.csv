"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60% of the $10,000 and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, 60-40 my way this time! ðŸ˜‰ 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my potential gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,800 in real value. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $6,000 is still worth $6,000 in real value.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since Bob is trying to flip the script and get the larger share. I'll have to think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation (5% from the previous round and another 5% this round), my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to be careful with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's compromise, I'll give you a slightly smaller share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting 55% of the $10,000 and Bob getting 45%."
