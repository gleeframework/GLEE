"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $6000, which is 60% of the total amount, and Bob would receive $4000, which is 40%. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and equality in the hopes that he would accept this division without feeling the need to negotiate further, especially considering that with each round, the value of the money decreases for me due to inflation. This initial offer aims to find a balance between maximizing my gain and minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round, where I would lose value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal, and we can avoid any potential losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, although the split is even and seems fair, I have to consider the impact of inflation on my gain. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in this round compared to the first round, accepting this offer would mean I'm actually getting less value than what it appears on the surface. Furthermore, we are only in Round 2, and I believe there is room for negotiation to potentially increase my share or find a more favorable division, considering the rounds left and the effect of inflation on my gains. Rejecting this offer allows me to proceed to the next round, where I can propose a division that might better account for the loss in value I'm experiencing due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose to take $5800 and Bob would receive $4200. Given that we are in Round 3 and the value of the money for me continues to decrease due to inflation, I aim to find a middle ground that is slightly more favorable to me than an even split but still appears reasonable and fair to Bob. The message ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground"" is an attempt to communicate the impact of inflation on my decision-making and to convey a sense of compromise, in the hopes that Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game before the value of the money decreases further for me. This approach balances the urgency of reaching an agreement with the need to maximize my gain under the constraints of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a little more to avoid further rounds and the risk of losing value due to inflation.  This deal still gives you a good amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing at the end. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI accept Bob's offer because, at this point, the impact of inflation on my potential gain is significant, with the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round. Given that we are already in Round 4 and the trend of offers does not strongly suggest I can significantly improve my share, accepting this offer seems prudent. Bob's message indicates a willingness to compromise to avoid further rounds, and his offer of $4800 to me, while less than what I initially proposed, is reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money for me. Continuing to reject offers risks leading to further rounds where the value of the money could decrease even more, potentially resulting in a worse outcome or even getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. Therefore, accepting this offer now seems like the best strategy to secure a tangible gain despite the initial aspirations for a higher share."
