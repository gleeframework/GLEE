I'm going to start with a pretty uneven split.  I'm confident Bob will want to negotiate and I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more money, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal than this.  It's a fair split and the inflation rate is pretty high."
