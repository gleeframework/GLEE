"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a fairly even split, with a slight bias towards myself to account for the fact that I'm making the first offer. I'll also include a friendly message to set a positive tone for the negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair split, but it's my turn to propose.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer for now. While it's a reasonable split, I'm not ready to give up the larger share just yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round and try to find a better deal. The inflation penalty is a consideration, but I think I can still do better than 45%. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to find a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. By offering 53% for myself and 47% for Bob, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both accept. The message ""Meet me in the middle?"" is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to consider this compromise. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's meet in the middle. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation penalty, which has reduced the value of the money I gain by 27.1% compared to the first round, I think it's time to accept Bob's offer. His proposal of 47% for me and 53% for him is a reasonable compromise, especially since he's framed it as his final offer. I don't want to risk losing everything by pushing for a better deal, so I'll accept this offer and end the game."
