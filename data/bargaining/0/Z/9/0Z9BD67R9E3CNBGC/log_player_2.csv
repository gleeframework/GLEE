Alice is toying with me! Even with inflation, her offer is barely budging. I need to stay firm."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice.  This is me trying to be reasonable. This offer gives you more than half, but we're running out of time and I'm losing money with every round.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Don't worry, I'll be reasonable too... for now 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is getting too risky.  The inflation is eating away at my potential gains. Accepting a 44/56 split now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
