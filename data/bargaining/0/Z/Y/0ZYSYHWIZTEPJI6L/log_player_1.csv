Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80, you get 20. That's a fair offer, right?

# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70, you get 30. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's better to accept this offer. While the inflation has devalued my share significantly, accepting this offer guarantees I get something, rather than risk getting nothing if we continue and Bob makes a better offer in the next round."
