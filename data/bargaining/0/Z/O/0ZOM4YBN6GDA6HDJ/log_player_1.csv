Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a negotiation, Alice. Let's find a middle ground. I propose a 52.5/47.5 split.

# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Bob is still pushing for a larger share. While a 52.5/47.5 split is getting closer to even, we're losing money to inflation each round.  It's time to push back a bit more firmly."
