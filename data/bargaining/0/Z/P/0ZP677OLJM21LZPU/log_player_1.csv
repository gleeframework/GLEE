Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I believe I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's split it 55/45. This ensures both of us get a good amount and avoids the risk of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
