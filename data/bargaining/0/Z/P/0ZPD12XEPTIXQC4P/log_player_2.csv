Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my decreasing returns due to inflation.  While her offer is slightly better than her previous one, she knows time is on her side.  I need to hold firm and hope she starts taking my position seriously before the inflation eats away too much of my potential gain."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know time is running out, but I still think I can get a slightly better deal. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the inflation is rapidly eroding my position.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything significantly better at this point, and waiting any longer risks getting a much worse deal in later rounds. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all."
