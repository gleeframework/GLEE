"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a balanced division""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's try a more even split this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 40-60 split is a good deal for me, considering the money I gain is worth 10% less now. I was hoping for a better split, especially since Bob's gain remains the same. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still need a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this one, but I'm still willing to negotiate further if needed."
