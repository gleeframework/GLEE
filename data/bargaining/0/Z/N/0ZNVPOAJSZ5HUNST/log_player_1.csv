"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the initial $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I propose a 50/50 split.  This is the best way to start off the game. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable proposal, and I'm willing to accept it."
