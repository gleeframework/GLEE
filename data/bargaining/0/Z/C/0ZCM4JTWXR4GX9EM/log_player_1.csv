"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly than Bob!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to meet in the middle, as the inflation has reduced my potential gain, and I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still need a decent share.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take $5,500 and leave $4,500 for Bob, trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on me now!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the effects of inflation. I'll take $5,200 and Bob will take $4,800. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking an even worse outcome due to further inflation."
