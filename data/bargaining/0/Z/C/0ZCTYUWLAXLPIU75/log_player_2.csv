Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 420000

```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. While ideally, I'd like a larger share, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice for a few reasons:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Each round, the value of my potential gain decreases substantially. Waiting any longer means accepting even less.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is clearly content to wait me out, knowing the pressure is on me due to inflation. Her offers are unlikely to get better. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees me $420,000 (though its real value is diminished due to the rounds passed). Rejecting means risking getting even less in future rounds, with no guarantee Alice will be more generous."
