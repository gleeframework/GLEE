Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, Bob's offer doesn't account for the impact of inflation on his end. I'm not losing any value from the money, so I should aim for a slightly better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
