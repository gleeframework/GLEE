"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split.  Accept this and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to make a deal that's similar to my initial offer, but with the roles reversed. However, I'm not convinced that 60/40 is fair, especially considering the inflation factor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Considering the 20% decrease in value for me and the 10% decrease for Bob, I'll aim for a more favorable split. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This way, we both get a decent share. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```"
