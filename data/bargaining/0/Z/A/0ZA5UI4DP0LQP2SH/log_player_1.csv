"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 dollars and Bob getting 400,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 50-50 split, I'll take it. My gain of 500,000 dollars is still worth the same as in the first round, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the value of my potential gain decreasing further due to inflation.
