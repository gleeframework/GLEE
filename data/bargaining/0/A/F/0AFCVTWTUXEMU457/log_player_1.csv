"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly opening offer, hoping to set a positive tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, reflecting my role as the proposer this round. Let's see if we can reach an agreement! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to flip the split in his favor!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll calculate the actual gains:

* My gain: 4000 / 0.95 (5% less due to inflation) = 4210.53
* Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.9 (10% less due to inflation) = 6666.67

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, considering the inflation effect:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share this round.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm taking 42% of the current value of the money, and leaving 58% for Bob. My message is a gentle nudge, trying to find a mutually acceptable agreement."
