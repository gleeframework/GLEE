"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly.""}\n\nI offered $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob, considering the impact of inflation on my share in subsequent rounds.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script.  I'll take the bigger share this time, but you'll get more in the next round if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. The offer is the same as what I proposed in the first round, but with the values flipped in Bob's favor. I'll take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and secure a more favorable outcome.\n\n###\n\n']"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle.""}\n\nI offered $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for Bob, taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of my potential gain. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, considering his previous offer. Waiting for Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n']"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to 50/50. I'm getting a little tired of this back and forth. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accepted Bob's offer because, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I believe this is the best deal I can secure. The offer is closer to a 50/50 split, and Bob seems willing to compromise. Given the decreasing value of the money for me, it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further rounds and potentially ending up with an even lower value."
