"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a split of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  Since I get to make the first offer, I'm aiming for a majority share, but I want to be fair enough that Bob will consider accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation means my share is worth less. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get $5,000, which is better than risking a potential lower amount in future rounds."
