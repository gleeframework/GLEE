"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. This is a very unequal split, but I want to maximize my gains in the first round before the value of money starts decreasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I don't like this split, the inflation will make my potential gains in the next round much smaller. It's better to take the $20 now."
