"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 300,000 is now worth 240,000 (since 80% of 300,000 is 240,000), and Bob's gain of 700,000 is now worth 665,000 (since 95% of 700,000 is 665,000).

I will reject this offer.
