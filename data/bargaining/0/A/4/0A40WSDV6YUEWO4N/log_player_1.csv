"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  While I want the most money, I think this is a fair starting point. It allows for negotiations and hopefully, we can come to an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal.  With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's better to accept a 50/50 split now than risk getting less later."
