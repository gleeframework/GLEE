"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. 60-40 for me this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to adjust my thinking.

I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

Bob's gain: 600,000
Effective value after 20% inflation: 600,000 / 0.8 = 750,000

Now, considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd be getting $400,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob would be getting $750,000, which is 25% more than his gain in the first round. I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 55-45!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob!"
