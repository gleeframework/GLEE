I'm offering Bob a small share to start, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer considering inflation.  It's better to take half now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
