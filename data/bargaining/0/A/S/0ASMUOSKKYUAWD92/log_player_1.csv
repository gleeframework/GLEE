"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation eating away at my potential earnings, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering Bob a relatively small share, but I think I can get away with it given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential earnings now.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer from Round 4... Given the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to be more cautious and accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
