# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being reasonable.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn and the clock is ticking.  I'll take a little less this round, but we need to settle this soon. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, especially more so for Alice, I think I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round.
### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing impact of inflation, I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the devaluing money, especially for Alice. I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself while still trying to be reasonable and attractive to Alice, given the time pressure and the devaluing money.
### {""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Time is ticking, and inflation is biting. Let's settle with a bit more for me this round!""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and call it a day before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Given the significant impact of inflation, especially on Alice's side, I believe I can push for a better deal in the next round. An even split at this point doesn't account for the future devaluation we'll both face if we don't settle soon.
### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the substantial effect of inflation on both our potential gains, especially Alice's, I'll make an offer that acknowledges this but still tries to maximize my take. Since Alice suggested an even split last round, I'll slightly adjust my offer in my favor, hoping the pressure of time and inflation will make it more acceptable.
### {""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the heavy inflation, I'll take a bit more. It's better we settle now before it's worth even less!""}"
