"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you less, but I'm not going to give up all the power! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of 400,000 is actually worth 380,000 in real terms. I'm not thrilled about the power imbalance, but I'll consider the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much control. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and keeping some control for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a firmer stance, Alice. You're going to have to give up more if you want me to accept. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 300,000 is actually worth 257,400 in real terms. I'm not thrilled about giving up even more, but I need to consider the fact that the money is worth less and less with each passing round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up that much more, Bob. I'm trying to find a balance between giving you a decent share and keeping some value for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up as much as Bob's previous offer."
