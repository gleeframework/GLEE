"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair split in round 1, I can potentially get a better deal later since the inflation will hurt Alice more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time.  With inflation, it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share considering I'm not affected by inflation 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While Alice is offering a compromise, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a larger portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money 40/60. I'm willing to give you a slight advantage to avoid further delays and the potential for a worse deal later.""}
