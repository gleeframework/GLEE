"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 600,000 and Bob will take 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We can both maximize our share this way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, as I was hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept it."
