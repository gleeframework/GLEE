 I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer. I want to see how Bob reacts.  Hopefully, he'll accept, and we can both get a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'm getting less than I initially proposed, it's still a decent split and we both get a good amount.  It's better than risking further inflation and possibly ending up with nothing."
