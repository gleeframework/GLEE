"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 30%. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid wasting time and risking inflation."
