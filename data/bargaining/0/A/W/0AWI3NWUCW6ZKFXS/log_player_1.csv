I'm going to start by being generous and offering Bob a small share.  I'll see if he's willing to accept this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While the money I gain is worth less because of inflation, it's still more than 10% of the total. I'm willing to wait and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split this time, considering that Bob's offer was very unfair and that inflation is affecting both of us. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."
