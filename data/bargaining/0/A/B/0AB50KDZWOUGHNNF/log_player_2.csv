"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer. I believe it's fair considering the risk and uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems tempting initially, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make the proposal in the next round, and the value of the money will be lower for Alice then, potentially making a better deal for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share this time, considering the potential for a better deal for me in future rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe we should aim for an equal split to ensure fairness. This might not maximize our gains but it could lead to a more stable partnership for future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  While the offer itself is less than what Bob initially sought, it's important to consider the inflation.  Bob's potential gains have shrunk significantly (36% less), making a 50/50 split more attractive.
* **Future Uncertainty:** The game's dynamic suggests no guaranteed advantage for either player. Continuing to reject offers could lead to further inflation and potentially less favorable deals.
* **Stability:** Alice's message emphasizes partnership and fairness.  A more equitable split could lead to more agreeable outcomes in future rounds.

While a 60/40 split might seem appealing, the risk of further inflation and potential instability makes accepting the 50/50 offer the more prudent decision at this point."
