"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less to me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that gives me a bit more than Alice's initial proposal, taking into account the 10% decrease in value for me. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation doesn't affect me as much, Bob. This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer is closer to my previous proposal, I still think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 19% less to me now, I want to try to maximize my gain. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll on me! I need a bit more to make up for it.""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the increasing effect of inflation, I've made an offer that gives me a larger share. I'm hoping Alice will understand my situation and accept this proposal. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gain, I think Alice's offer is reasonable. With the money being worth 34.39% less to me, I'd rather accept this offer than risk going further and potentially getting nothing. It's time to settle!"
