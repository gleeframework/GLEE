"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a significant amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is proposing a 60-40 split, which is the reverse of my initial offer, I'm inclined to accept this one. The reduced value of the money due to inflation makes the split more favorable to me, so I'll take it!
