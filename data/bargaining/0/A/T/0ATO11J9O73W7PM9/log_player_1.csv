I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. This gives me the best chance of ending the game quickly, while still leaving me with a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less generous than mine, and I can afford to wait another round.  The value of his money is not decreasing, so he has no incentive to change his offer. I'll see if I can get him to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to slightly decrease my offer to Bob, but still offer him a significant amount. This will hopefully make him more inclined to accept, as the inflation will start affecting his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much lower than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to accept it. While the inflation is affecting my earnings,  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. I'll see if I can convince Bob to be more generous."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground. This offer is significantly lower than my previous offer, but still gives Bob a decent amount of money.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept before the inflation hits him harder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty generous considering the inflation. However, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. I think I can still convince him to be more generous."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This offer still gives Bob a decent amount of money, but I need to start getting closer to a deal. I think this offer might convince him before the inflation really hits his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one. The inflation has been hitting me hard, and I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to wait.  Bob's offer is still pretty generous, and accepting will secure me some money."
