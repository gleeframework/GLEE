"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. Since I have the advantage in terms of inflation, I'm going to try to secure the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems tempting now, the value of the money I'm getting will drastically decrease in the coming rounds, especially compared to Bob's offer. I have a better chance at getting a more even split in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to offer a more even split this time. While I'm still at a disadvantage with inflation, I think a fairer offer will increase the likelihood of Bob accepting and prevent further rounds with potentially even worse deals for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. The value of the money I'm getting is significantly less than the initial offer, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is working against me, but I need to hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  Inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both losing value with each passing round, and that a fair split is the best way to maximize our gains."
