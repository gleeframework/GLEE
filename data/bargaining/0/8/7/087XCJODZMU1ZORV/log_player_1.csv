"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This way, I'll get a decent chunk of the money, and Bob will still get a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. Considering the inflation, I'll get 5000 dollars, but it's worth 20% less than the 6000 I could have gotten in the first round. However, the 5000 Bob is offering is worth 5% less than the 4000 he could have gotten in the first round, which is a relatively smaller decrease. I'll accept this offer. 

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
