"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and simple way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still want to keep more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I need to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept the offer for now, hoping to do better in future rounds.
