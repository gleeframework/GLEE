"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves a bit more, huh?

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than the 50/50 split I proposed earlier, since I get 40% of the original amount, which is more than the 50% I initially offered.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
