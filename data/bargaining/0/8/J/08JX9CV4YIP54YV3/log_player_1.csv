Let's see if Bob is happy with a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm aiming for a big chunk of the money, but I'm also taking into account the inflation factor.  If he rejects, we'll see what he proposes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation. Accepting ensures I get something and avoids the risk of a worse offer in the next round."
