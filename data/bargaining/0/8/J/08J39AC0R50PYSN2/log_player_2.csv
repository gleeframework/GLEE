"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000, you get $4,000.  We can avoid losses from inflation if we settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too greedy, Alice. Let's split it a bit more fairly -  I'll take $5,500 and you can have $4,500.  We should settle this quickly before inflation eats away at our potential earnings.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. My turn now, and I'm feeling generous. $5,800 for me, $4,200 for you.  This is a good deal considering inflation is already eating into our potential profit. Don't be stubborn. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation by offering slightly more than her previous offer, but still keeping the lion's share. It's worth taking a small hit from inflation to negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a more balanced deal: $5,200 for me and $4,800 for you.  Let's be sensible and avoid further losses due to inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need you to meet me halfway.  $5,600 for me, $4,400 for you. We're losing serious money with each round, let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further significant losses from inflation. The longer we wait, the less we both get. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount rather than risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
