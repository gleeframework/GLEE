"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 20%. This is a generous offer, considering the high stakes and the risk of inflation. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. A 50/50 split might be a good opportunity to split the remaining value of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer and we'll split the remaining $1,000,000 in half."
