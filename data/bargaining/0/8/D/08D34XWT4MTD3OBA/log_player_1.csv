"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I would get $6,000 and Bob would get $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 60-40, with me getting the larger share this time.  It's only fair, considering you got the better deal in the last round.  Let's end this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the idea of Bob getting the larger share, but I do want to end the game soon. I'll think carefully about this offer...
