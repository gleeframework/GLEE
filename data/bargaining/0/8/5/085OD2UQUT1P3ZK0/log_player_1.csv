"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90% to me and 10% to you, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to accept it, as it's a fair and equal split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll get $5,000, which is 10% less than the $5,500 I would have gotten in the first round."
