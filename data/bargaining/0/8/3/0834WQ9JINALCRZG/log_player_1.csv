"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer. The split is too even, and I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Since the money is worth less, I'll need to be more aggressive in my negotiation.

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's a 40% share, and I'd rather take it than risk waiting for another round.
