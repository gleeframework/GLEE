Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 40% now, you can get 60% if you accept. It's a good start, but I think we can do better. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject the offer. While it's better than what I was offered before, it's still too early to settle. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm. Let's try 70/30. This is a good compromise, and we can both get a decent amount of money.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 32% now, you can get 68% if you accept. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I'm getting a better deal than in your offer. 
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has been significant, I'm taking into account that we have limited rounds and the money will continue to devalue.  Bob's offer provides a good amount of money considering the inflation, and it seems like a good opportunity to secure a decent deal."
