"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to consider the effects of inflation. Since my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

Initially, I was offered $600,000, but due to inflation, it's now worth 95% of its original value, which is $570,000.

Bob's offer is $500,000, which is 20% less than his original gain of $400,000, but it's still a decent amount.

Considering the inflation, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the effects of inflation in mind, I'll make a new offer. Since my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the erosion of value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
