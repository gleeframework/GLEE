"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous offer for me.  I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. While Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor, it's the first round and I have time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This offer recognizes the time pressure on you with the higher discount rate. Let's close this deal and both benefit.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your attempt to reach an agreement.  However, I believe we can still find a split that's more beneficial for both of us.  Let's work towards a more equitable solution. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid devaluation of her share. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away to get a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, especially for you. This is my final offer - let's be done with this.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the pressure of time, but I'm still not comfortable with such an uneven split. This offer reflects a more balanced approach, considering our respective discount rates.  Let's find common ground and avoid losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is finally in a reasonable range, even with the devaluation. Accepting ensures we both walk away with something.  Holding out for a significantly better deal is too risky at this stage."
