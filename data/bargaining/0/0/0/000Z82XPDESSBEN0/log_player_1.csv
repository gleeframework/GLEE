"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a very aggressive opening offer, but it maximizes my gain in the first round. If Bob rejects, the money will be worth less to him in the next round, making him more likely to accept a similar offer then."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still quite unfair, even with the inflation affecting him more.  I'll reject and see if he'll be willing to compromise more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. This offer is more balanced than the first one and I'm hoping that Bob will be more likely to accept it as the inflation continues to devalue his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still holding out for a very large share. I will reject his offer again, hoping he'll realize that he needs to compromise more to get any money at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm offering Bob a more significant share this time, hoping to encourage him to accept. The inflation is hitting him hard, and I want to ensure we both get something before it's too late."
