"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and reasonable division.""}

I'm proposing that I get 700,000 and Bob gets 300,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable division, considering we're both starting with the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is more equitable, considering the value depreciation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 6:4 split, but I understand Bob's perspective.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise at 55:45. It's still a fair split, considering the inflation.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and offer a slightly more generous split than Bob's previous proposal."
