"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'm not as eager to give up 60. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55

```

I'm offering a slight increase in my share, but still trying to keep the game going to see if I can get an even better deal."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! With the money being worth significantly less, I'm getting more cautious. I'll accept Bob's offer this time, hoping to salvage what's left.
