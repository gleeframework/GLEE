Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the inflation we're facing.  It allows us both to get a decent share, and prevents things from getting too unbalanced. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
