"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way we both get a good amount and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not sure if he's taking into account the inflation factor.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd like to adjust my proposal to account for that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a higher amount for myself to compensate for the inflation. How about 600000 for me and 400000 for you?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will consider the inflation factor and adjust his offer accordingly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, and it's worth 5% less for Bob, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will take into account the changing value of the money and make a more competitive offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to reflect the inflation, but I think a 45/55 split is a fair compromise. We can end this now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be generous, but I'm not sure if 45/55 is the best deal for me, considering the inflation.

Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me now, I'd like to take a closer look at the offer. However, I'm not convinced that 45/55 is the best compromise, especially considering the difference in inflation rates.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 50/50 split, considering the inflation rates. I think it's a more equitable distribution of the remaining value.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will consider my proposal and meet me in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me now, and it's worth 14.26% less for Bob, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's try to find a fair middle ground?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will take into account the changing value of the money and make a more competitive offer in the next round."
