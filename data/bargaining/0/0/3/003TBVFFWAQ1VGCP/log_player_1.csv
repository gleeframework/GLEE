Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping to get Bob to accept. He might be willing to take a smaller share rather than risk getting nothing if we keep going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm not going to risk getting nothing. A 50/50 split is fair and guarantees me at least something."
