"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but that offer is too low for me.  Let's be more realistic. I propose 70/30.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. How about 75/25? Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, time is working against me more than it is against her. I need to push for a more significant gain in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""We need to settle this soon, Alice.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's a strong offer and gives you a fair share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate. Let's go for 60/40. We're running out of time, so let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The effects of inflation are becoming severe. While I'd prefer a 55/45 split, accepting 60/40 now is better than risking further losses due to inflation or walking away with nothing if we fail to agree."
