"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a relatively small share, but I'm trying to be generous to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'm actually getting $475,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but it's a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
