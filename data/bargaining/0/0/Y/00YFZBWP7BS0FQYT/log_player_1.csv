"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 

I propose Alice gets $9000 and Bob gets $1000.  I want to start with a relatively fair offer, but with a slight advantage for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is being greedy! I'll reject his offer and see what he proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'll lower my share slightly to 8000, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I think Bob might be getting a little greedy, so I'll see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is definitely getting more stubborn. I won't accept this unfair offer. I'll try to find a better compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 7000. We're running out of time, so I need to find a solution that Bob might accept.  Hopefully, he'll see that we need to compromise to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still holding out for a larger share. I'm not going to accept this offer - it's getting ridiculous. I'll try to find a more balanced solution in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to make one final offer to try and reach a compromise. We're running out of time and I'm willing to take a smaller share if it means we can both get something.  This is a 60/40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering Bob's recent proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being unreasonable!  He's just mirroring my last offer, but reversed. I refuse to accept this.  There's still a chance for us to reach an agreement, but we need to find a more balanced solution in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're running out of time and this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to split the money evenly, but Bob needs to accept it if we both want to get anything.  I hope he's finally ready to compromise."
