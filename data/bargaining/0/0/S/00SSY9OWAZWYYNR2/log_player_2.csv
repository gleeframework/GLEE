Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll aim to get a larger share to make up for the loss. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, Alice's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept it.
