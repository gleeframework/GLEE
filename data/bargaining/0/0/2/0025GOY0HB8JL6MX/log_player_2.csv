Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is lowering her demand, but it's still early in the game.  We can afford to hold out for a bit longer and see if she'll concede more."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be real, Alice. This is the fairest deal. Take it before inflation eats away even more of your share."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to offer an even split.  This puts the pressure on Alice. She's been consistently lowering her demand, showing she's willing to compromise. By offering an even split, we're demonstrating fairness while highlighting the shrinking pot due to inflation, which primarily affects her. This might be our last chance for a clean, equal split before we have to push for a more aggressive advantage."
