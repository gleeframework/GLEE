"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I can see that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share.

I'll reject this offer. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60% of the total, and my offer in round 1 was 50%, I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach this time. Here's my new proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This way, I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, I can see that Bob is trying to take advantage of the increasing inflation to get an even bigger share.

However, his offer is still relatively close to equal, and I'm not sure if I want to risk waiting for a better offer. I'll accept this offer.
