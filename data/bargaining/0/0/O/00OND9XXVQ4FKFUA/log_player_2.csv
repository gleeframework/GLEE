Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Although the offer is only slightly better than the first round, considering the inflation, it's likely that Alice will keep rejecting and the money will keep losing value. It's better to take what I can get."
