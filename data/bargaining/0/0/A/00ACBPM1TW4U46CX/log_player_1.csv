"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and taking 60 dollars for myself. I've included a message suggesting that this is a fair division, in the hopes that Bob will accept and we can conclude the game quickly. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering Bob a smaller share. However, I'm still offering him a significant amount, as I want to incentivize him to accept the offer rather than risking further rounds where the money will lose value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This offer won't be as good in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although he's trying to be generous, I believe I can get a better deal, especially since the money doesn't lose value for me. I'm hoping that in future rounds, Bob will be more willing to compromise and offer me a larger share, as the money will continue to lose value for him. By rejecting this offer, I'm taking a risk, but I think it's worth it to potentially get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the bigger share""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob a slightly larger share than in my initial proposal, but still less than what he offered me in the previous round. I'm trying to appear willing to compromise, while still taking advantage of the fact that the money doesn't lose value for me. I'm hoping that Bob will be more willing to accept this offer, as the money will continue to lose value for him in future rounds. My message is designed to convey a sense of flexibility, while still being firm in my desire for the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's split this evenly. It's the fairest deal and the clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer of an even split. While Bob is trying to appeal to fairness, I believe I can still get a better deal due to the asymmetry in how the money's value changes for us. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have an advantage in negotiations. I'm willing to risk further rounds to try and get more than half, knowing that the pressure of the money losing value will increasingly be on Bob. By rejecting this offer, I'm pushing Bob into a corner, hoping he'll be more desperate and willing to compromise more in the next rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going below this""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than in my previous proposal, but still more than what he would have gotten from an even split. My message is designed to convey that I'm being generous, but also firm in my position. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is losing value for Bob, and I'm hoping that he'll accept this offer rather than risking further losses. By saying I'm not going below this, I'm attempting to create a sense of finality and pressure Bob into accepting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a compromise, Alice.  We're running out of time, and the deal is getting worse for both of us every round. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer again. Although he's framing this as a compromise and emphasizing the time pressure, I still believe I can get a better deal. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'm not feeling the same pressure as Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get more. Bob's offer of 52-48 is closer to an even split, but I'm hoping to take advantage of his increasing desperation and get an even better deal in future rounds. By rejecting this offer, I'm continuing to push Bob to make concessions and compromise more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than in my previous proposal, but still less than what he offered me in the previous round. My message is designed to convey a sense of finality and ultimatum, trying to pressure Bob into accepting the deal. I'm hoping that Bob will feel the pressure of the money losing value and the limited number of rounds left, and will accept this offer rather than risking further losses. By saying it's my final offer, I'm attempting to create a sense of urgency and force Bob's hand."
