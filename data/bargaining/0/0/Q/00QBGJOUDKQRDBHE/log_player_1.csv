"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%. This way, I'll get a larger share, but it's a relatively fair split to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation, so I need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is 60% of the remaining amount, I'll consider it carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
