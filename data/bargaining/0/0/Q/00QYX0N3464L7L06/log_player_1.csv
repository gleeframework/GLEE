"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which gives me 6000 and leaves 4000 for Bob. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60-40, I'll give you 70-30, is that a fair trade? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 70-30 is a fair trade, considering I was willing to give you 40% in the first round. I'm willing to negotiate, but 70-30 is too generous for Bob. I'll reject this offer and make a new one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway between 60-40 and 70-30. How about 65-35?""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
