"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 3:2. This offers a fair compromise while considering the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should reject this offer. While it seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation factor, Bob is getting a worse deal each round. It's better to wait and see if Alice offers a better deal in the next round, as her money will be worth less then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I believe a 6:4 split is more fair, considering the inflation factor. This way we both get a good amount, and it's more beneficial for me in the long run."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's aim for an equal split. This ensures fairness and prevents any potential future regrets due to perceived unfairness. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob should accept this offer. While Bob's gain remains the same, Alice's gain is significantly less due to inflation. This means that Bob is getting a better deal than in the previous rounds. An equal split is a fair compromise in this situation, and accepting it ensures a guaranteed outcome."
