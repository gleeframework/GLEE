"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose that I receive $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000. This gives me the majority of the money while still giving Bob a small share.  Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. I lose a significant amount of money due to inflation, and Bob's offer is the only way to guarantee I get anything at all."
