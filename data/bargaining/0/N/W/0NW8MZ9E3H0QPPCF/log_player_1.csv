"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'm actually getting $4000 in this round.

I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, as it would leave me with a smaller share overall. But I also don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting my next offer.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
