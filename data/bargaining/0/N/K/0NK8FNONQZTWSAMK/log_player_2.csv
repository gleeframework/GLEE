"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, the total amount is now 9,000$ (10,000 * 0.9). I'll make a proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the total amount is now 8,100$ (10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9). The money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, so it's 3200$ (4000 * 0.8). Alice's offer is:

# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than what I proposed in round 2, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.
