"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a small share to get something at least."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While it's a significant increase from the previous round, the inflation hit my potential earnings hard. I'm not ready to settle for such a small share just yet. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split, but still favoring myself due to the inflation. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer. While it's a better split than the last round, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of what I'm gaining. I'm still not ready to settle for such a small share. There's a good chance I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share than the previous round, but I'm still confident that Bob will find it more appealing than the last few offers. I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a decent amount and avoiding further rounds of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the inflation hitting hard, I can't accept such an uneven split. I'm still hoping for a more balanced outcome.  The potential for a better offer in the next round outweighs the risk of further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split, a bit more even than the previous round. Inflation is getting serious, and I need to secure a decent share before the value drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not ready to accept such an uneven split, even with the increasing inflation.  I'm hoping for a more balanced outcome and believe there's still a chance for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With inflation taking a heavy toll, I'm going for a 50/50 split. It's the most balanced I can offer at this point, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in settling for a fair share before further inflation erodes our gains."
