# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the rapid devaluation of the money, especially for me, accepting this offer seems like the best option to secure a reasonable amount before the value drops further."
