"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This seems like a fair deal to me, as we both benefit from ending the game early. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate will affect us both differently.  Let's end the game now and avoid further losses.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. How about 58/42? It's a slightly better deal for me than your offer, and it still allows us both to walk away with a decent amount before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take the deal, I'm not sure I can get a better offer and inflation is hitting hard!"
