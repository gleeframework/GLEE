"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate will affect us both differently.  Let's end the game now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
