"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth 90% of what I would have gotten in the first round, which is a significant decrease. However, I'm still getting a substantial amount.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

For now, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a new proposal that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous this time, but still keeping in mind that the money is worth less than it was initially. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway and propose a 50/50 split. It's time to make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth only about 50.9% of what I would have gotten in the first round, which is a significant decrease. However, I'm getting a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer considering the circumstances.

I think it's time to accept the offer and end the game:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
