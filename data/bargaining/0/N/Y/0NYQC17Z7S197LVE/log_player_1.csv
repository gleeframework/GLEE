Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm only losing 5% per round while Bob loses 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation and the fact that Bob gets to propose next round."
