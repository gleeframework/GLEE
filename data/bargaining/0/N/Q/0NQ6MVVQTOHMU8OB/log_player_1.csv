"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

However, I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less from round 1 to round 2, and another 20% less from round 2 to round 3), I'll make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, the money's losing value fast!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this time, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

However, I'm still not convinced that Bob's offer is the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 88.8% of its original value (100% - 20% - 20% - 48.8%), I'll make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a tiny share, but I'm not giving in 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth only 32.77% of its original value now (100% - 20% - 20% - 48.8% - 67.23%). I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

While Bob's offer is still a relatively small share, I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.
