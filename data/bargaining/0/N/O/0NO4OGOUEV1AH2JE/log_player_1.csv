I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less to me, I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering a more balanced split, but still ensuring a good portion for myself. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is still substantial for me, I'm going to reject it. The inflation is starting to hit hard, but I'm holding out for a better deal. I'm still in a strong position to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is making things tough, but I'm going to try for a 50/50 split. It's the fairest offer I can make, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept it."
