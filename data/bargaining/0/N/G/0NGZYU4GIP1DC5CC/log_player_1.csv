"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
