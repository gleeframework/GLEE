"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems reasonable at first glance, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal for myself. The inflation disadvantage for Alice is higher, so I'm confident I can push for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  We both lose less to inflation this way.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want to split fairly, but the inflation hits me harder. I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to affect my potential gains significantly. I'll accept Alice's offer, as it's still better than potentially getting nothing in later rounds."
