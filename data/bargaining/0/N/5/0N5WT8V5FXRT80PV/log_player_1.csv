"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you take 20.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm giving you a relatively small portion, hoping you'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's fair, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob is offering an even split, I'll consider it a decent option. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
