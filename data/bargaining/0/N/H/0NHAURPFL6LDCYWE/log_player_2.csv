"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer is the most beneficial for both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this offer is more fair, considering the inflation we both face.  We can end this quickly and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, Bob, but your last offer was too low.  This is a compromise that still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer my previous offer, this is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation."
