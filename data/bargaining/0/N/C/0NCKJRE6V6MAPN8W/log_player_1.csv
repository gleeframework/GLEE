"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point. We both get a decent amount, and it gives us room to negotiate in the future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor, even with the inflation factored in. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more equitable starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
