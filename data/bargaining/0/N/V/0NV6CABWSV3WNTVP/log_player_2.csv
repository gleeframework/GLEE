Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'm more affected by inflation in this game.

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""bob_gain"": 650000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. Let's be fair to both of us and split the money evenly. This is the most rational solution considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
