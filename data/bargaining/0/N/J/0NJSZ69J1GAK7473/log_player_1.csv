# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is a bit better, but I'm still not satisfied. With inflation, the money is worth less, so I want to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm increasing my share to $65, and offering Bob $35. Let's see if he accepts this one!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think I'm getting close to my limit 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $55 for me and $45 for him. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
