"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk to keep things interesting.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. The message is a friendly way of framing the offer, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's a good starting point and accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. That seems like the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $4,000
* Bob gain: $4,000

I like the idea of splitting it evenly, so I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
