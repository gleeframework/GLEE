"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, and I'll take $7,000 for myself. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we're both starting with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $7,000 from the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd be getting $5,600 if I accepted Bob's offer. Since his offer is $4,000, which is more than the 80% of $5,000 (the original $7,000 minus the $2,000 I would have given to Bob in the first round), I'll accept this offer.
