"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty aggressive start, but I figure Bob might be willing to take a small share to avoid the risk of getting nothing if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing in the next round due to inflation."
