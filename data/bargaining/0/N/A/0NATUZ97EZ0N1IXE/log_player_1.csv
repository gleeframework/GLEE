"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $40 instead of $50.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too keen on giving him a larger share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again due to inflation, my gain is now worth 40% of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, which should give me a slightly larger share than before, considering the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm holding firm on my share, but I'm willing to give you a bit more this time! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 52.2% of the original amount ($100 x 0.482 = $48.20). Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not comfortable with giving him a 70% share.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less again due to inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of the original amount ($100 x 0.512 = $51.20).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is closer to the original 50-50 split, but still takes into account the inflation effect."
