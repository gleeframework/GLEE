"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider the new values.

My offer was $6,000 for me and $4,000 for Bob in the first round, which is now equivalent to $4,800 for me and $3,600 for Bob.

Bob's offer is $5,000 for both of us, which is less than my previous offer, but more than Bob's previous offer.

I'll accept this offer.
