"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair to keep most of the money as I'm the one making the offer. But, I'm willing to share a small amount with you. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI don't think it's fair that Alice gets to keep 90% of the money just because she made the offer. I think we should split it more evenly. I'm willing to listen to her reasoning, but I'm not going to accept such an unfair offer. Bring on the next round!"

# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI think splitting it down the middle is indeed the fairest option. I'm glad Alice came around to seeing it that way. I'm happy to accept this offer and end the game on a fair note!"
