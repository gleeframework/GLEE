"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, my proposal from the first round is now less attractive.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 50-50 split is the best option, especially considering the initial amount of $1,000,000. I'd like to aim for a higher share to account for the inflation and the risk of future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, aiming for a 60-40 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than our previous offers. Let's compromise and move towards a more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less due to inflation, my proposal from the third round is even less attractive.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially since I'm aiming for a higher share to account for the significant inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a better share to account for inflation. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 65-35 split in my favor, taking into account the significant decrease in value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting closer. I'm willing to give up a bit more, but we need to find a balance. Let's talk. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 40.95% less due to inflation, my proposal from the fifth round is now even less attractive.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55-45 split, as I'm still hoping for a better share to account for the significant inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit anxious about the time running out. I'll make one last push for a better share.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 70-30 split in my favor, taking into account the significant inflation and the fact that we're running out of time. This is my last chance to make a strong offer."
