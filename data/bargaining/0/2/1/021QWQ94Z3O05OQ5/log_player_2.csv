"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I get $60, you get $40. This seems fair considering the inflation and the fact that we could both walk away with nothing if we don't agree. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's getting risky for both of us now. I'll meet you halfway between our offers last round, but that's my final offer.  Let's close this deal before inflation eats away at the value even more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
