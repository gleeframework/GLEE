Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. This is my final offer. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Waiting any longer will result in an even smaller share, even if Bob were to offer a slightly better split.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has labeled this as his ""final offer.""  There's a strong chance he won't budge further, and rejecting this offer might lead to an even worse outcome in a later round.
* **Current Offer:** Accepting 700,000$ is still a significant sum, even with the inflation. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk ending up with a much smaller share later."
