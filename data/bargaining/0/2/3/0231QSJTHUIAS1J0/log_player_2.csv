"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. It's fair, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's risky to accept a 40/60 split so early in the game. There's a chance that Alice is being too aggressive, and I might be able to get a better deal later on. I'll see what she proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a more even split. I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I think we can both do better than a 40/60 split. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair given the current situation and the risk of further inflation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk further inflation. Accepting now ensures I get at least half the money, which is better than potentially getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
