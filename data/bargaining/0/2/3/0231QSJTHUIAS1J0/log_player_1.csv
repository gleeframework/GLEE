Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more even split. I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I think we can both do better than a 40/60 split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
