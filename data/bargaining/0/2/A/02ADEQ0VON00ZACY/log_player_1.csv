"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm hoping for more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing with each round!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67 (Alice's gain)
* 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44 (Bob's gain)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll try to make a counteroffer. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Consider this a fair offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller amount this time, but I'm still hoping he'll accept and we can end the game soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* 5000 / 0.7273 = 6884.31 (Alice's gain)
* 5000 / 0.7273 = 6884.31 (Bob's gain)

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair. I'll accept this offer.
