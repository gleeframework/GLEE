"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a friendly note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not too thrilled about the 40-60 split. However, Bob's message suggests a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
