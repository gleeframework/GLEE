"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being somewhat generous to Bob, hoping he'll accept my offer and we can avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though inflation has reduced the value of the money, accepting this offer is the best strategy. If I reject, I get to make a proposal next round, but Bob will have lost even more due to inflation. This makes him less likely to accept my offer in the next round, and we risk the game continuing for a long time with ever-decreasing returns. Accepting the offer now secures a decent amount for me, and it's likely the best outcome given the circumstances."
