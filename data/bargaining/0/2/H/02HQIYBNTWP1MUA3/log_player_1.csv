Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer. I'm taking the majority share, but I'm still leaving Bob with something. This should encourage him to accept in the first round, but I'm willing to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While I'm not thrilled about the 1000 dollar gain, it's better than nothing. By rejecting, I keep the negotiation power and can make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my initial proposal, but still aiming for a decent share. With each round, Bob's money is worth less due to inflation, so I'm hoping he'll see the value in taking this offer."
