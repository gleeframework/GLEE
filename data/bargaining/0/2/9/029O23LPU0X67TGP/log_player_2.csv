Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this split is more equitable considering the inflation. Let's close the deal.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time here.  This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation but still giving me a slight advantage given the faster rate at which my potential gains decrease. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
