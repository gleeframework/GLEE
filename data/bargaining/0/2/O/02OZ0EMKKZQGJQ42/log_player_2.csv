Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we'll both be facing.  Let's get this done!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, that last offer was heavily skewed in your favor considering the inflation. This is my final offer - let's be reasonable and end this here. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is better than what I could potentially get in the next round. Let's call it a day!"
