"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to accept or reject.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll want to negotiate further and give me a better chance to get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 20% less, I'm effectively getting $42 (70 * 0.6) in the first round, and now I'm being offered $50, which is a 19% increase from the first round's effective amount. It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the even split, but I'm hoping for a bit more. Can you consider a slightly higher amount?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, hoping Bob will be willing to compromise.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 20% inflation, so I'm effectively offering Bob 48 dollars, which is a slight increase from the previous round's effective amount."
