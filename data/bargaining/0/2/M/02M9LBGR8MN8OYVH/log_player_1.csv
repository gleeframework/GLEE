"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $6,000 gain from the first round is now worth $4,800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it since I'd be giving up $1,800 ($6,000 - $4,200, which is 20% of $6,000) and only gaining $4,200. I'd rather try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation adjustment, my $4,800 gain from the second round is now worth $3,840 (20% less than $4,800).

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $5,500 gain from the third round is now worth $2,880 (48.8% less than $5,500).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to accept it since I'd be giving up $2,880 and gaining $4,000. It's a relatively fair deal, and I don't want to risk going to another round.
