Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45. This gives you a bigger share than the last round, and still leaves me with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the deal. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep rejecting offers, and this is a decent amount."
