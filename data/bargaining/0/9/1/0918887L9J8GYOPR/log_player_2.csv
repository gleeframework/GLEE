**Reasoning:**

The game is entering a critical stage. While Alice's offer is slightly better,  accepting now means losing out on potential gains if I hold out a little longer. Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but the inflation is the real enemy.  I need to push for a more significant share in the next round or two before the inflation eats away too much of my potential winnings."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. Don't let greed make us both losers!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and inflation is eating into my potential gains. While I'd prefer a larger share, holding out for much longer is too risky.  A 50/50 split is fair, and the message emphasizes the time pressure and the danger of walking away with nothing. This offer gives Alice a chance to take a guaranteed win and avoids the risk of the deal falling apart entirely."
