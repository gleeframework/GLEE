"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate more in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split for this round. Let's be reasonable - time is money, and it's losing value fast for both of us!""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to reduce my share to 60% this time. We're both losing money with each round, so we need to work together. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid inflation.  I need to push for a more equitable split before we run out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time!  This offer is my bottom line.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation working against us both.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand slightly from the previous round to signal firmness while still offering a reasonable split. By framing this offer as my ""bottom line,"" I'm hoping to add pressure on Alice to accept before the money devalues further."
