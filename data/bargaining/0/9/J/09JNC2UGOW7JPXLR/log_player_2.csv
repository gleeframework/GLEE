"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than the initial amount, it's now worth $8,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is now worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my calculation.

Initially, the money was worth $10,000. After 2 rounds of inflation, it's worth $8,000 x 0.8 x 0.9 = $5,760.

Alice's offer is 4500 + 5500 = $10,000, but since the total money is now worth $5,760, the actual amounts are 4500/10,000 x 5760 = $2592 for me and 5500/10,000 x 5760 = $3168 for Alice.

I'll accept this offer to get $2592, which is better than going into the next round with less money.
