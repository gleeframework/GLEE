"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Bob to encourage fairness. Please consider accepting this offer. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob should reject this offer.  While it's a good deal in the first round, the inflation will hurt Bob more than Alice in the future rounds. By rejecting, Bob gets to make the next proposal and can aim for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging your initial offer.  This split is fair given the inflation rate will favor me in future rounds. Let's end this now.""}
