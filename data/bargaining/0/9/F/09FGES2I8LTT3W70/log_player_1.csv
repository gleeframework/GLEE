I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure it's a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation and Bob's rejection of my previous offer. Accepting this ensures I get something, and avoids the risk of getting nothing in the end."
