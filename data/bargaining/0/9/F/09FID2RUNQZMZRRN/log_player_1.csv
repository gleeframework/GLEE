"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm losing money to inflation each round.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, Alice. I'm feeling more generous now, but let's not drag this out. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Bob, my offer is still the same.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable and end this.""} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm raising my offer again, but this is as high as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to pressure me into accepting a suboptimal deal. While the time pressure is on, accepting now would mean settling for significantly less than my initial offer. I need to remain firm and hope Bob understands the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm compromising. This is lower than my previous offers, but I want to reach an agreement. Time is running out for both of us.""} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  We're both losing money with every passing round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. The inflation is eating into my potential gains with each passing round, and holding out for a slightly better deal is too risky now. A 50/50 split ensures we both get something and avoid walking away with nothing."
