Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 70:30 is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{
