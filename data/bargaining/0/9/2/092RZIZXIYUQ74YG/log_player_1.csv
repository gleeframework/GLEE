"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take 9000$ and give 1000$ to Bob.  I think this is a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to secure half now than risk getting less in the next round."
