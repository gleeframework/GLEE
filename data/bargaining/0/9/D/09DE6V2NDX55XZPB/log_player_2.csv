Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are slowly getting more reasonable.  While this offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  We need to push our advantage as time runs out and her potential gains decrease further."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - the deal gets worse every round for both of us, especially you, Alice.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  Alice's offers are steadily decreasing, showing she's feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, her potential gains decrease, making my offers relatively more attractive. 
* **Ultimatum:**  By framing this as my ""final offer"", I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept a deal that's more beneficial to me. 
* **Slight Concession:** Offering $4900 is a slight concession on my part, which might make Alice more likely to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal in later rounds."
