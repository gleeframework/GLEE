"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the relative values. However, since the money I gain is now worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 400,000 for me and 600,000 for him, and considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to increase my share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, taking into account the inflation effect. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to push his advantage!

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is now worth less than it was in the first round, but still more than my share. However, since my share is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the relative values.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 450,000 for me and 550,000 for him, and considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to increase my share again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a higher share, taking into account the inflation effect and trying to reverse the trend. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
