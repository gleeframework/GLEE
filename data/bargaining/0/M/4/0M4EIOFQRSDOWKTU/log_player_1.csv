"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, the 50 dollars I would gain is actually equivalent to 54 dollars in the first round.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a decent one, and I'm willing to accept it. So, my answer is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
