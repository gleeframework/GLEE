"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

This offer gives Bob the majority of the money, hoping to create a sense of fairness and make it more likely that he'll accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too generous to Bob. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it gives him a significantly larger share of the money, and I'm hoping that he'll come back with a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split. Will you accept this compromise?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to a 50/50 split, while still giving me a slightly larger share."
