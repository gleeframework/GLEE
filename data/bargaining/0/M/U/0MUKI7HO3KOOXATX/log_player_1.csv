"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I take $55 and Bob takes $45. Given the inflation impact, where the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, I believe this division is relatively fair. It slightly favors me to compensate for the lesser impact of inflation on my share, but still offers Bob a significant portion to incentivize acceptance and avoid further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation disparity, but I believe my contribution warrants a slightly larger share this round. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob in this round compared to the first, I believe Bob's offer doesn't adequately reflect the impact of inflation on our respective shares. Accepting $45 now, which is worth less than it was in the first round, doesn't seem favorable considering the accelerating devaluation of the money, especially for Bob. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a more balanced division considering the inflationary pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, let's find a middle ground to secure our shares.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm adjusting my initial proposal to $52 for myself and $48 for Bob. Given that we're now in the third round and the money continues to devalue, I'm attempting to find a compromise that acknowledges the urgency of reaching an agreement. By slightly reducing my share from the initial offer, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept this division, recognizing that further rounds will only diminish the value of our potential gains."
