"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very unequal offer, knowing that the money will depreciate. I want to see if Bob will be greedy and take the small offer now, or if he'll risk it and try to get more later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 510000, ""bob_gain"": 490000}
```

I'm going to make a more balanced offer this time, recognizing that Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this offer will be appealing enough to avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation."
