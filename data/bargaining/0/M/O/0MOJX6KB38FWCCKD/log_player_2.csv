"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have nothing to lose by waiting. Meanwhile, Alice has an incentive to offer me more in the next rounds because the money loses value for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, but still relatively fair, considering the value of money remains the same for me but decreases for Alice.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering your loss, I'll take a bit more.""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer reflects the fact that Alice loses value over time, so she might be inclined to accept a slightly less favorable offer now rather than risk losing more value in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 40. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I can still potentially get a better deal in the next rounds. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, there's no pressure to accept this offer, and Alice's incentive to offer me more increases as the rounds progress due to the devaluation of the money for her.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current situation, I'm in a stronger negotiating position because I don't suffer from the inflation penalty. I'll wait for Alice to make an even more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the current situation, I'll make an offer that is slightly more favorable to me than the last one, considering Alice's increasing incentive to settle due to the devaluation of her potential gain.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""The longer we wait, the less you'll get. I'm willing to settle for a bit more than before.""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer takes into account the pressure on Alice due to the inflation penalty, aiming to find a balance where she might accept the offer rather than risk losing even more value in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I can't accept getting less than 40. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer because Alice is still offering me less than I previously offered her, and given the increasing pressure on her due to inflation, I believe I can get an even better deal in the next rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince I don't lose any value over time and Alice does, it makes sense for me to hold out for a deal that is at least as good as the one I previously proposed, if not better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that is slightly more favorable to me than the last one, considering Alice's increasing desperation due to the significant devaluation of her potential gain.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""You're losing a lot of value over time. This might be your best chance to walk away with something.""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer takes into account the substantial pressure on Alice due to the inflation penalty, aiming to present an option where she might accept the offer rather than risk losing even more value in subsequent rounds, potentially ending up with very little or nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a small loss, but I need to get at least 35. We're running out of time. 
# Bob gain: 65 
# Alice gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer because, despite Alice's growing desperation, she's still offering me less than I previously proposed. Given the immense pressure on her due to the significant devaluation of her potential gain and the limited number of rounds left, I believe I can push for an even better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince I don't suffer from the inflation penalty and Alice is under considerable pressure, it seems logical to hold out for a deal that is at least as favorable as my last proposal, if not more so. The risk of not reaching an agreement and both of us getting nothing is a risk I'm willing to take given the current dynamics."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make an offer that is even more favorable to me, considering Alice's dire situation due to the extreme devaluation of her potential gain and the limited time left.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Time's running out, and you're losing a lot of value. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer reflects the significant leverage I have due to the inflation penalty affecting only Alice. With the rounds ticking away, the pressure on her to accept a less favorable deal increases, making it more likely she might agree to this proposal rather than risk ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm losing value rapidly. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer because, despite having held out for a better deal, Alice's desperation and the significant devaluation of her potential gain suggest that she is unlikely to accept a worse offer than this in the remaining rounds. Given the risk of not reaching an agreement and both of us getting nothing, it seems prudent to accept this offer, which is still quite favorable to me.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the extreme pressure on Alice and the limited time left, this offer is likely the best compromise I can achieve without risking the entire amount. It's a strategic decision to secure a favorable outcome rather than gamble on the chance of an even better deal in the next rounds."
