Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000

This is a tough one! Bob is playing hardball. However, accepting this offer gives you $490,000. If you reject and Bob continues to whittle down your share, you risk getting a much worse deal or even nothing as inflation eats into your potential gains.  It's better to secure a decent amount now than gamble on a slightly better outcome later."
