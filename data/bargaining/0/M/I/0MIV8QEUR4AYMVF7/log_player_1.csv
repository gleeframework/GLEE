Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Let's divide the money in a 3:1 ratio. This way, we share fairly while considering the decreasing value of money in future rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the decreasing value of money for you in future rounds.  Let's make a deal and avoid further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
