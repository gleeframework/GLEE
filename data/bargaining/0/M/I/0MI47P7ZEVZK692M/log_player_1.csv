"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both get a decent amount.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain would be 95% of $60, which is $57.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I'd like to get a better deal. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
