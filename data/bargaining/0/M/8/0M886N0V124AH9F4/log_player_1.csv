"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{

  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $10,000."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, my gain of 4500 is now worth 4050 in the original terms, and Bob's gain of 5500 is worth 4400.

I'll accept this offer.
