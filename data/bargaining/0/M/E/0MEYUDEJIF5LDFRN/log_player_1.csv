"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I believe I deserve a larger share. Let's try a 60/40 split, and we can both be happy. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob's proposal is actually the same as my original offer, just with the labels swapped. I'm not interested in accepting the same offer I already rejected.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000."
