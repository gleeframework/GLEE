"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair proposal, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can give me 60, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my gain of 40 is actually worth $36.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since it's a relatively small difference from the previous round, I'll decide to reject it and try to get a better deal.

```
