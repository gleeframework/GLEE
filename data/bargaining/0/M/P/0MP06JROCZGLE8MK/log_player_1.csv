Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your higher inflation rate, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, given that we are both facing inflation.  Let's settle this in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
