Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing rapidly and Bob being very aggressive, I'll make a desperate attempt to get a better deal. I'll offer a very small amount to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 99,
  ""message"": ""Take the crumbs, Bob!""

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 8.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I guess I'll take the ""crumbs"" I offered him earlier, and Bob will take the rest. It's not a great outcome, but I'm not sure I had much leverage left."
