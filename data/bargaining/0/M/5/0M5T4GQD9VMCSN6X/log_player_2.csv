"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can find something more equitable. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want something more equitable, so I'm willing to take the same split you offered, but in my favor. It's only fair. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, accepting a 45/55 split in round 3 is better than risking a worse offer in round 4 where the money will be worth even less."
