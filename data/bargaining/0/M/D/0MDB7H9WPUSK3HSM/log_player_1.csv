"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm taking a bit more this time, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. This round, I'll take the slightly larger share.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I need to get closer to my desired share. This is my final offer before I go for the majority. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is playing a tough game, but his offer is still worse than my initial offer, even with inflation. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  He's threatened to push for a majority, but that will hurt him too as the total value decreases."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Bob. Accept this offer and we both get something reasonable. Otherwise, we both lose out as the pot gets smaller.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out. I'm taking a bigger share this time, but it's your call. We both know the stakes are getting higher. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is getting dangerous, but Bob is getting way too greedy.  He's taking advantage of the fact that my position worsens each round, but he doesn't seem to realize that holding out to the end will leave us both with nothing. I need to show him I'm serious, but I also need to signal I'm willing to compromise *somewhat* to avoid a total loss."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, you've made your point. Let's settle this before it's too late. I'm willing to accept a smaller share than I'd like, but this is as low as I'm going.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to get real.  Bob is clearly willing to play hardball, and the shrinking pot is hurting me more than him.  I'm offering him the deal he wanted back in Round 2. It means accepting a loss compared to my initial offer, but it's far better than walking away with nothing if this continues to drag on. This offer conveys both a willingness to compromise and a firm limit on how much I'll concede."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my last offer. I'm taking the majority, but at least we'll both get something. If you reject, we both lose everything. It's your choice. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a terrible offer, but Bob is playing chicken with the entire pot.  He's betting that I won't risk losing everything, and he's probably right. While getting only $2,000 after starting at a potential $6,000 feels awful, it's still better than getting nothing after 12 rounds. Bob has exploited my weakness to inflation masterfully, but at least I'm walking away with something."
