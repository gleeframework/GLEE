"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice compared to the original 1,000,000$, the current value is:

My gain: 0.8 * 0.95 * 1,000,000 = 760,000
Alice's gain: 0.2 * 0.95 * 1,000,000 = 190,000

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
