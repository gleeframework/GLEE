"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time to avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less in the second round, accepting the even split now will result in a higher real value than potentially getting a slightly higher nominal amount in a future round but with further devaluation due to inflation. It's wise to secure the offer now to avoid further losses."
