Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I think this split is more reflective of the decreasing value over time. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
