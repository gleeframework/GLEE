"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering a division where I get $55 and Bob gets $45. I've attached a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair division, with me taking a slightly larger share. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this proposal or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Fairness is important! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer to split the money evenly. While Bob's message emphasizes the importance of fairness, I'm aware that the value of the money for Bob decreases by 10% with each round due to inflation, whereas for me, the value remains constant. This dynamic gives me an advantage in negotiations as we progress through the rounds. By rejecting this offer, I aim to capitalize on this advantage and potentially secure a more favorable division in subsequent rounds."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more this time""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making an offer where I get $58 and Bob gets $42. My message acknowledges the impact of inflation on Bob's share, implying that because the value of the money decreases for him but not for me, I should take a slightly larger portion. This approach aims to pressure Bob into accepting a less favorable division due to the looming threat of further devaluation in subsequent rounds."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is a factor, but I'm willing to give you a bit more this time to hopefully come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I've decided to reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's willingness to give me a bit more in an attempt to reach an agreement, the offer still doesn't favor me as much as I believe it should, given the impact of inflation on Bob's share. With the value of Bob's potential gain decreasing by 27.1% since the first round and no devaluation on my end, I see an opportunity to negotiate for an even better outcome in the following rounds. By rejecting this offer, I aim to apply pressure on Bob, who should be increasingly motivated to settle as the value of his potential gain continues to decline.### {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm making an offer where I get $60 and Bob gets $40. My message explicitly points out that time is not on Bob's side due to inflation, implying that the longer we negotiate, the less valuable his share becomes. This is an attempt to persuade Bob that accepting this offer now would be in his best interest, as further delays will only result in a less favorable outcome for him.### {""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Time isn't on your side, Bob.

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I've decided to reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's willingness to concede a bit more and his emphasis on the need to reach a deal soon, the offer still doesn't favor me as much as I believe it should, given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share. With the value of Bob's potential gain decreasing by 40.95% since the first round and no devaluation on my end, I remain confident that I can negotiate for an even better outcome in the following rounds. By rejecting this offer, I continue to apply pressure on Bob, who should be increasingly motivated to settle as the value of his potential gain continues to decline.### {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm making an offer where I get $62 and Bob gets $38. My message reiterates the impact of inflation on Bob's share, emphasizing that with each passing round, the value of his potential gain decreases substantially. This is an attempt to persuade Bob that accepting this offer now would be in his best interest, as further delays will only exacerbate his losses. By offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, I'm testing his willingness to compromise and assessing his level of desperation in the face of mounting inflationary pressure.### {""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Inflation's grip is tightening, Bob.

# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I've decided to reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's assertion that inflation is hurting us both, the reality is that only his share is being devalued, while mine remains unaffected. With the value of Bob's potential gain decreasing by 52.17% since the first round, I see no reason to accept an offer that doesn't reflect this substantial disparity. By rejecting this offer, I continue to apply pressure on Bob, who should be increasingly desperate to settle as the value of his potential gain continues to decline precipitously.### {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm making an offer where I get $65 and Bob gets $35. My message explicitly highlights the severe impact of inflation on Bob's share, emphasizing that he has already lost over half of the value of his potential gain since the first round. I'm attempting to persuade Bob that he is in a dire situation and that accepting this offer now would be the best way to salvage what remains of his share. By offering Bob a smaller share than before, I'm pushing him to make a decision, hoping that the pressure of mounting losses will force him to accept my proposal.### {""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""You've already lost over half, Bob.

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I've decided to reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's claim that this is his final offer and his emphasis on the need to settle before we both lose more to inflation, the reality remains that only his share is being devalued, while mine remains unaffected. With the value of Bob's potential gain decreasing by 61.26% since the first round, I believe he is in a much weaker negotiating position than I am. Furthermore, Bob's offer of a 30-70 split in his favor is unrealistic given the current state of negotiations and the impact of inflation on his share. By rejecting this offer, I am calling Bob's bluff on his claim that this is his final offer, and I expect him to return with a more reasonable proposal in the next round.### {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm making an offer where I get $70 and Bob gets $30. My message reiterates that Bob's share has lost significant value due to inflation and emphasizes that I am now in a position to dictate the terms of the agreement. I'm attempting to persuade Bob that he has no choice but to accept this offer, as further resistance would only lead to him losing even more. By offering Bob a smaller share than before, I'm applying maximum pressure, hoping to force him into accepting my proposal.### {""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""You're running out of options, Bob.

# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","I've decided to reject Bob's offer.

With the value of Bob's potential gain decreasing by 68.62% since the first round, I believe he is desperate to salvage what remains of his share. However, his offer of a 25-75 split in his favor is unrealistic given the current state of negotiations and the impact of inflation on his share. By rejecting this offer, I am willing to walk away from the negotiation and forgo any potential gain, knowing that Bob will be left with nothing.### {""decision"": ""reject""}"
