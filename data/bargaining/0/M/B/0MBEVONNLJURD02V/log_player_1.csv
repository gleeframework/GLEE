Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor. While it's a significant advantage, I believe it's a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's clear that Bob is playing a hard game.  Inflation is impacting us both, and accepting his offer is the best way to secure at least some money.  I'm sure we'll both regret this in the future, but it's the smartest move right now."
