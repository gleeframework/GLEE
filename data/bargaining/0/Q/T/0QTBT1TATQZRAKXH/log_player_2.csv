"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money, Bob. This offer is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is not fair. I am willing to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's start with this and see if we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation.  How about we meet in the middle? This offer gives us both a better deal than the last round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, I am willing to accept this offer. The inflation is becoming a concern, and it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
