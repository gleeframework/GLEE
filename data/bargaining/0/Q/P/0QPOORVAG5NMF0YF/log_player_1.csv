"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, but I'll give you a slightly better deal to get us closer to the end. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,750, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,500.

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split, but I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
