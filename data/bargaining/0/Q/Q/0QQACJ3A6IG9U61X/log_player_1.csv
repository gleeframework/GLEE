"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll evaluate the offer.

In Round 2, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 1, so the actual values are:

* Alice gain: 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000
* Bob gain: 700,000 * 0.95 = 665,000

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather negotiate further.

Round 3
