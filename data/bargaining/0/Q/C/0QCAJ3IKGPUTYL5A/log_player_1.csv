"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm taking a slight advantage this round, but I think it's a better deal for both of us than yours. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving him a larger share, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm thinking about the value in terms of the original $10,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle. Let's split it evenly this round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,000 and keeping $5,000 for myself. This way, we can split the remaining money relatively evenly."
