"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair for both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Alice accepts this offer. Remember, the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, so I'm trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. The inflation is only getting worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I think this is the best offer I'll get. If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round, so I'll accept this offer."
