I'm going to try to get a better deal this time, even though the money is worth less. I think Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair share."

I'm not going to push my luck any further. The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I'm sure I won't get a better offer next round. I'll take what I can get."
