"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting $5000, but Bob is getting $6000, which is 20% more than his initial offer. That's a pretty generous offer from Bob.

I'll accept this offer.
