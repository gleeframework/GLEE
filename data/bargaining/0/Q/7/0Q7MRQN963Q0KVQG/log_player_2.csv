Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, your offer didn't reflect the fairness of the initial split. This offer is closer to what I initially proposed, adjusted for inflation. Let's settle this before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600
