"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but don't expect it to last! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting $4000, which is worth 90% of $4500, and I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, it's now worth 90% of the original amount.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but don't expect me to be generous forever!""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still keeping some room for negotiation."
