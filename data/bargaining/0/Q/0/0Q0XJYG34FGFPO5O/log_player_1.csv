"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 99.999% of the money, you get $1. It's a small price to pay for the thrill of the game!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and reasonable proposal 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give up my chance to negotiate further. Let's see what I can get in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less for Bob now (20% less than the previous round), I'll try to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money for Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999.99,
  ""bob_gain"": 0.01,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time and money, Bob! I'll give you a tiny bit, but I'm taking the lion's share!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to go down without a fight! 
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself. With the money being worth 48.8% less for Bob, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

However, I'm still trying to maximize my gain. Since I get 750,000, which is 75% of the original amount, I'll think it's a good deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you've made a decent offer. I'll take 75% of the original amount and call it a day.""
}
```"
