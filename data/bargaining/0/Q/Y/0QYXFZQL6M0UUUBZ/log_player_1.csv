"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away too much!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk, but I think I deserve more. This is my counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. Bob is proposing a 30-70 split, which is quite skewed in his favor. I'd rather not give up 70% of the remaining money. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that I'm now worth 20% less than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give away too much more. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. The 40-60 split is still a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'd rather not give up more than 40% of the remaining money. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the further inflation and the fact that I'm now worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 2800,
  ""bob_gain"": 7200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Take it or leave it!""
}
