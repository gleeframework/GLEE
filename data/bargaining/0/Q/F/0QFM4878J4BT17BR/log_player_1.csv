"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the money now, or I'll make a new offer next round.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%. The message tries to entice Bob to accept the offer by suggesting that if he doesn't, I'll make an even more advantageous offer next round."
