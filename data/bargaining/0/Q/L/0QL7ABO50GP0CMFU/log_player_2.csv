Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be greedy, split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage.  While the offer might seem ""fair"" on the surface, it's important to remember that her share is worth significantly less due to the rapid devaluation. We need to push for a more advantageous split before inflation eats away at the value of our potential winnings."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option. Take it before we both lose out!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I want a larger share, it's clear Alice won't budge much from her previous offers.  A 50/50 split, even with inflation considered, is better than risking a total loss if we run out of rounds."
