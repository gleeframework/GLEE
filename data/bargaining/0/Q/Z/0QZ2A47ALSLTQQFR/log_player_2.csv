"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since I rejected her 50-50 offer, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I should aim to get a higher percentage of the remaining amount to compensate. However, I don't know how Alice's offer is affected by inflation, so I'll have to make a decision based on my own perspective.

In this round, my gain of 55 is worth 9.75% less than my gain in the first round, which was 50. So, my gain of 55 is equivalent to 50 / (1 - 0.0975) = 54.55 in the first round. This is a good offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject the offer for now and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal for myself. Since my gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 58 
# Alice gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! My gain of 58 is worth 18.55% less than my gain in the first round, which was 50. So, my gain of 58 is equivalent to 50 / (1 - 0.1855) = 62.38 in the first round. This is a good offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll think about it for a moment... Ah, I'll accept the offer.
