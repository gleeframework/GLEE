My message to Bob is ""Let's divide fairly"". I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, ending the game quickly and minimizing the impact of inflation."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's not waste any more time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less in this round, Bob's offer of $450,000 is actually equivalent to $360,000 in the first round. Considering I initially offered Bob $400,000, I think I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again to make a proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll try to find a middle ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, Bob's offer of $480,000 is actually equivalent to approximately $246,400 in the first round. Considering the significant decrease in value, I think I can still try to negotiate for a better deal. However, Bob claims this is his final offer, so I need to weigh the risks of rejecting it.\n\nSince we still have 8 rounds left, I'll take a chance and reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal or make a more favorable proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
