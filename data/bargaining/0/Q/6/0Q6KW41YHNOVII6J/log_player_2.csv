Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds go on and the value for her decreases. While her offer might seem ""fair"" on the surface, it still heavily favors her if we consider the inflation impact.  I'm betting she'll become more willing to accept a deal favoring me as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  It's the most rational choice given the dwindling value."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my guns with a seemingly ""fair"" 50/50 split. While I could push for more, there's a risk Alice might accept a less favorable deal out of desperation in the later rounds. This way, I secure a guaranteed win without risking it all for a slightly larger gain."
