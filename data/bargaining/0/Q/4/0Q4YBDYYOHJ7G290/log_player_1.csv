"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the 10% and let's play on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original $1,000,000. I'll take the remaining $900,000. My message to Bob is to get the game started and take the smaller share, and then we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's play fair! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the effective amount I would gain in this round is $720,000 (900,000 x 0.8).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll take the middle ground and accept his proposal. I'll gain $500,000, and Bob will gain $500,000.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
