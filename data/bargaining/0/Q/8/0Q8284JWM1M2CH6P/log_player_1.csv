"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 50/50!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll take $500,000 and Bob will take $500,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% and take the rest, it's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about it.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate or make a better proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time, but I think it's a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, where I'll take $300,000 and Bob will take $700,000. I'm trying to be more flexible and make a more reasonable offer to try to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny piece of the pie, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting stingier and stingier!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob might not be willing to budge further.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
