Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a 65/35 split is more reflective of the situation.  The value decreases faster for you, so let's make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
