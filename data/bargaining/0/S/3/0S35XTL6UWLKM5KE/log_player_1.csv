"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a split that's more beneficial for both of us.  Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less, so the effective value of the $45 I would get is actually $42.75.

I'll have to think carefully about Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the effective value of the money is decreasing. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""You can't outbid me, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go higher than before.  Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is losing value rapidly. I need to think carefully about Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the effective value of the $40 I would get is actually $34.47.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll have to think about it...
