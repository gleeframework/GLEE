Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money! Let's settle this now. This offer still gives you a considerable amount.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's greed:** Bob's offer in Round 2 shows he's aiming for a larger share, using inflation as a negotiation tactic. 
* **Time pressure:**  While the money devalues for both of us, Alice is affected more severely. A faster resolution is in her best interest.
* **Strong position:** Alice started with a strong offer and is gradually reducing it. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a favorable outcome. 

By offering slightly more than Bob's last offer, Alice attempts to make a deal attractive enough to accept while maximizing her potential gain."
