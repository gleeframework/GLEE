Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 420000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is Bob's best option at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for Bob with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice's message implies she is becoming less willing to negotiate. This suggests her offers are unlikely to improve from Bob's perspective.

Accepting the current offer secures Bob a reasonable amount, even if reduced by inflation, and avoids the risk of getting an even lower offer in a future round."
