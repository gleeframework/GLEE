I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, keeping the majority for myself.  It's a pretty aggressive opening move, but I want to see how Bob responds.  He might think it's unfair, but with the inflation factor, he knows the money will be worth less if we go further. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob has turned the tables on me! I'm not going to accept that deal. It's true that the money is worth less with each round, but I'm not going to let him take 90% of the pie just because it's his turn. We're still early in the game, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  Let's see what I can offer in the next round."

Round 3

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time.  Bob clearly wants a big chunk of the money, but I'm not going to let him have everything.  This 55/45 split is a compromise, but it still gives me a decent share.  I hope he sees it as a good deal, considering the inflation that's happening with each round.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer.  He's pushing for a 60/40 split, and while the inflation is getting more severe, I believe I can get a better deal.  He's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less with each passing round, but I won't give in so easily.  I'll make another offer in the next round, hopefully something more fair."

Round 5

I'm going to try to flip the script this time. Bob's been pushing for a larger share, but with the inflation continuing, I think he'll be more willing to consider a 60/40 split in my favor. This offer is a bit more aggressive than my previous one, but I'm feeling confident that I can secure a deal that's more beneficial for me this time around."
