"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but not too generous, offer. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's better to see if Alice is willing to be more generous.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to control the next proposal and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This is a fair starting point, and we can avoid the risk of losing money in future rounds.""}
