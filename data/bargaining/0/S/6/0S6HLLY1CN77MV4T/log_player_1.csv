"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000, and I'll take $6000. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking.

For this round, the total amount is still $10,000, but it's worth less due to inflation. My gain of $5000 is worth 10% less than the original $6000 I proposed, which is $5400 in value. Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 5% less than the original $4000 he would have gotten, which is $3800 in value.

Considering this, I think the 50/50 split is actually a good deal for me, since I'm getting more value than I would have in the original proposal.
