This is a tough decision, but time pressure is mounting. Here's why I choose to accept:

* **Inflation:**  The value of my potential gains is decreasing rapidly.  Waiting longer means a significantly smaller reward, even if I get a slightly better split.
* **Alice's Offer:** 70/30 is not ideal, but it's better than what she offered previously. It also seems like her ""final offer.""
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a 60/40 split (or better) is incredibly risky at this point. If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. 

While not ideal, accepting 300,000 (after inflation) is better than the risk of getting zero.
