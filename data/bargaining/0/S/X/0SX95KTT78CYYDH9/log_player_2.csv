"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more in my favor, considering the inflation risk I'm taking.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. This is my counteroffer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases rapidly for you. Take this deal while it's still decent. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Given the inflation, I think this is a reasonable deal, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIt seems like the game is over, and I've accepted Alice's offer. I'll take the $48, considering the decreased value due to inflation."
