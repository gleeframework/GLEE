"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the new total is $950,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Splitting it evenly seems fair, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
