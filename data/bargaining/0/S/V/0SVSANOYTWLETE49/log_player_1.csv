"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%. This is a relatively fair starting offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this case, I'm looking at a 50% gain, which is equivalent to a 62.5% gain in the first round.

I think Bob's offer is a good one, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
