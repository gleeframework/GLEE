"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  It's risky to wait longer since the money will be worth less for me in each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less for me now, I'm better off taking this offer than risking another round and getting a worse deal."
