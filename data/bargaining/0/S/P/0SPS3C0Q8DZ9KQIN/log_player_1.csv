"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal this time, let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too even, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can finalize the split at $5000 for me and $5000 for Bob."
