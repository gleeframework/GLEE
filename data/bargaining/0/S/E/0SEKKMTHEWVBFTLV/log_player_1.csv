I propose to take 900,000 and give Bob 100,000. This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. I hope he accepts this fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm offering 810,000 for myself and 190,000 for Bob. This is still a significant portion for Bob, considering the inflation we're facing. I hope he'll realize it's better to take this deal than risk losing even more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is far less than what I initially wanted, the inflation is hitting me hard. It's better to take this 400,000 than risk getting even less in the next round."
