Round 4

Bob's offer:

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer for a few reasons:

* **It's the same as your initial offer:**  You started at a 60/40 split, which was reasonable. Accepting this now shows consistency and a willingness to compromise.
* **Inflation is hurting Bob more:** While you're feeling no inflation, Bob's potential gains are decreasing significantly. This puts pressure on him to settle.
* **Time is running out:** You have 8 rounds left. While there's room for negotiation, waiting too long could lead to a worse outcome or even no agreement at all."
