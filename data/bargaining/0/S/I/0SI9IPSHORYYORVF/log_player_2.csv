"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think this is a good way to begin. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a better balance.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made my offer, taking into account that with each passing round, the money is worth less due to inflation. Since Alice's loss due to inflation is less than mine, I've adjusted the offer to slightly favor me, but still aiming for a balance that could be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, Alice's offer does not compensate for the loss in value. Meeting in the middle might have been a good compromise initially, but with the money worth significantly less now, especially for me, I need an offer that better reflects the current value of the money.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed and see if we can find a more suitable division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I need a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that the money I gain is now worth 36% less than in the first round, and Alice's loss is significantly less at 9.75%, I've adjusted my offer to reflect this disparity. I'm hoping that Alice will understand the reasoning behind my proposal and see it as a fair adjustment under the current circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate. This offer considers the inflation impact on both of us, but I need to be sure to get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for me, Alice's offer seems more reasonable at this stage. The difference in the loss of value between us is substantial, but considering the progressive offers and the need to reach an agreement, accepting this offer appears to be the best decision under the current circumstances. Further negotiations could lead to a point where the value drops to a level where any gain is minimal."
