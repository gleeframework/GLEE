"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not sure about a 50/50 split, considering the initial amount is $10,000. I'd like to propose a slightly more skewed split in my favor. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about a 50/50 split, I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}"
