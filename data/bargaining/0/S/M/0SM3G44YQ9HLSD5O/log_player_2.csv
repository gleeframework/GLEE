"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this scenario, accepting the first offer might seem tempting due to the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. However, considering the substantial difference in the proposed division (350,000 for Bob vs. 650,000 for Alice), and given that the decrease in value affects Alice more significantly (10% vs. 5%), it might be strategic to reject the offer and propose a more favorable division in the next round, hoping to capitalize on the pressure the decreasing value puts on Alice. This strategic approach aims to potentially secure a better deal for Bob, despite the risk of further devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground considering the devaluation.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, considering the devaluation impact, proposing a division that slightly favors Alice but is closer to an equal split than the initial offer seems reasonable. The message aims to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and the mutual awareness of the decreasing value of money, encouraging a quicker resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money, Bob! Let's settle this before inflation eats away our gains. This offer is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the impact of inflation and the decreasing value of money for both parties, Alice's offer in round 3 presents a more balanced compromise compared to the initial proposal. Considering that further rounds would only decrease the value of potential gains, and recognizing that Alice's offer now is closer to a fair division, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable decision to secure a substantial amount before the value drops further."
