"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can split the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, his offer seems more attractive to me now. I'll accept his offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
