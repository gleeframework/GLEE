"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll evaluate the offer accordingly.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather have a slightly larger share, considering the value of the money hasn't decreased for me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $500 from the initial offer, while keeping the total sum at $10,000."
