"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a fair and simple offer, but I'm sure Bob might try to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can have 60, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I think I can do better!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're giving me 60 in the last offer, I'll settle for 55""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept a slightly smaller share."
