"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see what Bob will propose in response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the smaller share, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bigger share this time, but I'm still not giving away too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see what Bob will propose next!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving away too much either! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have hoped for, but it's better than rejecting and risking getting an even worse deal in the next round."
