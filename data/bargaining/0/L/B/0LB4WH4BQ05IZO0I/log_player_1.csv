"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob. This is a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, Alice. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,200 (80% of $4,000).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's a more even split than my initial offer, so I'll consider it. However, I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, or $8,000. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. But I think I deserve a bit more for taking on the risk of negotiation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a compromise."
