"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is not as generous as mine was, I'll have to consider whether it's worth accepting.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was not as good as mine in round 1, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer in round 3. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns. Given that his offer is slightly more generous than my offer in round 3, and considering the effects of inflation, I'll accept his offer this time.
