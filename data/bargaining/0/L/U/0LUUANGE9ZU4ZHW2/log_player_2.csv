Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I also need a fair share. Let's compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}
I still think I can get a better deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try and get more. Alice's offer is better than the first one, but I believe I can push for an even more favorable split. Bring on the next round!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. We need to reach an agreement before the inflation takes even more of our money! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}
I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. With inflation taking a bigger bite out of my share with each passing round, I risk losing even more value if I continue to hold out. Alice's offer of 48 is slightly better than her previous one, and considering the accelerating inflation, I believe it's the best deal I'm likely to get. Time to settle and take what I can get!"
