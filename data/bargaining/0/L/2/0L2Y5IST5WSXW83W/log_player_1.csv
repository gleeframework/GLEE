"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we have 12 rounds to go and the value of the money is decreasing for me each round. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is thinking ahead to the decreasing value of the money.

I'll have to think about this for a moment... 

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 40% share just yet. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60/40 split, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split, which is closer to my desired share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on a 55/45 split. Will you accept?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution considering the time remaining and the decreasing value of the money for me. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, and considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob, I think it's a good opportunity to accept.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can end the game here!"
