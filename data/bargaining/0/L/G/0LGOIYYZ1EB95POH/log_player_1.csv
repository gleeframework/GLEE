Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n### Considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, accepting Bob's offer at this stage seems like the best course of action. The difference in our gains is substantial, but further rounds would only decrease the value of the money for both of us, with my potential gains devaluing more significantly. It's time to accept and walk away with what's left."
