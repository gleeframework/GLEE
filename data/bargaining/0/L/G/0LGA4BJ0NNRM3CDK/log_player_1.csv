"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount. Given that the money loses value for him with each passing round, I believe this is a reasonable and fair offer for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money loses value for Bob with each passing round, he will be more motivated to make a better offer as the game progresses. Additionally, his current offer gives him more than half of the total amount, which I don't think is fair. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""You're running out of time, let's settle""}\n\nGiven that the money is losing value for Bob with each passing round, I'm making an offer that is slightly more favorable to me than my initial offer. I'm still leaving a significant amount for Bob, but I'm hoping that the pressure of the decreasing value will encourage him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering that Bob's offer has improved significantly from the previous rounds, and he's emphasized that this is his final offer, I'm inclined to accept it. The amount I'll receive, $520,000, is still a substantial portion of the total, and I don't want to risk Bob becoming more stubborn and the game dragging on indefinitely. Additionally, since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can walk away with a decent amount. I'll take the offer and end the game."
