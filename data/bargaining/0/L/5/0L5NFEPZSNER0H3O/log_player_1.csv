"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 into $7,500 for me and $2,500 for you. This offers a fair split considering the diminishing value of money with each round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a slightly more generous split, but still taking into account the inflation factor. This way, we can end the game sooner. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
