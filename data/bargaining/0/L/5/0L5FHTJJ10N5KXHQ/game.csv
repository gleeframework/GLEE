900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair but generous split. I'm sure we can work out something better in the future.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
100000.0,900000.0,I think we can do better than that. Let's start with a more equal split.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Let's try to be reasonable here. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need to make sure I get a fair return as well.  We're both losing money with every round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
200000.0,800000.0,We're both losing value with each round. Let's be pragmatic and split it 80/20 this time. I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd prefer a different arrangement.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you a good chunk of the money, but I need to secure a larger share to offset the increasing inflation. If we can't reach an agreement, we both risk losing even more.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
300000.0,700000.0,I'm willing to meet you halfway this time.  We're both losing out significantly.  Let's reach a compromise before we both lose everything.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
600000.0,400000.0,We're both losing too much at this rate. Let's end this now with a 60/40 split.  It's the best we can do given the circumstances.,Alice,7,
