"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. 60-40 seems reasonable.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob will get 40% or $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $30 is actually worth 80% of $60, which is $48.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is willing to compromise, I'll decide to accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
