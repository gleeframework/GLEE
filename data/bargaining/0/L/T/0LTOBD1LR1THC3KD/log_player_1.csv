I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'll take my chances and counter in the next round.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a more even split this time. Bob rejected my offer last round, but hopefully this will be more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob seems to be playing a game of chicken. I'm still not convinced he's going to get a better deal, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low share. I'll counter with my own offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a more generous offer again. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to settle before the inflation hurts us both too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm losing money due to inflation. But I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe we can still find a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

This time, I'm offering a split closer to Bob's last offer, but still giving myself a slightly larger share.  I'm hoping this will entice him to agree before the inflation eats away too much more of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being increasingly stubborn, and the inflation is really starting to bite. But I'm not ready to give in just yet. I believe I can still get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

It's time to play it safe. I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  With the inflation, we're both losing a lot of money.  Hopefully, Bob realizes that we're both better off with a more equal share than continuing this game."
