"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 990,000$ for me and 10,000$ for Bob.  This is a very favorable split for me, but it gives Bob something to think about. It also leaves room for negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very bad deal for me. Even though Bob's offer is effectively the same as mine, I will reject it and hope to get a better deal later on.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try to be a little more reasonable this time. I'll offer Bob 100,000, which is a significant increase from his previous offer. This demonstrates good faith and leaves room for further negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very bad deal for me. While Bob's offer is more generous than his previous one, it's still incredibly unfavorable. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. There are still many rounds left, and I'm confident that I can secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try a higher offer for Bob this time. I hope that showing a willingness to compromise will make him more likely to accept in the next round."
