Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a significant amount before inflation hurts us further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
