"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice's gain: $570,000
Bob's gain: $1,050,000

I'll reject this offer. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is too skewed in his favor. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.

```

Alice's gain: $430,000
Bob's gain: $585,000
