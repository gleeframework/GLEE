{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be fair, I'm proposing a 60/40 split, but this time in my favor.  I'm sure you understand the time pressure we're both under with the inflation, so let's settle this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see your point about fairness. Let's try a 54/46 split in my favor. It's still a bit in my favor, but it reflects the inflation we're both facing. I hope this is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of this money is slipping away with each round. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the inflation disadvantage I'm facing while still offering you a substantial sum. Let's close this deal now.""}
