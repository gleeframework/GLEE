I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I think this is fair considering we have 12 rounds to divide the money."

{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

I'm offering a 8500/1500 split in my favor.  I'm willing to concede a little to avoid further inflation, but I still believe I should get the majority of the money."

I'm offering a 7500/2500 split in my favor.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I'm willing to come down further to avoid losing more.  This is a fair compromise considering the dwindling value of the money."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm offering a 6500/3500 split in my favor.  The inflation is really starting to bite now, and I'm willing to concede further to avoid losing more money. I think this offer is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is still a pretty bad deal for me, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get something better.  The inflation is getting worse, but I still think I can get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a 5500/4500 split in my favor.  This is my final offer - the inflation is killing me, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  I think this is a fair split considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not happy about only getting half, the inflation has reached a point where I'm risking getting nothing at all if I keep rejecting.  A 50/50 split is better than nothing."
