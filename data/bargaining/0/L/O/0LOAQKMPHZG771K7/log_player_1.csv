"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 4:1 is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. This is a generous starting offer, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no extreme splits 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise. Meeting in the middle is a fair approach, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
