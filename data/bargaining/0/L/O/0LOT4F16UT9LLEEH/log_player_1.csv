"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving it up to Bob to decide whether to accept or not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer because I think I can do better than a 40/60 split. The inflation is working against me, and I want to try to get a higher share of the money before it's too late!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a better deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not willing to go much further 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better. With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I want to aim for a higher share to compensate. 300,000 is not enough for me. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth significantly less now, so I'll aim for an even higher share to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 350000,
  ""bob_gain"": 650000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to make up for the lost value.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to go much further 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a big bite out of my potential earnings. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because the value of the money is dropping so rapidly. 250,000 is not enough for me, especially considering the inflation. I'll try to push for a higher share, but I'm getting desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth significantly less now, and I'm running out of time. I'll make a bold offer, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, I need a good deal or I'll be left with nothing.""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out as much as I can, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept this offer."
