"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nMy offer is 60% for me and 40% for Bob. I've included a message that says ""Let's be fair"" to convey that my proposal is reasonable and we should settle on this division to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share loses value quickly. Take this decent offer and we're done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer. Although the money's value is decreasing, accepting 45% of the already devalued amount seems unfair, especially considering the significant difference in how the inflation affects us. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a more balanced division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\nMy new offer gives me 58% and Bob 42%. Given the asymmetrical impact of inflation, I've adjusted my proposal to slightly favor myself while still aiming for a relatively fair division. The message ""Meet in the middle"" suggests finding a compromise, considering we both have to deal with the devaluation, albeit differently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the last round where my offer is above 50%. Take it or leave with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant decrease in value for my potential gain and the relatively minor decrease for Bob, accepting this offer seems the most reasonable choice. The difference in inflation impact heavily favors Bob in future rounds, and the risk of ending up with less or nothing is too high. Despite the slight imbalance in the division, accepting 49% of the now significantly devalued amount is preferable to risking further devaluation or ending up with nothing."
