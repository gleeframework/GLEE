Let's see what I can get!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

I'm going to offer Alice a slightly better deal than she gave me.  Let's see if she's willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, taking this offer is better than risking getting nothing in the next round. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and I don't want to risk a worse outcome."
