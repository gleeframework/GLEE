"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, but I'm trying to get a bit more for myself to start off strong. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is getting less valuable by the round. I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll aim for a more substantial gain this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this offer is acceptable, considering the decreasing value of money. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking even lower values in future rounds."
