"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now looking for a better deal. Bob's offer is 50% each, but considering the inflation, I'd be getting $4,500 (50% of $9,000) and Bob would be getting $4,500. This is a fair offer, so I'll accept it.
