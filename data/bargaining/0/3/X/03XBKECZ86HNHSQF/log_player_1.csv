"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can both do better. Let's be fair and split it evenly! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my offer from Round 1 would have been worth 90% of its original value, so the effective amounts would have been $540,000 for me and $360,000 for Bob.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll reject it since it's not as favorable to me as my original offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 90% of its original value after the first round and another 10% reduction due to inflation, the total effective value of the money is now 81% of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more after being rejected twice.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 54% of the effective $810,000, which is $437,400, and Bob gets 46%, which is $372,600."
