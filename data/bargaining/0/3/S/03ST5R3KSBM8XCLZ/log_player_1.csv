"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $45 and taking $55 for myself, considering that the value of money decreases by 10% for me and 5% for Bob in each round. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's better for Bob to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given that your money depreciates faster. Let's agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds. Accepting this offer would mean I'm giving up too much value, considering that Bob's money depreciates slower than mine. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the depreciation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nI've decreased my initial offer to $52 for myself and increased Bob's share to $48. Given the inflation, I believe this is a fair compromise, and Bob should consider accepting it to avoid further depreciation in the next rounds. Meeting in the middle shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
