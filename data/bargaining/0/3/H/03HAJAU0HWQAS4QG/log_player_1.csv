"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept and we can both get some money quickly.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and with the inflation, I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the future.  It's time to take what I can get!"
