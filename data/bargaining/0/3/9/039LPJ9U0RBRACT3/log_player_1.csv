"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take $999,999 for myself and leave $1 for Bob.  Since it's the first round and the inflation is still minimal, I want to maximize my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the inflation dynamics.  Accepting avoids the risk of further rounds where Bob might propose an even smaller share for me."
