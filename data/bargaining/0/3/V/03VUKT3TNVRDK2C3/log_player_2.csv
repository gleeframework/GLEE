"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but hopefully we can find a better deal for both of us in the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try and get a better deal.  While I'm happy to start fair, a 100k gain for me isn't much when there's 1 million on the table.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
