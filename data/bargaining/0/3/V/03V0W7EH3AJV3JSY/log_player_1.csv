"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $40 and kept $60 for myself, considering that the money is worth less with each passing round due to inflation. I included a message to justify my proposal and encourage Bob to accept it.\n\nYour turn! What's Bob's response?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something more realistic. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIn this round, Bob offered me $45, and he would keep $55. Considering the impact of inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less. I need to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus making a counteroffer in the next round.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer might seem more realistic, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, given the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's gains.\n\nMy response is:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see how the negotiations unfold!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a new offer to Bob. Considering the impact of inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less. I'll take this into account when making my proposal.\n\nMy offer is:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, considering the increasing inflation impact on your gains.""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $43 and keeping $57 for myself. I've included a message to justify my proposal and encourage Bob to accept it, highlighting the need to find a middle ground given the increasing impact of inflation on his gains.\n\nLet's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day before the inflation eats away at everything. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob offered to split the money evenly, with both of us getting $50. Considering the significant impact of inflation, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less. I need to carefully evaluate this offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.\n\nGiven the substantial decrease in value, especially for Bob's gains, I think accepting this offer would be the best decision. The alternative is to proceed to the next round, but the inflation would likely reduce the value even further, making it less desirable.\n\nMy response is:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIt's time to accept the offer and split the money evenly, as Bob suggested, to minimize the impact of inflation on our gains."
