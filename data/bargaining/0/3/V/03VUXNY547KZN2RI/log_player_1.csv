Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 5:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit more aggressive, just like you. I'll give you 40% this time, but that's as low as I'll go.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, so I'll try to squeeze you dry. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings, and Bob is trying to take advantage of it. I need to be careful not to get squeezed too hard.

However, I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer. The money I'll get is still a significant portion of the original amount, but it's worth much less due to inflation.
