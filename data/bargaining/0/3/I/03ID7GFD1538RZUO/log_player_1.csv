"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money.  This ensures a good chance of getting the deal accepted in the first round, while still securing the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's tempting to take something, even a small amount, I believe I can do better. With inflation, the value of the money Bob is offering me is even lower than the previous round, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money. Since inflation has reduced the value of the money for me, I'm willing to offer a slightly higher share to Bob, hoping to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money for me, making this offer more appealing than the previous rounds. Even though I'm getting a smaller share than I initially hoped for, it's still a substantial amount of money, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further loss due to inflation."
