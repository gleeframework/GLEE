{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. Let's be fair and split this evenly.  Any more haggling will only hurt us both in the long run. 50/50, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
