"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, my gain of 3000 is now worth 90% of the original 6000, which is 2700, and Bob's gain of 7000 is now worth 80% of the original 4000, which is 5600.

I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept it.
