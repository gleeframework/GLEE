4500.0,5500.0,It seems we're getting closer.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Time is running out and the deal is getting worse for you.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it down the middle. It's getting risky for both of us to continue.  A 50/50 split seems like the fairest solution at this point.,Alice,5,
