"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. 50/50 seems like the best way to split the money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if 50/50 is the best option for me, considering the inflation rates. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share due to the inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
