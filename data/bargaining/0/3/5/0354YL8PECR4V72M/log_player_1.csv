{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'm offering you a small share now, but remember, the money will be worth less for you in each round. We can work out a more even split later if you agree to this.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a more balanced split right away. Let's start with a 60/40 split. I understand the inflation works against me, but I think a fair deal now is better than risking a worse outcome later. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
