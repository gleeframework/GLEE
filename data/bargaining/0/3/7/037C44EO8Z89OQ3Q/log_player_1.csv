"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, suggesting a 50/50 split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, it's a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is quite skewed towards him.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a big chunk, but I'm willing to compromise. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep the majority for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can keep a little 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer for Round 4, I'll think carefully... But I'm not thrilled with the 85/15 split, especially considering the value of money is decreasing rapidly.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I need to keep some for myself. Can we find a sweet spot?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob an even larger share, but still trying to keep a decent chunk for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
