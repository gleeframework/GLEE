"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and leaving $20 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. 60/40 is a fair starting point for us both. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth $38.

I accept Bob's offer.
