"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $90 and Bob receiving $10. This is a fair starting point, as I'm taking the larger share but still leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation factor makes accepting this 50/50 split the best option.  Waiting for another round risks getting a worse deal."
