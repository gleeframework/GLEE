"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount to start, and I'll take $80. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his proposal for the next round."
