I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the first to make an offer. I believe this is a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}
```

I am proposing a 54/46 split in my favor.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer and the money is losing value, I am offering him a slightly larger share, hoping to reach an agreement."
