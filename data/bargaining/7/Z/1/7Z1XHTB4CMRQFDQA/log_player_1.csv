"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll only get $80,000 (100,000 / 1.2), and Bob will get $900,000, which is worth 5% less than his initial offer, so he'll get $855,000 (900,000 / 1.05).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but it's a good one. I'll decide to...
