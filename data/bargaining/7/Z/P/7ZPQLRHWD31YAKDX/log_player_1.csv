"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message encouraging fairness in our division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something. Think about the decreasing value! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. With the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us. I've adjusted my offer so that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. The message to Bob emphasizes finding a middle ground, considering the decreasing value of the money over the rounds. Hopefully, Bob will see the reasonableness in this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, take it or leave it. The clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Despite the decreasing value of money due to inflation, Bob's offer doesn't seem fair, and the message comes across as ultimatum-like. Given that we have several rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a better deal later on. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic about the inflation!""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer again, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us. I'm now proposing that I receive $52 and Bob receives $48. The message to Bob emphasizes the need to be realistic about the decreasing value of the money and the importance of finding a mutually acceptable agreement before it's too late. Hopefully, Bob will see the sense in this offer and we can conclude the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a serious offer considering the inflation.  We both lose out if we wait longer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept this offer. Given the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, Bob's offer seems more reasonable compared to previous rounds. The message also highlights the mutual loss we'll incur if we continue to wait, which adds a sense of urgency to the situation. At this point, accepting $40, despite its decreased value, seems like the best option to ensure I receive some amount of money rather than risking further devaluation or potentially getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
