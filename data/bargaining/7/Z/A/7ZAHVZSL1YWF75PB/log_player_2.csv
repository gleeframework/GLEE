"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk to start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but let's be realistic. How about a more balanced split this time?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's compromise. I'm willing to give you more, but I need a bigger share to make this worth it for me. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering more, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting this offer would give me less actual value than Alice's initial offer in round 1. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better deal in the subsequent rounds, even with the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and the value is shrinking! I'm proposing a favorable split that reflects the urgency of the situation. Let's settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's try to find a compromise before the money loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This offer is worse than her round 3 offer for me, even though she is framing it as a compromise. The time pressure is on, but accepting a bad deal just because of the shrinking pot is not a winning strategy.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away, hoping she'll offer something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a deal where you get MORE than your last offer after inflation is factored in. Take it or leave it - my next offer will be far less generous.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting frustrated. I'm willing to give you more than your last offer, but I need to keep a significant portion. We need to find a solution before this money becomes worthless. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a tough game, but this offer is simply unacceptable. It's far less than what she offered in Round 3, even after accounting for inflation.  My threat in the last round clearly didn't work as she intended to decrease her offer.  I need to hold firm and hope she starts getting truly concerned about losing everything in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. I'm offering you the same deal you rejected two rounds ago. If you refuse again, you're delusional and are happy to walk away with nothing. Don't let greed cloud your judgment.""}"
