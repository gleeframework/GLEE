"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the total amount, and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, but let's be fair.  This is my counter offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering the offer, I'd rather not accept this offer since I'll be getting a smaller share of the already reduced amount due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now (10% less than the previous round), I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Time to get serious. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
