"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I think this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm going to be greedy. Even though Alice's offer is ""fair"", I want more!  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I know you want a fair split, Alice, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see if you'll agree to this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. The value decreases with each round, and this offer still gives you a significant share. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer to have more, the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Alice's offer is still good, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
