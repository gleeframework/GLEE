"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking 900,000$ and giving Bob 100,000$. I want to maximize my gains in the first round since the money is worth the most now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a bad deal.  Even though I am losing 20% on the money due to inflation,  I will still end up with more money if I reject this offer and get to propose my own in the next round.  I will have a chance to gain more money in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm proposing to keep 800,000 and give Bob 200,000.  I'm still aiming for the most money possible, but recognizing I need to offer Bob more to be competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. Even though I am losing almost 50% of the value of the money due to inflation, I know that if I keep rejecting, I will eventually be able to get a better offer from Bob.  I need to keep playing this game strategically and not give in to Bob's current offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing to keep 600,000 and give Bob 400,000.  I'm reducing my target, as I need to make a more attractive offer to Bob.  We're halfway through the rounds, so I need to strike a balance between getting a good amount for myself and ensuring I don't run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still have to reject this offer.  While inflation is hurting me significantly, I need to play the long game.  If I accept this offer, I'm essentially giving up a significant amount of money. I have to try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. The inflation is taking a huge toll, and I need to be more realistic.  A 50/50 split is fair, and gives us both a decent amount in this late stage of the game.  I need to take what I can get at this point."
