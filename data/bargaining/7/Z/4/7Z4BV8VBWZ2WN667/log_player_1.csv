"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a split of 9000 for me and 1000 for Bob. I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate if he rejects it.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a more even split than my initial proposal,  I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident I can secure more than $5,000 for myself, especially with inflation biting into Bob's gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
``` 

I'm offering a split of 7500 for me and 2500 for Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to ensure a significant share to counter inflation.  Let's see if this is a good starting point for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. Inflation is really starting to hurt Bob's side of the deal, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer with each passing round. It's time to secure a solid gain before things get worse."
