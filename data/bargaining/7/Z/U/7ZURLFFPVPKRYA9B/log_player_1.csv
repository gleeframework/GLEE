"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer is designed to incentivize Bob to accept in the first round.  He gets a small amount, but it's better than nothing if he rejects and the money inflates for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While this offer is tempting, it's better to wait and see if Bob will budge in the next round.  The money is losing value for him, and he might be willing to offer a slightly better split to secure a deal before the inflation hits him harder."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering a slightly better split for Bob than my initial offer, hoping to incentivize him to accept before the inflation further devalues his share."
