"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take the bigger share this round, but you'll have a chance to negotiate in the next one. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current proposal is too skewed in Alice's favor, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Additionally, the inflation rate is higher for me, so I'd like to try to reach an agreement sooner rather than later to minimize the impact of inflation on my share."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. Considering the inflation rates, I think this is a fairer split. Your turn!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've tried to find a balance that takes into account the inflation rates affecting both of us. By giving Alice a slightly larger share, I'm acknowledging her initial proposal and the fact that her inflation rate is lower. However, I'm also ensuring that my share is substantial enough to mitigate the impact of the higher inflation rate on my end. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Alice and help us reach an agreement sooner."
