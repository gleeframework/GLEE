"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. This is my first and final offer. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While I lose money to inflation, Alice loses it much faster. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer still gives you a significant amount, and it's a fair split considering the inflation working against you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage, but she's clearly feeling the pressure of inflation. I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""The inflation is working against you, Alice.  This is a generous offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split this evenly. The inflation is hurting us both. It's time to be rational. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is as fair as it's going to get. Accepting the 50/50 split is the best move now.  While I could try to push for more, there's a real risk that Alice will get desperate and we'll both walk away with nothing.  A guaranteed win is better than a risky gamble at this point."
