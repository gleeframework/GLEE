"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, with me getting 90% of the $1,000,000 and Bob getting 10%. I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time. 60/40 split seems fair.  Accept this and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer, I think a 60-40 split is a bit too skewed towards Bob. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to counter with 55/45, a bit more in my favor.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which I think is a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle at 55.45, a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm sticking with the 55-45 split, but slightly adjusting the numbers to meet in the middle."
