"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept it quickly and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can start with 40 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is now worth less than 50, but still a decent amount.

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split, especially since I don't know how much the inflation affects Bob's gain. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm still looking for a fair deal""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a good deal 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. I'll think carefully about this offer...

With the money worth 48.8% less, my gain of 42 is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept this offer, especially since I don't know how much the inflation affects Bob's gain.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 48.8% less now, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit more aggressive, but I still want a fair deal""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, you're getting low 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. My share is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, especially since Bob is taking a bigger share.

However, I don't have many rounds left to negotiate, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll think carefully about this offer...
