Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money 90/10, with me taking the larger share. I think this is a reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
