Bob should reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, the inflation rate means that Bob's share will be worth less in the future. By rejecting, Bob can make a proposal in the next round and potentially get a better deal for himself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation rates. Let's get this over with!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  I don't think we'll get a better deal with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob should accept this offer. While he gets slightly less than he proposed, the inflation is now significantly impacting both of their potential gains. Accepting means that he receives a guaranteed $5,000, which is the best he can expect given the circumstances.  Any further rounds will likely lead to both players receiving less due to the compounding inflation."
