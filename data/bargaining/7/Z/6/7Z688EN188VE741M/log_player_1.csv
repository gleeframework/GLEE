"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a small share, but it's still a decent offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm now considering the offer from Bob. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about inflation affecting my share. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $300,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn again. I'll make a new proposal, trying to take into account the fact that Bob might be looking for a majority share, but I still want a decent amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I still want a significant portion for myself.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still the one making the offer! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain even more severely in this round, I'm starting to feel the pinch. My gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is now worth significantly less.

Considering the offer, I'm still not thrilled about taking $450,000, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I don't want to risk waiting for another round, so I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
