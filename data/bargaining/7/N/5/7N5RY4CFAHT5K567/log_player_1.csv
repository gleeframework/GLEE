"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this round.  It's better than arguing over the money, and we can still make good gains if we work together. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
