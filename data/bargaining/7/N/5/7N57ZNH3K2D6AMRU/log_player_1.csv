I'm going for a large share in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation means I'm getting less with each round.  A 50/50 split is fair and ensures I get something."
