Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure and the fact that your potential gain diminishes with every round. Let's be sensible and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but the game isn't over yet.  While the decreasing value hurts, accepting an offer where I get significantly less than half feels too risky. There's still time for Alice to get nervous and make a better offer as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this negotiation with a simple, fair solution: a 50/50 split. It ensures a good outcome for both of us given the circumstances and avoids any further losses due to inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** As we approach the halfway point, the pressure is increasing. A 50/50 split leaves less room for negotiation and avoids the risk of a stalemate.
* **Fairness:** It's a clean and justifiable split, unlikely to offend Alice and potentially making her more agreeable.
* **Inflation:**  Every round that passes significantly erodes the value of my potential gain. A 50/50 split secures a substantial amount now."
