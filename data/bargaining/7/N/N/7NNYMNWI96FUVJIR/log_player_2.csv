"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. We can adjust if you prefer a different split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the 10% inflation, I'm willing to take a risk to potentially get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is a fairer split. Let's try to meet in the middle.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We both lose money with each round.  A 50/50 split seems like the best way to maximize our gains now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Due to inflation, the money is worth significantly less with each passing round. A 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round. It's time to finalize the deal!"
