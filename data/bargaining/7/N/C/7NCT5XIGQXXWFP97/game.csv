400000.0,600000.0,"I think we can both do better than an even split.  This offer allows us both to get a good chunk of the money, and I'm willing to take a little less now to potentially get more in the future.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Bob. This balances the previous offer and gives Bob a larger share while ensuring I still receive a significant portion.,Alice,3,
