"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally. It's fair and efficient. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's tempting to take the easy 500k, but since we know inflation is a factor, there's a chance to do better! I'll see what Alice's next offer is."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than an even split.  This offer allows us both to get a good chunk of the money, and I'm willing to take a little less now to potentially get more in the future.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Bob. This balances the previous offer and gives Bob a larger share while ensuring I still receive a significant portion. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd ideally get a larger share, with inflation, I'm concerned about losing a significant chunk of my potential gains. This offer is the best I've seen so far, and taking it now is the safer choice."
