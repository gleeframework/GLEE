Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move closer to your proposal, but I still need a better share than 40%. How about 65% for me and 35% for you? It's a compromise that allows us to avoid further rounds of negotiation and the risk of further inflation.

# Alice gain: 6500
