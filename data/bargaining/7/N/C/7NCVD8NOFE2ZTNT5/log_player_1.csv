"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets $0. I'm being a bit aggressive to start, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to be reasonable!

I'll think for a moment...

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair split, and I'd rather not risk waiting for a potentially worse offer in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
