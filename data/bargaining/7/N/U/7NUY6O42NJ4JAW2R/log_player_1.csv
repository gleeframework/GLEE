"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

I'll calculate the actual values as follows:

My gain: 100,000 * 0.9 = 90,000 (due to 10% inflation)
Bob's gain: 900,000 * 0.95 = 855,000 (due to 5% inflation)

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less in each round, and it's now the third round, the money is worth 90% of the original value (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729).

Here's my offer for round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
