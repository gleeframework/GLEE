"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 40% is a fair deal for me, especially considering the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'll hold out for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share than before. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more to make up for the inflation, but not too much! 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether this is a good deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 38% is a fair deal for me, especially considering the money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I'll hold out for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust my offer to account for the additional inflation, but I'm also trying to get a better deal for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
