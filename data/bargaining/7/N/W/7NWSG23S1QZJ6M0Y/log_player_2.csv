{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fairer starting point, given the inflation dynamic. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is working against me.  I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 isn't fair in the long run.  How about we meet in the middle at 52/48? 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
