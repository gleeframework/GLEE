"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a fair split. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious with my decision. I'd rather not accept an even split at this point, as it might not be the best deal for me in the long run.

I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round. 

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take its toll. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I should take the offer. 58 is still a decent amount, and it's better than risking further erosion of value.

I'll accept the offer.
