Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the most reasonable.  It's better to take a slightly smaller share now than risk getting even less later as the value decreases for you. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52
