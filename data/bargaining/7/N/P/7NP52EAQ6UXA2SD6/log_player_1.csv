"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the initial amount.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $80 and Bob will get $20, which is a relatively fair split for the first round."
