Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the negotiations go. I'm willing to be fair, but that offer is a bit too skewed towards Alice for my liking."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be reasonable, but we need something a bit more balanced.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While that's closer to the middle ground, the impact of inflation is already being felt. I need to push for a better deal before our potential gains shrink even further."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Time is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This offer is a good compromise to reach a fair deal quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting me less, I can wait a bit longer 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the fact that inflation is hurting me more. However, accepting a deal this low would set a bad precedent. I need to hold firm and make it clear I'm not going to be bullied into a bad deal, even with the time pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this money. Let's be realistic: inflation is hurting both of us, though it's hitting me harder. This offer is fair and avoids us losing even more to time.  Don't let greed lead to us both getting nothing!""}"
