Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn again. Considering inflation, this is still a good deal for you 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I think it's still fair to split it evenly.  Inflation is a factor, but let's be reasonable.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating away at your share, I'm being generous by not taking more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't great, with inflation taking its toll, it's the best option to avoid potentially losing even more in the next round."
