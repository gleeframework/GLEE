"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not a perfect split, accepting this offer in round 3 is in Bob's best interest. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to Bob. Accepting now minimizes the impact of inflation.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is unlikely to offer a significantly better deal in future rounds. She knows time is on her side as the inflation affects Bob more severely.

Waiting any longer risks Alice offering even less favorable terms, making this current offer the most logical one to accept."
