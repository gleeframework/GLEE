"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how Alice reacts to a counter-offer. While her offer isn't terrible, I can potentially get a better deal as the money devalues faster for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I think this split is more in line with the devaluation rate. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the devaluation, but I think I can still get a slightly better deal. Let's see if she's willing to move closer to a 50/50 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose if we don't agree. This seems like a fair compromise given the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but time is running out.  Alice is unlikely to move much further, and accepting now is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
