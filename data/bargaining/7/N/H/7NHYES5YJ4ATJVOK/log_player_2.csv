"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. Take this generous offer while it still holds value. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take $100,000, it's a very small fraction of the total.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I believe this is a more fair split.  Let's make a deal and move on.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be fair, Bob, but time is running out. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's better than nothing, and at this point, Alice's offer is worth less with each round. I'll take it."
