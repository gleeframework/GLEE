"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping for a more equal split, and 70-30 is still a bit too far off. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""}

I'm proposing a slightly more equal split, with me getting 75% and Bob getting 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think this is my final offer 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer from round 4. Although I was hoping for a better deal, I think 65-35 is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is willing to give me a bit more. I'm willing to settle for this offer and end the game."
