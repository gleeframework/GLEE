"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a little more fair, considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's try this! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 55-45 is fair, considering the initial offer was 60-40. Can we try to find a middle ground?""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet, and I'd like to see if we can find a compromise that's more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle at 50-50. It's a fair split, and we can both walk away with something.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
