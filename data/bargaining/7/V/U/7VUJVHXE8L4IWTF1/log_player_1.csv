"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think you should take a bigger risk 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm thinking that 70% of the money is still a bit too little for me, considering the risk I'm taking. I'd like to propose a counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more risk, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's meet in the middle.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, which is $80, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $20. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still willing to give you a chance to make a deal. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting desperate, huh?

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm going to take the deal. 85% of the money is still a significant amount, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the future. Plus, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to give me a good deal, so I'll take it."
