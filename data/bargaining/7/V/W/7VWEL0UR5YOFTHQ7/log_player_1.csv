"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and giving Bob $40. I'm framing it as a fair and reasonable starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 5% less, so my gain would be 60% of 95% of the original amount, which is 0.6 * 0.95 = 0.57 of the original amount, or $57.

Bob's offer is 25% for me, which is $25, and 75% for him, which is $75.

I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too low for me. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, so my gain would be 57% of 95% of the original amount, which is 0.57 * 0.95 = 0.5425 of the original amount, or $54.25.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the current value of the money, which is $55, and giving Bob $45. I'm framing it as a fair compromise, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money is worth 14.26% less than the original amount, so my gain would be 60% of 85.74% of the original amount, which is 0.6 * 0.8574 = 0.51444 of the original amount, or $51.444.

Bob's offer is 20% for me, which is $20, and 80% for him, which is $80.

I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too low for me. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the fifth round, the money is worth 14.26% less than the fourth round, so my gain would be 51.444% of 85.74% of the original amount, which is 0.51444 * 0.8574 = 0.4412 of the original amount, or $44.12.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50, and end this.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 50% of the current value of the money, which is $50, and giving Bob $50. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept and we can finally settle on a division."
