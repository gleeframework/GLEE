"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the real value of the offer. 

My gain of 400,000 is actually worth 80% of 500,000 (the original value of the 50-50 split I proposed in Round 1), which is 400,000. So, in real terms, Bob's offer is actually a 50-50 split, which is the same as my original proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
