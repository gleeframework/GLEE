55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a better deal than 40/60. Let's split it 55/45 this time. We're running out of time, and I'm sure we can both walk away with something.",Alice,3,

50.0,50.0,We're getting closer! I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. Let's agree on this and avoid further losses from inflation.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"I see you're willing to go to 50/50, but considering the inflation affecting you, I think I can still get a bit more. How about 60 for me and 40 for you?",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm still willing to compromise, but I can't accept your last offer. Let's split it 45/55.  We're running out of time, and I think this is the best we can do.",Alice,7,

38.0,62.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on your gains, I believe I can push for a bit more. How about 62 for me and 38 for you?",Bob,8,

40.0,60.0,We're both losing money with each round.  I'm willing to take a bigger loss to reach an agreement.  Let's split it 40/60. It's the best I can do with the current inflation.,Alice,9,
