"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can call it a day.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm giving you a slightly smaller share to make it more appealing to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but it's still fair. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to balance the fairness of the split with the fact that the money is worth less and less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I've been generous enough. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll accept this offer, as it's actually more generous than my previous offer, and the money is worth less and less with each passing round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
