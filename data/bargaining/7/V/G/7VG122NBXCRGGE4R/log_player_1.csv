"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a fairly standard starting offer. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to be fair and even. I'll think about it...

I accept the offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a 50-50 split, which seems reasonable considering the inflation. I'll take the deal!"
