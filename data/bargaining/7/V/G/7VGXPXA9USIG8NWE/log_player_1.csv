# Alice gain: 70

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better split, and 30% is still a relatively small share for me. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a more balanced split."

# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, and I think I can do better. 75% is a significant share, but I was hoping for an even more generous split. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if we can find a more balanced split."

I think I've been pushing too hard for a big share, and Bob's offer is a decent compromise. 85% is still a significant share, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation. I think 15% is a fair share for Bob, considering the current value of the money. I'll take the deal."
