"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $40 and kept $60 for myself. I also sent a message saying ""Let's be fair"". Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer. If he accepts, the game ends and we divide the money according to my proposal. If he rejects, he will make a new proposal in the next round. Remember that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less for Bob due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I think this is more reasonable, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I am Alice, I will decide whether to accept or reject Bob's offer. Given the proposal, I think I can get a better deal, especially considering that the money is worth the same for me but less for Bob due to inflation. I will reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nNow it's my turn again. I will make a new proposal for dividing the $100, taking into account the inflation that affects Bob's gain. Let's see if Bob will accept my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I rejected Bob's offer, I will make a new proposal. Considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain, I will try to make a more reasonable offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal""}\n\nI offered Bob $43 and kept $57 for myself. I also sent a message explaining that I took into account the inflation that affects Bob's gain, so I think this is a fair deal. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer. If he accepts, the game ends and we divide the money according to my proposal. If he rejects, he will make a new proposal in the next round, and the money will be worth even less for him due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's end this. A 50/50 split seems like the only fair option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I am Alice, I will decide whether to accept or reject Bob's offer. Given the proposal, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, especially considering that the money is worth the same for me but significantly less for Bob due to inflation. I will accept Bob's offer and end the game.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accepted Bob's offer, and we will divide the $100 equally between us. Although I could have tried to negotiate further, I think a 50/50 split is a fair deal, considering the effects of inflation on Bob's gain. The game has ended, and we have reached a mutually acceptable agreement."
