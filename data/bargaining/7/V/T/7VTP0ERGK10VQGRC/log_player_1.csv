"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000, which is a 80-20 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive in my offer. Will you accept? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $4,000 is worth 95% of $4,000, which is $3,800. Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 90% of $6,000, which is $5,400.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still a bit too aggressive. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This is a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500, which is a 55-45 split. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be more reasonable. Will you meet me in the middle this time? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is worth 85.74% of the original $10,000, which is $8,574. But since the money is worth 5% less each round, and we've had 3 rounds so far, it's actually worth 0.95^3 = 0.8574 of the original amount. So, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth 0.8574 * $5,000 = $4,287. So, my gain of $5,000 is worth $4,287. Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 72.9% of the original $10,000, which is $7,290.

I'm surprised by Bob's offer, but I think it's a good opportunity to take a closer look. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, let's meet in the middle. It's a fair split.""
}
```"
