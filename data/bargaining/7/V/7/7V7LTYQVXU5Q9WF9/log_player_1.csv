"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, let's see if you agree!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving Bob with $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving up much. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give myself a slightly larger share, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's call it a tie, I'll give you equal shares. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more equal split. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of equal shares, $500,000 each. It seems like a fair deal, and I don't want to risk going to another round."
