"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\n\nI'll propose a division that seems fair, aiming for a higher share due to the inflation penalty I incur with each round. Given that the money loses value for me by 20% each round, I'll start with a proposal that reflects a slight bias towards my gain but still appears reasonable for Bob to consider, especially since the value remains constant for him.

```json
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering my inflation penalty.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your penalty is steep, but let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\n\nConsidering the inflation, my gain of $5500 in this round is actually worth less than its face value compared to the first round. However, the fact that Bob is willing to find a middle ground is a positive sign. Given the decreasing value of the money for me, it might be prudent to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.
