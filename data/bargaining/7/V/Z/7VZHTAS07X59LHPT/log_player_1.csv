"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI am offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob. I included the message ""Let's be fair"" to convey a sense of fairness and equality in the division. I am willing to give Bob a substantial amount, but also want to ensure I receive a larger share as the proposer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better split. Let's talk. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation rates. With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob in each round, I think Bob will be more inclined to compromise in the next round to avoid further losses. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI am offering $5500 for myself and $4500 for Bob. I included the message ""Meet me in the middle"" to convey a sense of compromise and willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution. Considering the inflation rates, I believe this offer is reasonable and takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Let's see how Bob responds!"
