I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, considering I am the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant portion of the money. I'm offering an 80/20 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'm not accepting a deal that gives me less than 30% of the money."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm willing to come down to 70/30, but I'm running out of time and the value of the money is decreasing. I'm hoping Bob will see reason and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not going to accept a 30/70 split, especially since the money is losing value so quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to go for a 60/40 split. This is a fair offer considering the inflation and the limited time remaining.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the value of the money plummets further."
