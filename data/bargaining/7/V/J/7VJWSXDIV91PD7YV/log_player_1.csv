"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to maximize my gain while also considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to increase my share while still keeping it reasonable. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is decreasing in value rapidly due to inflation. I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease. However, Bob's offer is a 45-55 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split than my previous offer. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
