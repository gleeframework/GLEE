"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice rejected the 50/50 split, I'll try to get a better deal. Given the 20% inflation, I'll offer a slightly lower amount to Alice, hoping to get a better share for myself.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, Alice's offer is actually a 52.5/47.5 split, which is a bit better for me than the 55/45 split I offered in round 2. I'll accept this offer.
