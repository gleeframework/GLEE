"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can both be happy with this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given that I'll be facing higher inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50/50 is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'm not thrilled about a 50-50 split, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'd rather not risk going into another round with even lower gains.

I accept Bob's offer.
