I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. I want to maximize my gains, but I also want to give Bob a small incentive to accept the deal rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
