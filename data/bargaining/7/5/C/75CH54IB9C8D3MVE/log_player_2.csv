"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a nice chunk to start.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for your advantage in the next round.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to frame the situation as if I have an advantage, but the time pressure and inflation are heavily weighted against me. I need to push for a more significant share while there's still time, even if it means risking a worse offer later."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to the deadline. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to budge a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough decision, and the pressure is on. However, Alice's offer is getting worse, not better! She's clearly trying to exploit the time pressure and the fact that my potential gains are shrinking. I need to hold firm and hope she gets nervous as we get closer to the deadline."
