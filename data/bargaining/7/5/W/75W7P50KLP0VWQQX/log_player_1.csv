"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose that I receive $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000.  This is a very favorable offer for me, considering the potential inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though I'm losing 50% of what I was originally asking for, the inflation will make my earnings even less next round. It's better to accept this offer and secure some money."
