I'm proposing a 90/10 split in favor of me, Alice. It's a big head start for me and gives Bob a chance to get something as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm offering a slightly less generous split than the first round, but still a significant amount for both of us.  I'm taking into account the inflation, but I'm confident I can secure a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 150000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering a 75/25 split, still leaning heavily in my favor, but considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing, this is a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

With inflation hitting hard, I'm lowering my share again.  This 60/40 split is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
