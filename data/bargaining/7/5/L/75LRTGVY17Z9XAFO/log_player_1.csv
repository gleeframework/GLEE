"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a split that's 70% to me and 30% to Bob, especially since I'm not sure how much the inflation affects his perception of the value. I'll try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500,
  ""message"": ""You're being stingy, I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking for a fair split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm just yet. You're still being too greedy. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and I need to adjust my strategy accordingly.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $7,500 and call it a day, rather than risking further erosion of the money's value."
