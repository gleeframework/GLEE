Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll accept it quickly to avoid the risk of getting nothing.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by rejecting and proposing a different split. Let's split it evenly!"
