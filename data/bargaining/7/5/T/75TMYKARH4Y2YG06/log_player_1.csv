I propose Alice takes $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a large majority of the money while still offering Bob a decent sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, which is more equitable than Bob's previous offer.  While I'm willing to compromise, I still need to account for the significant inflation impacting my share."
