Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer to the middle ground 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While her offer is getting ""closer to the middle,"" it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to push this further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 470000, ""alice_gain"": 530000, ""message"": ""This is a compromise, Alice.  Take it before inflation eats away at my share even more, making a deal impossible.""} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm strategically conceding a bit here, but framing it as a limited-time offer due to the looming threat of inflation. This might pressure Alice to accept a deal that's still in her favor, but not drastically so. It's a gamble, but the alternative is risking even worse offers as inflation diminishes my potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance before I take a harder stance 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is running out. Alice's language suggests she's done negotiating and might start lowballing me even more. Accepting now secures me something, even if it's not ideal. Rejecting this offer is too risky with the remaining rounds and the increasing impact of inflation."
