"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split this 99/1. You get a nice little bonus, and I get the bulk. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 10,000 is tempting, it's far too small a share of the money. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than your offer. How about we split it 90/10? I'm sure you'll agree that's a much fairer distribution.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to budge a bit, but 90/10 is just too far. I'm offering 95/5. It's still a good deal for you, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still hoping for a better deal. 50,000 is a bit better than 10,000, but I think I can get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. Let's split it 75/25. It's a fair split, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the end here. I'm willing to go down to 90/10.  It's a good deal for you, and it avoids further inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is the best I've seen so far, and with further rounds, the value of the money I get will likely decrease due to inflation.  100,000 is a significant improvement from the initial offer, and I'm willing to accept it."
