"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual values:

My gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16 (5% less)
Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56 (10% less)

I'll accept this offer.
