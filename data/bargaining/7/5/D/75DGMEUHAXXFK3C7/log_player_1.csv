"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'll start by proposing a division that gives me a significant portion of the money. It's a bit greedy, but I want to see how Bob reacts and whether he's willing to accept a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to have more, the money is losing value with each round. It's better to accept this offer and secure 4000$ than risk getting less in the next round."
