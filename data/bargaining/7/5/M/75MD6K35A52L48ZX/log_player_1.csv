"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the initial $10,000. I'm keeping $6,000 for myself, which is 60% of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I'll have to adjust my decision.

Since Bob's offer is now:

# Alice gain: 5000
# Bob gain: 5000

I'll accept this offer.
