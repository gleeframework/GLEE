"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering the potential for inflation in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000.  This is a more equitable split than Bob's previous offer, and while I would prefer a larger share, I'm willing to compromise to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation has become significant, and this offer at least gets me a decent amount. Accepting this offer is a better option than risking further loss due to inflation in the next round."
