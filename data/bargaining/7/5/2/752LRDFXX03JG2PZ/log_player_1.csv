"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't do much better than this. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, my gain of $60 is equivalent to $54 in the first round, and Bob's gain of $40 is equivalent to $32 in the first round.

Considering Bob's message and the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're being generous, but I'm not getting any younger. I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in, but I'll meet you halfway. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $50 is worth 100 / (1 - 0.271) = 1.3846 times more than in the first round, so it's equivalent to $69.23 in the first round.
Bob's gain of $50 is worth 100 / (1 - 0.488) = 1.947 times more than in the first round, so it's equivalent to $97.35 in the first round.

Considering Bob's message and the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
