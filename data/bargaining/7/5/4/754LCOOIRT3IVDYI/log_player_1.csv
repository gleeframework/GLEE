"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split, with me getting 750,000 and Bob getting 250,000. I'm trying to start with a fair and reasonable offer to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving up 600,000$. However, I also don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
