# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are past the halfway point, and Bob's offers are getting worse for him with each round due to inflation.  He is clearly feeling the pressure. While his offer is tempting,  I believe I can get him to agree to a better split in the next couple of rounds as the deadline looms."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to give you a share, but the value is rapidly decreasing. It's a risky gamble to go on, and we might both lose everything. Let's end this now and secure a small gain.

# Bob gain: 750000

**Reasoning:**

This is a high-stakes gamble! While Bob is clearly panicking, we're approaching the end game.  He's offering me less than his previous worst offer. There's a good chance he'll crack under the pressure in the next round and offer a more substantial amount."
