Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal for both of us in the long run.  Think about how much the money will be worth if we go another round! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take this deal.  The inflation is starting to hit hard, and another round might not be worth it."
