"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as needed""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60% of the initial $100 and Bob 40%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and we can adjust as we go along."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split to compensate for the decreased value. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but I'm still willing to negotiate""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me a slightly larger share of the remaining $100."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be reasonable here - I'm increasing my share a bit more, but we both still get a decent amount.  Let's work together to find a good solution. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! I'm not thrilled about the 65-35 split, but I'm willing to consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less than before, I'll aim for a more aggressive split to make up for the loss in value. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle this round, but I'm not giving up yet""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offers. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
