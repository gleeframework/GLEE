Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to offer a 55/45 split. This way, we both get a decent share, and I account for the reduced value on my end. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the substantial impact of inflation on my end, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This adjustment accounts for the loss in value I'm experiencing, while still offering you a considerable amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is significantly devaluing her potential gains. While this offer is better than her previous 55/45 proposal, I believe I can push for a better deal in the next round. The time pressure is on her more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation is a major factor now.  This offer is my final compromise - it gives me a slight edge while still leaving you with a significant sum considering the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Now that Alice has proposed a 60/40 split in her favor, I need to appear flexible while still maximizing my gain. Offering 55/45 shows I'm willing to negotiate but holds a firm line.  The message emphasizes that this is my final offer, adding pressure on Alice to accept.  Time is running out, and she'll likely prefer a smaller share to nothing at all."
