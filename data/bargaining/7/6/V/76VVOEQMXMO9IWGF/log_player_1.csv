"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, but I'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself as the starting point. I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a bit more to his advantage!

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up more than $4500, and I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. No more negotiations needed!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground and propose a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'll still take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up more than $4000, and I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting desperate, but I'm willing to compromise. Take a slightly smaller share and we can wrap this up.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly larger share and getting a fair deal for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not willing to give me enough, so I'll take what I can get 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get as much as possible!

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up more than $3800, and I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal. I'm starting to think that Bob is being a bit too aggressive, and I'd like to try to negotiate a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. Let's meet in the middle and end this. I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share to get the negotiations moving. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
