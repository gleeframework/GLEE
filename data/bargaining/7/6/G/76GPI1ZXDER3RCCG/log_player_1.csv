"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 300k, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping the rest for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it down the middle. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 500,000 x 0.95 = 475,000
Bob gain: 500,000 x 1 = 500,000

I'll accept Bob's offer.
