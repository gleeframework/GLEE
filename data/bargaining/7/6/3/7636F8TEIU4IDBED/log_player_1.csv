  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to keep the game interesting.""

Round 2

# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: $7,000 (pre-inflation) × 0.95 = $6,650
