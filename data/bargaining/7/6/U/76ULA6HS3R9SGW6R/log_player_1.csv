"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $480,000. 

Bob's offer is still $450,000 for me, which is worth 90% of the original amount I was offered, so it's actually a better deal than the one I made in the first round.

I'll accept this offer.
