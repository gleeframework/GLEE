"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly higher share, but still fair, I think! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 3000$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 2850$.

I'm not thrilled with the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll think about it for a moment...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of inflation!""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust for the inflation effect and propose a new split that's a bit more favorable to me. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
