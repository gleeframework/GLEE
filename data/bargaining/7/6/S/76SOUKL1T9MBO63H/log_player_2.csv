Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each passing round, I want to try to get a bigger share to compensate for the loss in value. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
