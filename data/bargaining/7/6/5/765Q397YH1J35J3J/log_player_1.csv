Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is more balanced considering the inflation. Let's close this deal now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. The value is decreasing rapidly for both of us. Let's settle this now and each get something reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Dwindling Returns:**  The inflation is severely impacting both players.  Delaying further significantly erodes the value of the money, especially for Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries the risk of Bob offering even less in a future round, where the overall value will be lower. Accepting guarantees Alice at least $60 (though its real value due to inflation is closer to $42).

It's a tough decision, but the rapidly decreasing value of the money makes accepting Bob's offer in round 4 the most pragmatic choice to ensure Alice receives a reasonable share."
