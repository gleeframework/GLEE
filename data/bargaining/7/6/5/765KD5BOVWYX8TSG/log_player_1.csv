"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the split. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money by 20% from the first round, the total amount is now effectively $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8). However, since Bob's offer in the second round was based on the original $10,000, I'll consider the effective amount for his gain as $6,000 (6000 / 0.8).

With that in mind, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```"
