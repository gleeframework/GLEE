Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer with a slight adjustment, considering the inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. We're losing value quickly, so let's avoid another round. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since we've both had a chance to make offers and the value is decreasing, I think it's best to accept the even split to maximize my gain before the value drops further.
