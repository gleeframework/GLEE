Let's see what I can do better!  I'll take the lead in round 2."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going for a much larger share in this round. It's risky, but I believe I can get a better deal than Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is a bit better than her first one, but it's still not enough for me. I'm going to continue playing and see if I can get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try and increase my share again. I believe Alice will be more inclined to accept a deal where she gets something rather than nothing, especially with inflation starting to affect her too."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting better, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'm going to take this deal before the value of the money drops even further."
