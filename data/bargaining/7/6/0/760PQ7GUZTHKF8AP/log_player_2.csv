Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I want a deal now before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's better to take what I can get now before the money depreciates further."
