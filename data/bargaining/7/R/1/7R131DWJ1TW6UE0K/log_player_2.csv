**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to get a better deal while the inflation eats away at the overall value.  I need to push for a more significant gain before we run out of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 530000, ""alice_gain"": 470000, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Alice. Take 470,000 before it shrinks even more!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

- **Time pressure:**  With each round, the value diminishes significantly. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
- **Slight concession:** Offering 53/47 shows a willingness to compromise slightly from the previous 52/48, but it's still a better deal for Bob than Alice's last offer.
- **Direct message:**  The message conveys a sense of urgency and slight frustration, hoping to push Alice towards accepting a reasonable deal."
