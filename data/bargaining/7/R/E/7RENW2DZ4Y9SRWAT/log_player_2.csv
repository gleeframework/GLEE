"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take most of the money, but you get a decent share.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to see if Alice will offer more in the next round.  Even though I'm only gaining $1000, the potential for a better deal in the next round is worth the risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. While I'd prefer more, a 3000 gain is decent, and Alice's offers are likely to get worse with each round due to her inflation penalty. It's time to take what I can get."
