Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, let's see! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less now.

I'll think about it... I don't want to give Bob 700,000$. I'll reject the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer.

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the new values considering the inflation...

My gain of 450,000$ is worth 51.2% of the original 600,000$ I proposed in round 1, so I'm getting closer to my original target. However, I still want to negotiate.

I'll reject the offer.
