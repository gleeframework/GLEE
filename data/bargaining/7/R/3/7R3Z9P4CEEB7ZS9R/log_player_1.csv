"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and my message to Bob is that we can start with an even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you can have a decent chunk too. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to think about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more attractive offer this time. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now (10% less in each of the two previous rounds), I'll propose a smaller amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I need some for myself""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to be too generous 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less for me now, and Bob is still trying to take the majority. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, since the money is worth even less for me now. I'll propose a smaller amount for Bob, but I'll also make it clear that I'm not going to give him everything.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting it all, but I'm willing to give you most of it""
}
