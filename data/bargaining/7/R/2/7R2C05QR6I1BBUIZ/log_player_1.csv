"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the original $10,000. I'll get $6,000, which is a 60% share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $5,400 in the second round.

I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle, as it's a 50/50 split, which is not as favorable to me as my initial offer. However, I'm willing to compromise. I accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
