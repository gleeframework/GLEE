"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent share, but don't expect me to go easy on you. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm not going to accept such a low offer right away. Let's see what else Alice is willing to do."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. I'm proposing a more even split. Let's see if you're willing to be a bit more fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not getting any younger, and I need a bigger share to secure my future. Meet me in the middle, or we'll be back to square one. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I don't want to risk getting nothing. This offer is significantly better than the first round, and I don't want to push my luck too far."
