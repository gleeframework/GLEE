"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to try to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair. Let's not waste time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's 50/50 split seems reasonable, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but can we do 55/45?""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and suggesting a 55-45 split in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
