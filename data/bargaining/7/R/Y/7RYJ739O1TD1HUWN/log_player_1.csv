Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is fairer, reflecting our equal roles in this negotiation. Let's get this done.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise.  This offer is closer to my desired split, but we need to move quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Reasoning: Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his 60/40 split, even though the value is decreasing significantly. I need to show I'm serious about getting a better deal, especially with the time pressure.  We're getting into risky territory, but I think I can still get him to move closer to a more even split."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding of inflation. This offer shows a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair way to end this. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Reasoning: Bob is now just mirroring my offers back to me after letting a round pass, hoping I'll panic and accept a worse deal due to the time pressure. I need to hold firm and show him I'm willing to go further if he doesn't negotiate in good faith."
