"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair - I'm proposing a more even split.  This way, we both get a substantial amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
