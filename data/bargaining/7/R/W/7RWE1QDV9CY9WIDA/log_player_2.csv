"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical - I'll take the lion's share, but you still get something.  Let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While the offer is tempting for a quick resolution, it's a very unequal split.  I'm not sure about Alice's ""practicality"" in this game, but I'm going to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair - I'm proposing a more even split.  This way, we both get a substantial amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.""
