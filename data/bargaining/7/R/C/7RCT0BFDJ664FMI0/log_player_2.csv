Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share due to inflation 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation, but this offer is still tilted in her favor.  While she loses value faster, getting only 40% when her initial offer was 55% isn't a good deal for me. I need to push for a more significant shift in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking.  My offer reflects the rapidly shrinking pie.  Let's be realistic.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting me more, so I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 39 
# Alice gain: 61 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is getting desperate, but this is not good enough! Her offer is barely better than before.  With each round, the value shrinks significantly, particularly for her. I need to hold firm for a much better deal, knowing she's running out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer or we both lose everything. ""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

It's time for a power play. I'm significantly increasing my demand to highlight the urgency. Alice's offers are barely budging, and she's running out of time. By now, she should realize that a smaller share is better than nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing my share, I need a bigger cut 
# Bob gain: 37 
# Alice gain: 63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is cutting it extremely close, but I have to be realistic.  While Alice's offer is still far from ideal, accepting guarantees me something. If I reject this, there's a high chance we'll both end up with nothing due to the rapid inflation, especially on Alice's side. It's a gamble I'm no longer willing to take."
