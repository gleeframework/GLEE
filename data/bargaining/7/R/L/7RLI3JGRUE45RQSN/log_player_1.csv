"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial proposal
I will start by proposing a division that slightly favors me, Alice, but still offers Bob a significant amount to consider accepting the offer in the first round. Given the total amount is $100, I'll propose taking 60% of the money, which is $60, and offer Bob 40%, which is $40.

### Step 2: Consider the message to Bob
The message to Bob should be persuasive and encourage him to accept the offer in the first round, especially considering the impact of inflation in subsequent rounds. The message will highlight the benefit of accepting early to avoid the devaluation of money.

### Step 3: Construct the proposal in JSON format
The proposal will be constructed in the required JSON format, including the amounts for both Alice and Bob, along with a persuasive message.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept now and avoid losing value to inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's not let this money depreciate any further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer considering inflation
Given that the money is worth 20% less in this round, Bob's offer of $45 for me (Alice) is actually equivalent to 0.8 * $45 = $36 in the value of the first round. Similarly, Bob's gain of $55 is worth 0.8 * $55 = $44 in the first round's value.

### Step 2: Compare the offer with the potential future outcome
Considering the impact of inflation, if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. I need to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential for a better offer in the future, keeping in mind that the money's value decreases by 20% with each round.

### Step 3: Make a decision based on the current offer and future prospects
Given that Bob has made a relatively generous offer and considering the depreciation of money, it might be advantageous to accept this offer rather than risking a less favorable outcome in subsequent rounds.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
