"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you get 20%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, but it's a relatively fair starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. 50/50 split is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but considering the inflation, I'd like to negotiate further. The $500,000 I'd gain is worth 80% of what I could have gained in the first round. I'd like to aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. I'll propose a 60:40 split in my favor.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a higher share, Bob. 60% for me and 40% for you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, Alice. 45/55 split is a good middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger hit, I need to be more cautious. However, a 45/55 split is a reasonable compromise, and it's still a relatively high share for me. Considering the diminishing value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
