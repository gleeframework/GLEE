"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take less, you take less. We can both walk away happy.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous offer considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and we can move on with the game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the larger share, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. The money is already worth less due to inflation, and I'm not sure if I want to give up more of the remaining amount.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $440,000, which is a slightly smaller share than before, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."
