"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and leaving Bob with $2,000. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can split the money fairly without too much haggling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Your turn to accept or reject! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 20% less than it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $3,200.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm looking for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of $4,000 in the previous round is now worth 20% less, so it's worth $3,200. I'll aim to increase my share this round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,500 in the previous round is now worth 48.8% less, so it's worth approximately $2,833.60.

I'll accept Bob's offer. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise.
