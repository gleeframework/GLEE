  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the initial offer was 7:3. I'll give you 20% of the total. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
