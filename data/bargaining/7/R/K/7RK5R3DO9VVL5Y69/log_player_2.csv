"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but I'll give you a chance to negotiate more in the future if you want. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want a better deal. Even though it's a small amount, I'm willing to risk losing it to see if I can get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to share more, but I need a better deal than what you offered. Let's be more equitable this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need to get something back from the last round.   
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, I'm taking this offer. The inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
