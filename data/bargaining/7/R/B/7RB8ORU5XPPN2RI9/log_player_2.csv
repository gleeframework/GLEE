"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer accounts for the time value of money. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Determine the adjusted value of money for Alice due to inflation.
Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less for Alice, we need to calculate the adjusted value of the money for her in this round. Since this is round 2, the money is worth 5% less than in round 1.

### Step 2: Calculate the adjusted total value of money for Alice in round 2.
The original amount is $1,000,000. For Alice, in round 2, the value would be 95% of $1,000,000 because it's 5% less than in round 1.

### Step 3: Decide on a fair division considering the time value of money.
Given the adjusted value for Alice, we aim to make an offer that is slightly more favorable to her than the previous offer to account for the decreasing value of money, but still aims to maximize Bob's gain.

### Step 4: Calculate Bob's and Alice's gains based on the decision.
Considering the adjusted value and aiming for a slightly more favorable offer for Alice, let's propose a division that reflects this consideration. If Alice's adjusted value is 95% of $1,000,000, then her perspective value is $950,000. Aiming for a division that slightly favors her more than the previous offer, let's propose 52% for Alice and 48% for Bob of the original $1,000,000.

### Step 5: Formulate the message to Alice.
The message should reflect the consideration for the time value of money and the adjusted offer.

### Step 6: Finalize the offer in JSON format.
Calculate the exact amounts for Bob and Alice based on the percentages decided and formulate the offer.

The final answer is:
```
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Considering the time value of money and its decreasing value for you, I propose this division.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm losing value with each round. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 485000 
# Alice gain: 515000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the impact of inflation on Alice's offer.
In round 3, Alice's money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. This means that her $515,000 is actually worth less when considering the inflation.

### Step 2: Calculate the adjusted value of Alice's gain.
Given that Alice's money is worth 9.75% less, we calculate the adjusted value by multiplying her gain by (100% - 9.75%).

### Step 3: Consider the implications of Alice's offer for Bob.
Since the money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round, his $485,000 maintains its original value.

### Step 4: Decide whether to accept or reject Alice's offer.
Considering the adjusted value of Alice's gain and the maintained value of Bob's gain, evaluate if the offer is fair or if there's room for further negotiation.

### Step 5: Formulate the decision in JSON format.
Based on the evaluation, decide whether to accept the offer or reject it and proceed to the next round.

The final answer is:
```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
