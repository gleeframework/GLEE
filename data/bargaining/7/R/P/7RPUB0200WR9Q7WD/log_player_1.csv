Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to try to get a better deal this time.  $800,000 for me and $200,000 for Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I would gain, it's better to take $200,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
