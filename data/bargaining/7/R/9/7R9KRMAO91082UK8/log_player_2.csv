Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and it's depreciating fast.  I'll come up slightly to 52/48. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Here's why accepting is the best choice in Round 3:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, waiting longer will only result in smaller gains for both of you.
* **Alice is Conceding (Slightly):**  Alice moving from a 55/45 split to a 52/48 split shows a willingness to negotiate. It's unlikely she'll move much further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in future rounds carries a significant risk. If Alice gets impatient, she might offer even less favorable terms later.

While getting a slightly larger share is tempting, the risk of losing more value due to inflation makes accepting this offer the most rational choice."
