"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's a good starting point for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'd be getting $950,000 if I accept this offer.

Considering Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll reject it for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is now worth 90.25% of its original value, so I'd be getting $900,750 if I accept a proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Accept and we can move forward.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a slight increase from my initial offer, but still a relatively small amount for him."
