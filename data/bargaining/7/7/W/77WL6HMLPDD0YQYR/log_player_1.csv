I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small portion to encourage him to accept and avoid risking further inflation."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
