"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. What do you think?""
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's a relatively fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the offer this round. How about we split it 5-5? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I need to be careful not to give up too much.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation effect. Since I'm getting 5000, that's worth 95% of what I would have gotten in the first round, but it's still a relatively small share of the total amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. I'll aim to get a larger share of the money, but still keep it reasonable.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more risk. I'll give you 3000, and I'll take 7000. You can either accept or try to do better next round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to the original 5-5 split. How about we meet in the middle at 5,500 for me and 4,500 for you? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 14.26% less, which is a significant decrease. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept, especially since I'm getting a smaller share than before.

However, I also don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
