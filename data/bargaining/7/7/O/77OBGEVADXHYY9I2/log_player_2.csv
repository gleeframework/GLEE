"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 70/30. It's a fair deal considering the inflation effect. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early to accept a 30/70 split. There are 11 rounds left, and the value of money will decrease significantly. I want to see if I can get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. With inflation, the value of money will decrease, so it's better to get a bigger share now.""}
