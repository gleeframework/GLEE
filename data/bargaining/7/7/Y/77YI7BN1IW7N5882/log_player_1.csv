"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share to start with, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something.  It's a risky strategy, but I'm banking on Bob's greed not being too extreme."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount.  The inflation rate makes holding out risky, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
