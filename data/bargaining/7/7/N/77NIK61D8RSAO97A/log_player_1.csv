"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, but I'm also trying to keep the majority of the money for myself. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. I'll take 550000, you get 450000. We both get a decent amount, and we can end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $900,000 from the first round is still worth $900,000, but Bob's $100,000 is now worth $90,000. His new offer is more equitable, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm willing to give up that much. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you $300,000 and keep $700,000. This is a fair split, and we can end this now.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and giving Bob a reasonable share. Let's see what he has to say!"
