Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a slightly greedy approach, but leaving Bob with a tiny amount to hopefully encourage him to accept the offer.  I want to maximize my gains in the early rounds, since the inflation will hit me hard later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I get a very small amount, it's better than nothing.  The inflation is going to hit me hard, and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the future rounds.  I'll accept and take what I can get."
