"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will be willing to take a small amount rather than risk getting nothing in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing in the next round. The 5% inflation means the money is worth less with each passing round, so it's in my best interest to secure a share now."
