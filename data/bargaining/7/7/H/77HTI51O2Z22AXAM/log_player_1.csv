"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split. I want to maximize my gain, but I'm also aware that Bob needs to feel like he's getting a fair share to be motivated to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than the 5% less I would get from my initial offer, I still believe I can get a better deal. I will reject and try to negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my share to 600,000. This still leaves Bob with a significant portion of the money, but it's a more equitable split considering the inflation we've experienced. I believe this offer will be more appealing to Bob than his previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting less than I initially hoped for, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and Bob's offer is closer to an equal split than the previous rounds. It's in my best interest to accept and secure a share of the money before further inflation diminishes its value."
