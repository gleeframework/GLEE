I'm going for a large share, but I'm leaving Bob a little something to encourage him to accept. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a clear power play, but I'm not going to give up that easily. I'll reject and see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm still aiming for the majority of the money, but I'm increasing Bob's share a bit to see if I can entice him into accepting. Inflation is hitting my potential gains hard, so I need to find a balance between being greedy and getting something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty bad, and inflation is really hurting my potential earnings. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but not by much.  Inflation is really making it tough, and I need to get this deal done soon. I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the value in accepting, even with a smaller share."
