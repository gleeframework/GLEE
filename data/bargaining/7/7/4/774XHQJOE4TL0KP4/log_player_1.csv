"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can finalize.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 30-70 split is fair, especially considering the money is worth less with each passing round. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 42-58 split, hoping Bob will be more willing to accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much. This is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 45-55 split is the best I can get, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'd like to try to negotiate further and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you at 48-52, Bob. Is this a deal?""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a slightly larger share, hoping that Bob will be willing to accept this compromise."
