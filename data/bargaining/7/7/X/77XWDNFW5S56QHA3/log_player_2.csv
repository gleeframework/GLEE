Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation on your end, I've adjusted my offer. This should still be favorable to me while accounting for your loss. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is diminishing rapidly for me. Accepting this 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the value is decreasing for you, but I still believe I deserve a larger share. This is my most generous offer yet. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, the value of the money is decreasing so rapidly for Bob that waiting any longer will result in an even worse outcome. Accepting Alice's offer, while still favoring her, secures him a reasonable amount before inflation further erodes his potential gains.
