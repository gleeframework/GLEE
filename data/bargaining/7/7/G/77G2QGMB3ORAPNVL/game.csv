500000.0,500000.0,I propose we split the $1000000 evenly. It's fair and ensures we both get a substantial amount.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not splitting it 50/50. You can do better than that!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Considering Bob's last offer, I propose a new division where I receive $600000 and you receive $400000. This is still a fair compromise given our previous offers.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"You're not budging, I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still in the driver's seat here!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,I believe in fairness. My proposal is for me to receive $550000 and you $450000. This division respects the principle of equity while maximizing the amount received by both parties.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"You're getting desperate, I'm taking a bigger share now. Your turn to think twice!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Considering the dynamics of the game, I propose a division where I receive $400000 and you $600000. This maintains a balance between fairness and maximizing my share.",Alice,7,
