I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money. I figure Bob might be willing to take a smaller share in the first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, taking 80% is still a good deal, especially with the inflation factor. Bob's offer is significantly better than what he offered in the previous round, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal later."
