"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you take 10%. Hopefully we can find a better compromise later! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me only 10% of the money! I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly. I'm sure we can both do better than taking such a small portion.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let's split it 60/40 this time.  We're losing money with each round, so let's find a solution before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with that offer. While it's an improvement, I believe I can get a better deal if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need a fair share. Let's split it 60/40 this time, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.""}
