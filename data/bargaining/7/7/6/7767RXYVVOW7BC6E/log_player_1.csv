"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be friends!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a friendly note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the deal, or we'll play again 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $400,000 I would gain is now worth less than the $500,000 I could have gotten in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance to make a deal, Alice 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the $300,000 I'd gain is a significant decrease from the $500,000 I could have gotten initially.

I'll think carefully before making a decision...

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is getting intense! With the inflation eating away at my potential gain, I need to be strategic.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close to the edge, Bob. Meet me at this point!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm still willing to compromise to try and end the game."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, the $200,000 I'd gain is a significant decrease from the $500,000 I could have gotten initially.

I'm running out of options, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value. I'll take this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
