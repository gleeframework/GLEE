Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This accounts for inflation and is as fair as it gets! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and the rate of inflation is working in my favor. While her offer is starting to get tempting, I believe holding out for a slightly better deal in the next few rounds is still the optimal strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm sticking with an even split.  This is the fairest option, especially considering the inflation working against you.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While I could push for a slightly larger share, Alice is likely getting desperate. Sticking with the fair 50/50 split might be the best way to ensure she accepts before inflation eats away too much of her potential gains."
