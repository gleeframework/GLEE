"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000, and I'll take $8000. You can't do better than this, can you?""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's both take half and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The 50/50 split is indeed a fair proposal. With the inflation adjustments, the money is worth less than before, so I'll accept this offer.
