Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try an even split this time. It's clear we're not going to agree on a big difference, and the money is losing value with each round.  A fair split seems like the best way forward. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
