"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's try 55 for me and 45 for you.  It's a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I'm ready to give up yet!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to make a counteroffer."

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 50-50 seems like a fair compromise. Let's end this here.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to find a middle ground that might appeal to Bob."
