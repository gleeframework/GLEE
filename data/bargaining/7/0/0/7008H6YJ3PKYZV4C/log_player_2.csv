"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. I'm offering you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000.  It's better to settle now than lose value in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'll reject this offer.  It's a decent starting point, but I think I can do better by waiting and seeing what Alice offers in the next round. The money is worth less to Alice in the next round, so she might be willing to offer me more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The money is worth less to you in each round, so it's in your best interest to accept this offer before it's worth even less.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a 50/50 split this time. This is a fair deal, and it's the best you'll get. The value of the money is decreasing for me with each round, so let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, the money is losing value for Alice faster than me.  A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better to accept now than risk losing even more in future rounds."
