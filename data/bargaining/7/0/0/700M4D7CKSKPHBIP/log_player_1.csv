"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This is a classic strategy in these scenarios: offer the other player the bare minimum to secure their acceptance. Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, it's best to be as greedy as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more than half, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  We only have 12 rounds, and each round increases the risk of getting nothing. Bob's offer is generous, and accepting it guarantees a substantial amount of money."
