I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  I'm hoping to secure a large share early on, but I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a 60/40 split, recognizing the inflation and Bob's previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping to avoid further rounds of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm offering a 40/60 split,  adjusting to the ongoing inflation and Bob's insistence on a larger share. While I'm losing a significant portion of my initial goal, I believe this is the best option to avoid further rounds and secure at least some of the money before it's worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is tempting due to the significant inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a larger share.  Rejecting this offer keeps me in the game and allows me to make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 250000, ""bob_gain"": 750000}
```

I'm offering a 25/75 split.  The inflation has taken a huge toll, but I'm still hoping to get a reasonable share.  This offer is a compromise, but I'm willing to risk another round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is seriously impacting my potential gains. While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best way to secure *some* money.  There's a high risk of getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers."
