I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a good starting point, as it's a pretty fair offer considering I'm the one taking the risk of inflation in this scenario.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though I'm losing 30% of my potential gain compared to the first round, it's still better than risking another round of inflation and potentially getting a worse offer."
