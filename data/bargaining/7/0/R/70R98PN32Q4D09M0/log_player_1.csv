"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering I'm taking the risk of the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less.

Considering Bob's message, I think he's trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm more risk-averse. However, I'm not convinced that 60/40 is a fair split.

I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make an offer again. Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to be more aggressive this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a bigger risk, I'm taking the bigger reward""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, hoping Bob will be more cautious and accept my offer."
