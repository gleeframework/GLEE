"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A 70/30 split seems fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The 70/30 split doesn't seem fair to me, considering the significant impact of inflation on my share. I'd like to propose a different division that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer.\n\n###\n\nCan I proceed to make an offer now? What is the current value of the money after the first round?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the impact of inflation, I'd like to make an offer that balances our gains while taking into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground considering the inflation rates. This split should be more fair as the rounds progress.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice.\n\n###\n\nWaiting for Alice's response..."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is hitting you hard. I'll be generous and take a bit less than last round, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nThe inflation is indeed impacting my share significantly, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. Given the decreasing value of money, I'd like to make another counteroffer that considers the current worth of the money for both of us.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make the next offer.\n\n###\n\nCan I proceed to make an offer now? What is the current value of the money after the third round?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the impact of inflation on both of our shares, I'll make an offer that tries to find a balance. Since the money is worth significantly less to me now, I'll aim for a split that reflects the current value. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Given the substantial decrease in value for me, a 50/50 split seems more reasonable at this point, considering the compounded inflation effects.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice.\n\n###\n\nWaiting for Alice's response..."
