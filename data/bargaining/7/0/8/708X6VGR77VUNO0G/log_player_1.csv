I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor. This feels like a fair starting point, as I'm the one making the offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a larger share, the money is losing value with each round. A 50/50 split ensures I get at least half, and the inflation will be significant if we keep going. It's time to take the deal."
