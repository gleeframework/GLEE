Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I understand your point about balance.  Let's try a more even split. This is a compromise, but we still have time to work out a more favorable deal if we're both willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster rate of inflation on my end. While a 60/40 split in her favor might seem tempting, it's still heavily skewed considering the money will be worth significantly less if we wait too many more rounds.  I need to signal I'm willing to play hardball to get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It acknowledges that dragging this out hurts me more than you, but it's still a reasonable offer considering we both lose everything if we fail to agree.  Time to be realistic.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying urgency:**  The message emphasizes the time pressure and the need for Alice to be realistic. 
* **Slight concession:** I've reduced my demand slightly from a 60/40 split to 55/45. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not drastically.
* **Anchoring:** By consistently aiming for a share above 50%, I'm hoping to anchor Alice's expectations around that point."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing out by playing this game. Let's cut our losses and agree to a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I was aiming for a slightly higher share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice:

* **Significant Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting any longer significantly erodes the potential gains, even if I could secure a slightly better deal.
* **Fairness Argument:** Alice is now using the ""fairness"" of a 50/50 split to her advantage. Rejecting this could make me seem unreasonable and might push her to play harder to my detriment in later rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a 55/45 split is a risky gamble.  There's no guarantee Alice will agree, and we'd be in a much worse position if the negotiations fail completely. 

A 50/50 split, while not ideal, ensures a reasonable payout given the circumstances."
