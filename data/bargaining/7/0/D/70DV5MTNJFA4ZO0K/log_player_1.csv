"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a large share (9000$) while still giving Bob a small amount (1000$).  I hope this encourages him to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer gives me something, it's a drastically smaller amount than what I proposed in the first round.  I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially since the money is now worth less due to inflation. I will counter with my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. This offer is still significantly better for me than Bob's offer, and I hope it encourages him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than his previous one, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. However, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll continue negotiating in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still aiming for a majority. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I believe a more equitable split is still possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me, even with the significant inflation. I'm determined to get a better deal. I will continue negotiating in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob.  The inflation is really hurting, but I'm still trying to reach a fair compromise."
