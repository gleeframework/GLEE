I've included a message to justify my proposal, suggesting that I'm being fair but also want a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is decreasing quickly with inflation, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money is decreasing for me due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
