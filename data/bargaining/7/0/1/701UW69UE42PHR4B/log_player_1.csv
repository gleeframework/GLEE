"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  It's unlikely Bob will accept, but it sets up a clear pattern for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999998, ""bob_gain"": 2}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still keeping the offer heavily in my favor. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to cave easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 999998 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  He's mirroring my strategy from the first two rounds, so I'll keep rejecting until he gets serious about making a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999997, ""bob_gain"": 3}
``` 

I'm continuing to increase my share slightly, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3 
# Bob gain: 999997 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm sticking to my strategy.  Bob's offer is still too lopsided, and I'm confident that we'll reach a more equitable split in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

It's time to make a significant shift. We've both been playing a game of chicken so far. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This shows I'm serious about finding a solution and that I value fairness. If Bob rejects this, we're rapidly running out of time and the risk of getting nothing becomes very real."
