"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not giving away too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial $100, which is $30, and I'll take the remaining 70%, which is $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving away too much? I'm willing to take a fair share, but I'm not afraid to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll consider the adjusted amounts.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
