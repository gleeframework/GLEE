**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While the value of the money is decreasing for me, it's crucial to remember that getting something is still better than nothing. However, accepting a deal this low would set a dangerous precedent and signal to Alice that I'm willing to accept unfavorable terms.  

It's a risky move, but I'm hoping that by continuing to reject her offers, she'll realize time is also running out for her to secure any deal at all."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it, or we both walk away with nothing.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and the value of the deal is decreasing rapidly. While Alice has been playing hardball, there's a real risk that we'll reach a point where even her desired share won't be worth accepting due to inflation. 

By offering her the same split she initially proposed, I'm calling her bluff.  It sends the message that I'm willing to walk away, but also offers a reasonable way for both of us to benefit before inflation erodes the value further."
