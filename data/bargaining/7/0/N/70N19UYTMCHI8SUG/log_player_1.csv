"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, my share is actually 40 * 0.9 = 36. This offer is less favorable to me than the previous one, but I'll consider it. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
