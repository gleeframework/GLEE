"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your initial offer, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by inflation as Bob is.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer. It's not the best deal, but it's a decent compromise."
