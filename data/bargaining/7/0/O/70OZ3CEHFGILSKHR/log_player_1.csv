"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. Since the money's value decreases for Bob with each round, I believe this offer is reasonable and gives him a good incentive to accept early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you value fairness, Alice, but the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. I'm proposing a 70/30 split to compensate for the decreasing value of the money over time. This way, we both get a decent share, even considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear the clock is working against me.  However, I need a split that reflects the initial value we're dividing. This offer is a compromise to settle things fairly before the inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
