"Round 1

This seems like a decent offer at first glance, but it doesn't fully account for the rapid inflation affecting me. While a 40/60 split seems fair in a normal scenario, I stand to lose a significant chunk of my potential earnings with each round that passes. I need to aim for a larger share to offset the inflation disadvantage."

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I understand you value fairness, Alice, but the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. I'm proposing a 70/30 split to compensate for the decreasing value of the money over time. This way, we both get a decent share, even considering the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I've adjusted my offer slightly. This way, we both benefit from ending the game early. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting worse! She's using the inflation to her advantage, knowing my position weakens with each round.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it's risky."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear the clock is working against me.  However, I need a split that reflects the initial value we're dividing. This offer is a compromise to settle things fairly before the inflation eats away at the value any further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The longer we play, the more the inflation hurts your share. I'm willing to end the game now with a slightly bigger share for myself, but still a reasonable amount for you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to be realistic. The value of my potential winnings is plummeting with each passing round. If I reject this offer, I risk getting even less in a future round. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, which is better than holding out for a better deal that might never come."
