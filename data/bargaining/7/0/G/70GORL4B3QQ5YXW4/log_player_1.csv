"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. It's still a good deal for me! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, $3,000 is equivalent to $4,000 in the first round. That's not a bad deal for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
