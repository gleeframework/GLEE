"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 
I propose a 5500/4500 split.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in getting a guaranteed 4500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject.  I'm hoping to get a better deal than that.  The inflation isn't too drastic yet, and I'm willing to wait."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in a fair division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to bite.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and further rounds could result in an even worse deal for me."
