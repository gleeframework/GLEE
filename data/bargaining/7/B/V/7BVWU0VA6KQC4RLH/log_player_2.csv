"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This ensures you get a fair share while I get slightly more for starting the negotiations. It's a good deal for both of us before inflation diminishes the value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's be fair, I take a slightly larger share this round acknowledging that you initiated the negotiation.  This way we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but letting inflation eat away at the value benefits neither of us. I'm proposing a 52/48 split - closer to your offer, but still recognizing my initial proposal. Let's close the deal before we lose more. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
