"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%. This way we both get a decent amount and can still have a chance to negotiate further.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the original $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's actually $160,000.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the significant difference in our gains. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I've adjusted my offer to give you a slightly larger share. I'll take 55% and you can take 45%. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation, and I'm aiming to get a slightly larger share than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm making a strong offer 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $100,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, so it's actually $51,200.

I'm getting desperate, indeed! This offer is a very low share for me, considering the original amount. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. I'll take 30% and you can take 70%. It's a significant concession, but I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This offer is a significant reduction from my previous offers, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
