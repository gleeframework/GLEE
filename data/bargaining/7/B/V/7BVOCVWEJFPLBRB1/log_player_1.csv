# Alice gain: 2000

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the value of the money is decreasing for both of us."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer because, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk waiting for a better deal that might not materialize."
