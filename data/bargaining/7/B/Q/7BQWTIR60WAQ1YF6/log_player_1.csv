"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way, and we both get a decent amount before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
