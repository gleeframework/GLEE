"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90/10, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 60/40 split. This is a more even distribution and shows good faith. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to factor that into my decision.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, considering the inflation hit I'll take. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, given the inflation adjustment. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now worth 95% of the original amount.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more. Let's try 70/30.""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust my proposal to reflect the decreasing value of the money and also to try to get a better deal for myself."
