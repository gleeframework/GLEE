"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 90/10, I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what a better offer looks like!  I'm not happy with 10% of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 60/40 split. This is a more even distribution and shows good faith.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more. Let's try 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, with inflation hitting my share hard, accepting a 30% share is better than risking getting even less in the next round."
