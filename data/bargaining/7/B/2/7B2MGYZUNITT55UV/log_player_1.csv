"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a pretty good split, if I do say so myself!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

In this round, the total amount of money is still $10,000, but it's worth less due to inflation. Since I'm offering $6,000 in the first round, I'll aim to get a similar amount in this round, considering the reduced value of money.

I'll reject Bob's offer because I can do better than splitting it evenly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! You won't get a better deal than this.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's end this and split the money equally. Inflation is hurting us both, and this is the best way to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of money, Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Since I've been trying to get a higher share, I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less in this round, I'll aim to get an even higher share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8400,
  ""bob_gain"": 1600,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Take this or face the consequences!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  We can split the money more fairly, but if you keep rejecting, we'll both end up with less due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really crippling the value of the money!

Considering the massive reduction in value, Bob's offer seems like a decent compromise. I've been trying to get a higher share, but it seems like Bob is trying to make a fair split. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
