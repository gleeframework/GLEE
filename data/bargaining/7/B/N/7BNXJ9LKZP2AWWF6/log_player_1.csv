"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I'm worth more than 1/4 of the total. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'm now considering a gain of 7,000 to be equivalent to 8,000 in the first round.

I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial proposal, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give him a larger share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less again, so I'm now considering a gain of 6,100 to be equivalent to 8,000 in the first round.

I'll make a new offer that's slightly more aggressive, but still reasonable.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You think you're worth more, but I'm not convinced. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still lowballing me. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give you the whole pie. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is now worth significantly less for me. A gain of 4,500 is equivalent to 6,000 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm starting to get worried that I might end up with a very small share if we continue to negotiate. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
