"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. A 50/50 split is fair and reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the $10,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and then another 10% less due to the second round, so it's worth 81% of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm still in a strong position, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own gain.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice, but I think I deserve a bigger share. I'm making a fair offer, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $7200 is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I think he's trying to take advantage of the situation and get a larger share. I'm not sure if I want to give him $6,000, especially since I was hoping to get a larger share earlier.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

However, I'm starting to get worried about the value of the money, and I don't want to risk losing everything. I'll accept Bob's offer from round 6.
