"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick win. I'll be watching the inflation closely!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change in the distribution. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a significant portion for myself.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fairer compromise after his last proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential earnings, accepting this offer is the best option. Holding out any longer risks even lower returns for me due to inflation, and it's unlikely Bob will offer me more."
