"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you 20% of the money, let's see if you can do better""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, hoping to get a good starting point and give Bob a chance to think about a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving away too much yet 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my thinking.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth 10% less now, my gain of 400,000 is actually 400,000 / 0.9 = 444,444.44 in real value.

Bob's gain of 600,000 is still 600,000, but it's worth the same as before.

I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less again, my gain of 400,000 is now worth 400,000 / 0.9 = 444,444.44 in real value. I'll aim to get a better deal this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You didn't give me enough last time, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. My gain of 450,000 is actually 450,000 / 0.713 (1 - 0.287) = 630,000 in real value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Bob's gain of 550,000 is still worth the same as before.

However, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 27.1% less again, my gain of 450,000 is now worth 450,000 / 0.713 = 630,000 in real value. I'll aim to get a better deal this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still willing to give you a good deal, don't push me too hard""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think this is the best I can do 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. My gain of 500,000 is actually 500,000 / 0.5915 (1 - 0.4085) = 846,147 in real value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. A 50-50 split is a fair deal, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I think I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we go to the next round.
