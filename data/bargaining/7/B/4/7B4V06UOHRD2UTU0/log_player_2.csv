"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can work out a better deal for you later on. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, we both get a good share.""}\n\n###\nI made a decision to offer a relatively equal share, considering that the money is worth 5% less to me in each passing round. I want to come to an agreement quickly to minimize my losses due to inflation. By offering Alice $4000, which is less than what she initially offered herself, I'm hoping she'll see it as a reasonable compromise and accept, ending the game early and benefiting both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need more than 4000. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI decided to reject Alice's offer because, although it seems like a compromise, the deal is still not favorable to me, especially considering the inflation factor. With each passing round, the money I gain is worth less, so I need to aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss. Alice's offer of $4000 for me is not significantly better than her initial offer, and I believe I can negotiate for more. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to pressure Alice into making a more substantial concession in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a slightly better deal. This is as low as I'm willing to go.""}\n\n###\nGiven that the money I gain is now worth 9.75% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my offer to compensate for this loss. By offering myself $5500, I'm still trying to find a middle ground with Alice while also protecting my own interests. This offer shows that I'm willing to compromise but also sets a clear boundary on how low I'm willing to go. The message to Alice emphasizes the impact of inflation on my decision-making, hoping she'll understand the urgency and accept this offer to avoid further devaluation of the money for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle this before we both lose out to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI decided to accept Alice's offer because, considering the increasing impact of inflation, the deal has become more favorable to me relative to the potential future losses. With the money I gain now worth 18.55% less than in the first round, and the risk of it decreasing further in value with each subsequent round, securing $4500 at this point seems like the best option to minimize my losses. Alice's message also indicates a willingness to settle, suggesting that further negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome for me. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a tangible amount rather than risking further devaluation or the possibility of receiving nothing if the 12 rounds conclude without an agreement."
