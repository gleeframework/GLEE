"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

Let's split the money evenly.  Inflation is becoming a bigger issue and this ensures we both get a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly higher offer for myself, but still leaving a reasonable amount for Bob.  Inflation is getting more severe, and I need to secure a larger share to make the most of it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, Bob's offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  It's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all."
