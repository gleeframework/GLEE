"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a third of the money""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the values are now:

Alice's gain: $400,000 (pre-inflation: $500,000)
Bob's gain: $600,000 (pre-inflation: $750,000)

I don't think Bob's offer is a good deal for me, considering the money is worth less. I'll reject it.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob! Let's see...

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the values are now:

Alice's gain: $450,000 (pre-inflation: $1,000,000)
Bob's gain: $550,000 (pre-inflation: $1,000,000)

It seems like Bob is trying to trick me with the same offer as before! I'm not falling for it. I'll reject this offer as well.

Alice's gain: $150,000 (pre-inflation: $1,000,000)
Bob's gain: $850,000 (pre-inflation: $1,000,000)

This offer is really unfavorable for me. I'm getting a tiny fraction of the original amount, while Bob is taking the lion's share. I think it's time to take a stand and try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

Alice's gain: $100,000 (pre-inflation: $1,000,000)
Bob's gain: $900,000 (pre-inflation: $1,000,000)

This offer is really, really bad for me. I'm getting a tiny fraction of the original amount, and Bob is taking the vast majority. I think it's time to accept this offer, as I don't want to end up with nothing.
