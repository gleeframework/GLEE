"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer seems fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself. I'll reject and see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money 60/40 in my favor. After all, I'm the one making the offer this round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money 55/45 in your favor. This still allows you to gain more while being fair. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would love to get more, I'm losing value with each round due to inflation. This offer is more favorable than my last round's offer, and I'm unsure if Alice will offer more in the next round. I'll take the 450,000."
