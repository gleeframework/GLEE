"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's share fairly, considering the inflation, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a fair-sounding deal in the first round,  it's important to consider the inflation rates. Alice's offer is favorable to her, and I can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to share fairly, but I think a 60/40 split is more equitable given the inflation rates. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This is a more balanced split, given the decay of value. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still better for her, and the inflation is working against me. I need to push for a more equitable split. I'll reject this offer and try for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""The inflation is hurting us both, but I believe this split is fair considering the situation. We need to come to an agreement soon to avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value rapidly. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

The inflation is hitting hard, but I still believe I can get a better deal. Alice's offer is still slightly skewed in her favor. I will reject and try to get a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
