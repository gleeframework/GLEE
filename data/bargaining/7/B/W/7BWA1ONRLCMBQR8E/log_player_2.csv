"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is good for me right now, I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'll see if I can get a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a slightly larger share this time, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This offer still gives you a good chunk, and time is running out with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would still like to get a slightly larger share, I need to be mindful of inflation.  Accepting this offer will secure me a decent amount, and the risk of getting nothing is becoming increasingly real."
