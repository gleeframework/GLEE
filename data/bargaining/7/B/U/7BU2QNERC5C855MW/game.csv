70.0,30.0,Let's split 70/30.  I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation working against both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 60/40.  I'm willing to give you a little more since inflation will hit you harder.,Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but that offer is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - 65/35.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's split it down the middle.  Inflation is hitting us both hard now, so a 50/50 split is the fairest option.",Bob,4,
