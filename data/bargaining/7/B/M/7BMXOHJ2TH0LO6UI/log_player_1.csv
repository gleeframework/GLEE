Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is a fair starting point, as it's closer to an even split than your previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement! 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
