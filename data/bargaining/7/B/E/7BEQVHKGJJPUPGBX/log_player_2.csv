"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair split, let's start with a decent amount for both of us 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 4000$ gain is tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not sure how Alice is affected by inflation, so I'll try to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. This way we both get a good chunk and we can avoid the inflation hurting our gains further.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice has compromised, I'm still not happy with the deal. I believe I can get a better offer if we continue negotiating. I'll see if I can get a closer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""I understand your desire for a larger share, but I believe a more balanced split is fairer considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle and both benefit from this division.""
