"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. This seems like a reasonable starting point, considering we both want a share of the money. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a friendly way to initiate the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer is more in line with the game's rules and the fact that your potential gains decrease faster. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, although my potential gains decrease faster, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to find a compromise that benefits me more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway""}\n\nConsidering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll propose a division where I get $5250 and Bob gets $4750. This offer takes into account the decreasing value of my potential gains and attempts to find a middle ground. The message ""Meet me halfway"" conveys my intention to compromise and reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's close this deal. This is a slight improvement on your previous offer, and time is running out for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in the value of my potential gains due to inflation (48.8% less than in the first round), I think accepting this offer is the best decision. The difference between Bob's and my proposed offers is relatively small, and further negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome for me. It's time to close the deal and secure the remaining value."
