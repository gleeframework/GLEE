"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I have an incentive to delay the agreement to get a better deal in subsequent rounds. Rejecting the first offer gives me the opportunity to propose a division that is more favorable to me in the next round, taking advantage of the fact that the money's value remains constant for me but decreases for Alice. This strategic approach aims to maximize my gain by leveraging the asymmetric impact of inflation on our valuations of the money."
