"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 3:1 is a good starting point""
}
```

I'm offering to take 75% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $250,000. The message is a friendly way of framing the offer, implying that 3:1 is a reasonable and fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 3:1, I'll give you 4:1, but I'll keep more for now 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's counteroffer is a bit more generous, but I'm not sure if I want to give him even more. Considering the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $800,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly lower split to account for the reduced value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, 5.5:4.5 is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 45%. The message is a friendly way of framing the offer, implying that we're finding a mutually acceptable middle ground."
