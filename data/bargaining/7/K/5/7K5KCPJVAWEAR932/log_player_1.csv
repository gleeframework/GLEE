Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's keep it simple and fair: 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer was slightly better for him in the first round, accepting a 50/50 split now is the best course of action.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Waiting any longer erodes the value of the money.  Another round means we both get even less.
* **Fairness:**  Bob's offer is fair. Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of getting a worse offer later. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer an even split again if I reject. He might propose something less favorable."
