"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the money, and I'll take 80%. It's a good starting point, and we can negotiate further if you'd like.""

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for Bob, his offer is less attractive than it initially seemed.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for an even better deal.
