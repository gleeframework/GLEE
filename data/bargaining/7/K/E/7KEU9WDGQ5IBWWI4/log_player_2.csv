"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI made this offer taking into account that with each passing round, the money loses value due to inflation. Since the loss in value is greater for me (20%) than for Alice (5%), I've adjusted the offer to reflect this, while still aiming for a more balanced split than the initial offer from Alice.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Alice accepts this offer or if we proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nBest,\nBob\n\n###\n\n"
