"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $200,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $190,000. Since I'm not getting a better offer, I'll accept Bob's proposal.
