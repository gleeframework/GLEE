Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more fair split. Let's aim for something closer to 50/50. This round, I'll take 60, but next round I'll be willing to give up more if you accept. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
