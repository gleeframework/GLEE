"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $5,500 and give Bob $4,500, with a message encouraging him to accept and end the game early to avoid losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I need a bit more to accept. This offer is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I see you want a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a bit more than my initial offer, but still trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
