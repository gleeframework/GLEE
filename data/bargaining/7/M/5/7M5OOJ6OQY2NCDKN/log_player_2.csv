"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. This is a fair deal, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't seem quite fair to me. Let's see if we can find a better division.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal. I'll think of a more balanced offer.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to clarify, since we're in the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, right? It's still the full 1,000,000 dollars that we're dividing?\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to the next step!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that I think is more reasonable. Since the money loses 10% of its value for me with each passing round, I'll try to find a balance that takes this into account.\n\n###\n\nHere's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a fairer split. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice and let me know her response."
