5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, my friend, I understand the inflation is a concern.  Let's meet in the middle for a deal -  $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you.  This gets us both a decent amount before the money dwindles further.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This time, I'll take a bit more. It's now or never, the money is losing value fast.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The longer we wait, the less we both get. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's take it before the money is worth even less!",Alice,5,
