"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too aggressive, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."

It looks like Bob has finally met me in the middle! I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we can finally agree on something!"
