I'm going for a large share to start, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with this offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, especially since the money is losing value faster for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 6000, which is more than what Bob offered me.  I hope this will convince him to accept.  The money is losing value quickly, so I need to get a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this isn't my ideal outcome, it's better than nothing. The money is losing value quickly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  I'll take the $4,500 and move on."
