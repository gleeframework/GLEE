600000.0,400000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60% and you take 40% - a fair deal considering the inflation working against me.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation working against you. Let's make this quick and get the money divided!",Bob,2,
,,"That's quite cheeky, Bob, trying to flip my offer after I made a concession. Let's be reasonable, the inflation doesn't justify such a drastic swing.",Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to 55% for me and 45% for you.  This accounts for the inflation but keeps things fair.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to come up to 55% for you, Alice.  Let's keep things moving and finalize this deal.",Bob,4,
,,"This is getting ridiculous, Bob. You're just trying to stall and take advantage of the inflation. I'm offering a fair deal, let's not waste any more time.",Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm dropping my offer slightly again to 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you.  This is more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation. Take it or leave it, but let's decide now.",Alice,5,
