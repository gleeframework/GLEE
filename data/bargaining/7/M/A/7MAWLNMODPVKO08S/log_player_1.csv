Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor, Alice. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and with each round the value of the money is decreasing. I'll take it!"
