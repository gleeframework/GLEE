I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept quickly.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to accept this offer. Even with the inflation, I'm getting 50% of the money, which is a lot better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
