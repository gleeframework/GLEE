"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn. This offer accounts for the decreasing value over time. Let's be reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's not really accounting for the significant devaluation we face each round.  Let's settle this fairly before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer before the money shrinks even further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're approaching a critical point.  This offer gives you a decent share considering the shrinking pot.  Let's be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While time is running out, accepting this offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of the initial value. Alice's perception of the money's value is decreasing much faster than Bob's. It's worth pushing for a better deal a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  Take this deal or the pot shrinks even further. It's becoming pointless for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it down the middle and get something before it's completely worthless. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the most reasonable outcome at this stage.  Alice is unlikely to accept anything less favorable to her, and the value of the money for both sides is rapidly decreasing. Accepting ensures Bob gets something rather than risking getting nothing at all if the rounds run out."
