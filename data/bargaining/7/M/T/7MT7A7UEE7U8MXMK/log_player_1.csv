"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a seemingly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick win. I'm assuming Bob is unaware of the inflation, so this deal should be appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with inflation, Bob's offer is still significantly better than the previous round's offer. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent share of the money."
