Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer to a potential agreement, it's still heavily in her favor considering the faster rate of inflation affecting my share. It's worth risking another round to try for a better outcome."
