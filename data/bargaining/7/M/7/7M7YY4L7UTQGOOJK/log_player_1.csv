"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I think 60-40 in my favor is a fair start.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is essentially the same as my original offer, but with the labels flipped. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer that's identical to my previous one, especially since I know the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll try to do better next time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger share, before the money loses more value!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $450,000, and I'll take the remaining $550,000."
