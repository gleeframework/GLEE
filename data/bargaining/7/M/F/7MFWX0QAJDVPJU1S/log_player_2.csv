"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start off on a fair note. This seems like a reasonable split to me. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current split doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to see if I can get a more favorable proposal. The 5% decrease in value for me is a risk I'm willing to take for now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that I think is more reasonable, while also considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. This split takes into account the depreciation of the money for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is working against me faster, but your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. This offer still gives you a good deal considering the depreciation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still don't think this offer is fair, considering the rapid depreciation of the money for Alice. I'll take the risk of proceeding to the next round, hoping to get a better offer or make a more favorable proposal myself. The 9.75% decrease in value for me is still a risk I'm willing to take."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing depreciation for both of us, I'll try to find a balance that might be more acceptable to Alice while still being favorable to me.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Given the rapid depreciation, especially for you, I'm willing to adjust my offer to make it more mutually beneficial. Let's compromise before the value drops further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the value is dropping quickly.  I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant depreciation of the money for both of us, especially for Alice, this offer seems more reasonable. The difference in the split is not as significant as before, given the decreasing value. I'll accept this offer to ensure we both get something before the value drops further or we run out of rounds."
