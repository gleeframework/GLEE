"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split. Let me know what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my 50-50 split is no longer as attractive.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to do better this time. Considering the inflation, I'll offer a bit more to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is pushing for a larger share.

Considering the inflation, my gain of 4200 is still worth the same, but Bob's gain of 5800 is now worth less than my gain. I'll think carefully about this new offer...
