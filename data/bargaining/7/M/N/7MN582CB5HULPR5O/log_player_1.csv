"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This means I'm offering to take 700,000$ and leave Bob with 300,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

In this round, I'll gain 400,000$ and Bob will gain 600,000$. Considering the reduced value of money, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept it.
