Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took the lion's share last time, now it's my turn. I'll give you a small share this time, but I expect a better deal next round. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than what you offered. Let's split the difference.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to being fair, but I still think I deserve more. This is my last generous offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has significantly impacted the value of my potential gain, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the next round. Bob seems to be getting increasingly confident, and I don't want to push my luck further."
