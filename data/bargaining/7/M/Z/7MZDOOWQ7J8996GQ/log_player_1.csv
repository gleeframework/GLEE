This is a tough situation, but it's better to take something than nothing.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We are running out of rounds, and the inflation is severely eating into my potential gains.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob has shown no willingness to negotiate fairly.  He's banking on me panicking as the deadline approaches.
* **Future Loss:** If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Bob will offer even less next round, and I'll be forced to accept an even worse deal or get nothing. 

While $300,000 is far from ideal, it's the most logical choice given the circumstances."
