4750.0,5250.0,"Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. I'm willing to be generous, but this needs to be more balanced for us to agree.",Bob,2,

5750.0,4250.0,"I see you're willing to be generous, but I think I can do a bit better. Let's try to meet in the middle.",Alice,3,

5000.0,5000.0,This is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's just agree on this and move on.,Bob,4,

5800.0,4200.0,"I know you think 50/50 is fair, but considering the inflation is affecting your share more, I think I deserve a bit more.",Alice,5,

5300.0,4700.0,"Alice, this isn't going anywhere. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share than 50/50 to account for the time pressure, but my patience is wearing thin.  This is my final offer.",Bob,6,

5900.0,4100.0,"You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. The inflation is really eating into your share, and I think I can get an even better deal.",Alice,7,

5300.0,4700.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm making the same offer again because it's clear you're not negotiating seriously. Take it or leave it â€“ we're running out of time.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I'm not backing down. You're getting desperate, and the inflation is killing your share. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. Last chance before I start getting really greedy.",Alice,9,
