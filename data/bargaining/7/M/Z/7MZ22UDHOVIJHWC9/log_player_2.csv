Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know you think 50/50 is fair, but considering the inflation is affecting your share more, I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the inflation against me, but her offer is getting worse!  I need to hold firm and make it clear I'm not going to accept an increasingly unfair deal.  I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds to get a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Alice, this isn't going anywhere. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share than 50/50 to account for the time pressure, but my patience is wearing thin.  This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:** I acknowledge Alice's point about the inflation affecting me more. By offering 47/53, I show a willingness to compromise but not be exploited.
* **Firm ultimatum:**  The ""final offer"" statement creates urgency and signals I'm serious. This might push Alice to accept rather than risk getting nothing if we reach round 12.
* **Psychological pressure:** By staying relatively close to my 50/50 stance, I maintain the moral high ground of ""fairness"" while applying pressure on Alice to finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. The inflation is really eating into your share, and I think I can get an even better deal. 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation. She didn't budge much from her previous offer, proving she's not negotiating in good faith. I need to stand my ground; otherwise, she'll keep pushing for a worse deal. I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds where the stakes are much higher for both of us.  This might make her reconsider her aggressive approach."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm making the same offer again because it's clear you're not negotiating seriously. Take it or leave it â€“ we're running out of time.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Repeating the offer:**  I'm reiterating my previous offer to highlight Alice's unreasonable behavior. This shows I'm serious and unwilling to be swayed by her attempts to stall and exploit the inflation.
* **Stronger language:**  The message is more direct and accusatory, calling out her lack of seriousness. This increases the pressure and emphasizes the urgency of the situation. 
* **Calculated risk:**  While there's a risk Alice might call my bluff, it's a gamble worth taking.  With each round, the potential losses for both of us increase. By now, she should realize dragging this out only hurts her chances of getting anything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not backing down. You're getting desperate, and the inflation is killing your share. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. Last chance before I start getting really greedy. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but I need to be realistic. Here's why accepting is the least risky option at this point:

* **Alice is getting bolder:** She's gone back to her initial offer and is threatening to be even ""greedier."" This suggests she might be willing to let the entire deal collapse to try and intimidate me.
* **Time is running out:**  With only 3 rounds left, the inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. Waiting any longer is incredibly risky.
* **Minimizing losses:**  While 40% isn't ideal, it's better than walking away with nothing. Accepting now cuts my losses and avoids the possibility of Alice completely lowballing me in the remaining rounds. 

It's frustrating to ""lose"" this negotiation, but Alice played a ruthless game exploiting the time pressure and my aversion to risk."
