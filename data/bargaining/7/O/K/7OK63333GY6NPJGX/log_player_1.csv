"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to keep the vast majority of the money, offering Bob just $1.  This is a risky move, but it's a high-stakes game. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider his next proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than my initial one, but I'm still going to reject. I believe I can secure a better deal for myself.  The game has just begun!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a significant share, but still keeping a majority. This should be attractive enough to tempt him, especially considering the potential for further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but I'll accept.  Inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me, and I'm unlikely to get a better deal if I reject this offer. While I'm disappointed with such a small share, it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
