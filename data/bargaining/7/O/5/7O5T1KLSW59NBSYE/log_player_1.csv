"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair starting point, as I'll be taking a risk with the inflation in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is more favorable to me than the previous one, I'll consider it. However, I still think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round, hoping to get an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a significant portion to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
