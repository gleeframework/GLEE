"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going for a very generous offer in the first round. I figure Bob might be surprised and accept, especially since he doesn't know about the inflation yet.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my first offer, and while the inflation does hurt, it's still not worth accepting this.  I'll reject and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to get a little closer to my initial offer.  Bob seems stubborn, but I'm hoping this time he'll realize it's better than risking another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is even worse than his last one!  I'm going to reject it and hope I can get a better deal in the next round, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

Bob's greed is getting out of hand. I'm lowering my offer a little more, but I'm still holding out for a fair share. He's going to have to realize he's pushing his luck."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous! Bob's offer is worse than any of his previous ones. I'm rejecting it and hoping he finally realizes we're not going to agree on this until he's more reasonable. I'm not sure what's happening with inflation, but I'm pretty sure I'm losing a lot more money than he is!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm still trying to get a fair share, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm not going to let Bob completely take advantage of me.  Let's see if this is enough to break the stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is still not great, but I'm getting a little desperate.  I'm losing a huge amount of money with every passing round due to the inflation, and at this rate I'm going to end up with nothing.  I'm accepting this offer, but I'm not happy about it!  Hopefully, Bob will learn his lesson and be a little less greedy in future negotiations."
