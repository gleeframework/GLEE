"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to gain more. Considering the 10% inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share is worth 19% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my expectations accordingly. Since Alice's offer is still 55, which is worth the same as in the first round, I'll take it.
