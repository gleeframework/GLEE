"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 50/50.  It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation is affecting my end. I'll stick to my guns and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Considering the inflation is still affecting my end, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal this time. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more this time, but I think we both deserve a decent share.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really biting now!

Considering the offer from Bob, I realize that I'm not getting a great deal. The money I would gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, and Bob is still getting a larger share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Considering the inflation is really taking a toll on my end, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the lost value. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal this time. I'm taking control of the negotiations!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm not sure what's going on with your offers, but this is my final offer.  It's more than what you're currently getting.  Let's end this and move on. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling my purchasing power now!

Considering the offer from Bob, I realize that I'm getting a very small share of the total amount. While it's true that this is more than what I would get in the previous round, it's still a relatively small amount considering the initial $10,000. I'll accept this offer, as I don't want to risk getting an even smaller share in future rounds.
