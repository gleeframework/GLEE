"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a smaller share this round""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm also giving him a chance to accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better solution where we both benefit more. Let's negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure why Bob is offering me such a small share, considering the money is worth less now. I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share""
}
```

This offer is slightly more generous to me than my previous one, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to meet him halfway."
