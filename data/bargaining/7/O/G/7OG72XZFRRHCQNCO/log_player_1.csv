I'm going for a very lopsided split.  I want to see if Bob will accept a tiny amount in the hopes of getting a better deal in later rounds, or if he'll reject it and try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I didn't get the vast majority of the money, a 50/50 split is still a good outcome considering the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree.  It's also a good starting point for future negotiations if we play again."
