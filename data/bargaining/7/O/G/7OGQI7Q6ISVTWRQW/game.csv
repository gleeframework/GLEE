,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm the one making the proposal this round. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. You can still do better!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need a larger share to justify the risk of moving forward. How about a 65/35 split?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"I'm not going to give away too much, but I'll try to be more generous. You're not getting 65% of the pie, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I'm getting tired of this back-and-forth.  This time, I'm proposing a 70/30 split. It's fair, considering I'm taking on more risk. If you want to keep playing, I'm not sure how much longer I'll be willing to negotiate.",Bob,6,

200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, we're getting dangerously close to the end.  I'm going to give you one last chance.  I'm willing to split the money 80/20 in my favor.  If you reject this, we both walk away with nothing. It's your call.",Bob,10,
