  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly suggestion to end the game early, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the new values are:

Alice's gain: 855,000 (900,000 - 5% of 900,000)
Bob's gain: 735,000 (700,000 - 5% of 700,000)
