Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob. Waiting any longer means accepting even less in real terms.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly aiming to maximize her gain and is likely aware of Bob's disadvantage with inflation. She's unlikely to offer anything significantly better in future rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk. If Bob rejects and Alice doesn't offer a better deal in the next round, he'll be forced to accept even less due to inflation. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting the offer in Round 5 cuts Bob's losses and avoids the risk of getting a worse deal later."
