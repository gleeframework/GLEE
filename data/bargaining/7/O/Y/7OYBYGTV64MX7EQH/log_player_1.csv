"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to keep almost everything for myself, giving Bob just $1. This is a risky move, but I'm hoping it will incentivize Bob to accept quickly and avoid the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  it's better to take a fair share than risk getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
