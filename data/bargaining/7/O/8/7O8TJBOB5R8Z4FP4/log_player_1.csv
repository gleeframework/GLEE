"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair.  This will give me a slightly better deal, but still leave you with a significant portion. Let's get this done before inflation bites us both! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
