Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty generous offer considering the inflation will kick in soon. Let's see if Bob takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a more equitable split, it's not worth risking another round of inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, even though it's a significant decrease from my initial proposal."
