"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'll start by being generous, but I want to keep the majority of the money. I figure Bob might take it, or at least think about it. I'll be ready to offer less next round if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round. He's already shown he's willing to play hardball."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my share a bit more this round, but I'm still trying to hold onto most of the money. Bob seems to be aiming for a larger share, so I need to make a counter-offer before he gets too greedy. I'll be ready to adjust further in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is basically the same as my offer from the previous round, but with the inflation applied. I'm not going to accept a deal that's essentially the same as the one he rejected last round. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm making a significant concession this round, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. Bob seems to be prioritizing getting a higher percentage, so I need to offer him a decent amount to incentivize him to accept.  We're running out of time, so I'm going to need to be flexible but also firm in my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is sticking with his pattern of offering a slightly altered version of my previous offer. I'm not going to give in to this. I'm confident I can secure a better deal, even with the increasing inflation.  I'll try a different approach in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm trying to be flexible while still prioritizing a larger share. Bob seems to be pushing for an equal split, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll keep offering him a significant amount to incentivize him to accept."
