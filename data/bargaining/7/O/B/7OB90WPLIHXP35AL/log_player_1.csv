"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. A 50/50 split is fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. A 50/50 split is indeed a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 5% less again!

Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Bob, but still keep a larger share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I need a significant share to make this worthwhile.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, Alice. This 60/40 split is a fair middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out. I'll think carefully about it, but I'm leaning towards accepting this offer. The 40% I'll get is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even lower value.
