Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic ultimatum game, and I'm going to play it strategically.  I'm offering Bob a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept the offer rather than risk getting nothing in future rounds. However, I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with this outcome, it's a much better deal than risking getting nothing in future rounds. The inflation effect is significant, and I'm likely to get an even worse deal if I reject and propose in the next round."
