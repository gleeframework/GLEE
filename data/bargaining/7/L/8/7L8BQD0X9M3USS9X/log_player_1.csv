I propose a 90/10 split, giving me 900,000 dollars and Bob 100,000 dollars. I'm aiming for a large share, but still leaving something for Bob to potentially accept in the first round.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'm getting a much smaller share than I initially proposed, it's still better than getting nothing. Plus, Bob is taking a bigger hit from inflation than I am. This seems like a good deal for me considering the circumstances."
