"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a toll on my potential gain.

I'll analyze Bob's offer and decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still keep some room for negotiation."
