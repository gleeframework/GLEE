"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the money, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, the actual amount he's offering me is 5000 * 0.8 = 4000. But the amount I'm getting is 5000, which is worth 20% more than the original 5000, so it's actually 5000 * 1.2 = 6000.

I'm getting a better deal than I would in a 50/50 split, so I'll accept this offer.
