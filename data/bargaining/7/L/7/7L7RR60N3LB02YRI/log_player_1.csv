"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I take a bit more""}\n\n### AI: Round 1\nMy proposal is to take $6000 for myself and give Bob $4000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation difference.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to calculate the real value of the offer. The original $10,000 is now worth $8,000 to me (20% less). Bob's offer of $4,000 for me would be 50% of the original amount I could have gotten in the first round, but due to inflation, it's actually less valuable now.\n\nHowever, considering the decreasing value of money with each round and the fact that Bob's offer is not extremely unfair given the inflation difference, I should consider the potential loss in future rounds if I reject this offer.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will reject the offer because I believe I can negotiate a slightly better deal in the next round or make an offer that Bob might accept, taking into account the increasing loss due to inflation for both of us.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### AI: Please let Bob know that I rejected his offer and wait for the next round where I will make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### AI: Round 3\nGiven the rejection of Bob's offer and the increasing impact of inflation, I need to make an offer that considers the reduced value of money for both of us but still aims to find a mutually acceptable split.\n\nFor this round, the original $10,000 is worth $6,400 to me (20% less than the $8,000 in round 2) and $7,200 to Bob (10% less than the $8,000 he would have considered in round 2).\n\nI will offer a split that slightly adjusts for the inflation difference but still tries to find a middle ground.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the split to find a middle ground.""}\n\n### AI: My proposal is to take $5,500 for myself and give Bob $4,500, with a message acknowledging the impact of inflation on our negotiations. Let's see how Bob reacts to this adjusted offer."
