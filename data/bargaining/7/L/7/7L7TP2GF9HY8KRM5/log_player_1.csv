"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, a fair and simple division to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money's value decreasing, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering a slightly biased split in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly! I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is very close to the initial 50-50 split, and considering the decreasing value of money, I'll accept this offer.
