"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm going to start with a strong offer, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%. I'm assuming he'll be happy with something, and I want to establish myself as the dominant player early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 5000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round. Bob's offer is fair and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal."
