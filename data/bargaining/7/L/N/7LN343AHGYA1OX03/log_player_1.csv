"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to keep 60% as I rejected your last offer. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I think it's too unfair. I'll reject it and try to make a better offer in the next round.

{
""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. Let's meet in the middle!""
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a reasonable balance."
