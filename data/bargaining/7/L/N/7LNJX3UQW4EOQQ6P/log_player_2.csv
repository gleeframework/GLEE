"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's just the first round, and I'm not in a hurry to accept a slightly uneven split. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor this time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose money with each round, so this seems like the best way to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, an even split seems like a reasonable offer at this point. Continuing to negotiate could lead to further losses in the value of the money, so I'll accept this offer to ensure we both get something worthwhile."
