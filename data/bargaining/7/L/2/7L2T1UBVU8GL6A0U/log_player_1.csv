"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money equally.  We both benefit from a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

My gain of $5000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4500 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer, as I was hoping to gain more than $4500. However, Bob's message suggests that he's open to a fair split, and this offer is indeed equal.

I'll decide to...
