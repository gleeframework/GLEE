"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less. Considering the offer is now 50/50, I'll accept to avoid further negotiations and potential future losses due to inflation. 

```
