"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate later if you want. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

 While it's tempting to accept something, even a small amount, it's better to see if I can get a better deal. There are 12 rounds, and the money is worth less with each passing one. I'll try to negotiate a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering we both have an equal chance of getting a better deal in the future rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering we both have an equal chance of getting a better deal in the future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It seems Alice has adopted my previous proposal, and the inflation is starting to kick in. It's better to take the 4500 now than risk losing more in future rounds."
