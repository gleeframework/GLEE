45.0,55.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and we avoid the money losing value further.",Bob,2,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm still confident we can reach a better agreement.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the money is decreasing with each passing round.",Bob,4,
