"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60% for me!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still getting the larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fair compromise. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 20% less, the actual value of the offer is lower than it initially seems. Considering this, I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll take into account the inflation and try to make an offer that seems reasonable, considering the decreased value of the money. I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share than before, hoping that he'll accept it.\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal!""}"
