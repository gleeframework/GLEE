"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can adjust the split in later rounds if you like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair in the first round, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Accepting this offer would leave me with a significantly smaller share in the long run due to the decreasing value of money with each passing round.  Rejecting this offer allows me the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we can both benefit from the remaining rounds without the risk of losing value due to inflation.""}
