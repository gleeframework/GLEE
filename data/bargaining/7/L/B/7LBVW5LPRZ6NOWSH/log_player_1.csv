"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

This is my proposal for the initial division of the $1,000,000. Let me know what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 400,000 x 0.95 = 380,000
Bob gain: 600,000 x 0.95 = 570,000

I'll reject this offer since it's still not in my favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the risks and efforts involved""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 5% reduction in value due to inflation."
