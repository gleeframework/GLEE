Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a tough start, Alice! I'm proposing a more even split. This round is your best shot to secure a good amount, as the value decreases rapidly for you. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
