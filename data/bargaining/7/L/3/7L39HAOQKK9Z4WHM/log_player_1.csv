I'm going to try to get a good chunk of the money for myself, but I'm not sure how Bob will react.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Even though my gain is worth 5% less, I'm still getting $2,000. 
* **Bob's Loss:**  Bob's gain is worth 20% less, which means he's incentivized to accept this deal rather than risk getting less in future rounds. 
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject, I'll have to propose in the next round, and I'll face the same 5% inflation. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal.

It's better to secure $2,000 now than risk getting less in the future."
