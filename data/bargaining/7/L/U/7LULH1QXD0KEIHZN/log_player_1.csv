I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money in the first round, as the inflation will eat away at it quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $1,000,  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. I know the inflation is hurting me more than it's hurting Bob, so I'm going to try to hold out for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a more even split this time, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. I'm still mindful of the inflation, but I think a compromise is in order."
