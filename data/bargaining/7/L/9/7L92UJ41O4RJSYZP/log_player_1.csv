"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000. This is a fair starting point that leaves room for negotiation later.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I am going to reject it.  I believe I can get a better deal with a little more negotiation.  It's important to remember that the money will continue to devalue with each passing round.  Let's see what I can offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $800,000 for myself and $200,000 for Bob.  This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping to reach a compromise before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a significant improvement from his last offer, I still believe I can get a better deal. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to secure a larger share before it's too late. I'm going to try to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself.  We're getting close to the danger zone, and I'm making one last attempt to secure a decent portion of the money before the inflation really hits hard."
