"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Take this and we can end it here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I don't know the inflation effect on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of its value in the previous round.

In the previous round, the offer was $600,000 for me and $400,000 for Bob. Now, Bob is offering me $300,000, which is 50% of the previous offer, and $700,000 for himself, which is 175% of the previous offer.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I'll try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll aim to get a bit more than my previous offer, considering the inflation effect.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, Bob. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

This offer gives me 42% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Still a bit short, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation effect.

In the first round, my gain was $600,000. After 3 rounds of inflation, my gain is worth 0.7329 (1 - 0.2671) times $600,000, which is approximately $439,740.

In the first round, Bob's gain was $400,000. After 3 rounds of inflation, Bob's gain is worth 0.5162 (1 - 0.4838) times $400,000, which is approximately $206,480.

Now, let's compare Bob's offer in Round 4: $400,000 for me and $600,000 for him. In terms of the original values, this is equivalent to $439,740 for me and $206,480 for him.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a good deal for me, as it's closer to the original value of my gain in Round 1. I'll accept this offer.
