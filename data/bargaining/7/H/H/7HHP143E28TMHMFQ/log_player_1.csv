"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer and decide whether to accept or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 40-60 split. I'll try to negotiate further to get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has not affected my gains yet, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that Bob's offer was 60-40. I'll try to get closer to a 50-50 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

This offer is a slight improvement from Bob's previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, I think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer, taking into account the increased inflation that has affected his gains.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the inflation has significantly reduced the value of Bob's gains, and I think I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Bob's gains are worth less due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to affect Bob's gains, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of his potential winnings.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting any younger""
}
```

This offer is a slight improvement from my previous one, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it, considering the inflation has already reduced the value of his potential gains."
