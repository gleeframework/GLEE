"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. We both get something and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next!  I'm not sure 45 is enough for me to accept in the first round.  I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and we don't need to worry about inflation eating into our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair split, but inflation hurts you more than me. Let's be strategic to maximize what we both get. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this split. It's still not fair for me, and I think I can get a better deal. I'll try to negotiate a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I know inflation is affecting us both, but I think we can still find a compromise.  Let's split the money more evenly. This way, we can both get more than the previous offer, and we can avoid the risk of further inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! This offer gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation, but it's much better than what we'll both get if we wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still not good enough for me.  I am willing to risk a bit more inflation to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  We need to come to an agreement quickly to avoid losing too much to inflation.  Let's split the money evenly and avoid any further risk.""}
