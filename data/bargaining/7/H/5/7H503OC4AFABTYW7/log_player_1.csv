"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small share while still giving me the majority of the money. I want to see if he's willing to accept this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal.  While I understand the inflation effect, I'm not willing to settle for such a large reduction in my share.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 70/30, but I'm still keeping a significant share. I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us, but I'm not willing to give up much more ground."
