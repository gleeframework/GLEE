"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take this dollar, Bob. It's all yours! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept a measly dollar! Let's see what Alice has to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""This is a fair deal for both of us.  I get the majority, but you still get a significant amount.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. This way, we both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about further inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it! Inflation is a real concern, and while I'd prefer a bigger share, a 50/50 split is a good compromise and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
