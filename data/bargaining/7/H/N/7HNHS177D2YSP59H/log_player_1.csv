"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm proposing that Bob gets 40% of the total amount. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive than mine, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer, since I'd rather not give up 60% of the total amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the total amount is now $9,000. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent share. Let's see if he accepts!"
