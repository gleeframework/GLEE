"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I want to get as much as possible on the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less for me with every passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I proposed in the first round. I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still hoping to secure a significant portion of the money, but I'm willing to lower my asking price a bit to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. I'll propose an 80/20 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still lower than what I proposed in round 3, and the inflation is starting to really hurt. However, I'm hoping Bob will make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my asking price again, but I'm still trying to get a majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob is starting to realize that he needs to be more generous to avoid losing everything in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the closest offer Bob has made to my initial proposals, and the inflation is getting out of hand. I need to accept this offer to avoid losing a significant amount of money due to inflation."
