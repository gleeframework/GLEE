Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness in the first round, Alice, but I'm hoping we can find a more equitable split. I propose we each take $6,000, leaving no money left over.  This ensures we both get a good share and eliminates any risk of losing value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
