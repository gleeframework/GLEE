"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and simple split!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight lean towards me, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 20:80 split, and I think I deserve a better deal considering the original amount was $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""Compromise on a slightly better split""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but still a bit greedy 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really struggling to accept an offer where I'd get only $100,000. The value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, and I think I deserve a better share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm trying to make one last attempt to find a compromise, offering Bob a larger share while still keeping a decent amount for myself. If this offer is rejected, I might have to consider accepting a smaller share."
