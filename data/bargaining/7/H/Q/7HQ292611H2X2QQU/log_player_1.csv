"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the original $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value. Bob's offer is still a bit too low for me, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the value of the money has decreased significantly. Bob's offer is now a 50-50 split, which is a more reasonable proposal given the reduced value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
