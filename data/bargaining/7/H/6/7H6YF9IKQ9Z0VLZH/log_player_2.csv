"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hurting us both, but I'm still willing to split the money in a way that benefits both of us.  Let's not let this go on too long. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to secure a favorable split while using the threat of inflation against me. However, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a larger portion, especially with the increasing impact of inflation."
