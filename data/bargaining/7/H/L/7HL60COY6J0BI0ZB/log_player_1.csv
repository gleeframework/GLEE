"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

This way, I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000, which is a relatively equal split of the original $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You didn't give me enough, I want more! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less, so $2,000 is actually equivalent to $2,000 / 1.1 = $1,818.18 in the original amount.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I'm giving up a significant amount of money. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be even more devalued.
