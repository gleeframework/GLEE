"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob receives 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more balanced starting point. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. After all, it's still a decent offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to improve the split in future rounds.
