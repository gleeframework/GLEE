"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me as Bob.  It makes more sense to wait for a larger share, or even propose a more advantageous split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand you want to be fair, but the inflation makes this tricky. How about this split?""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning the Tables:** This offer reverses Alice's proposal, aiming to see if she recognizes the advantage Bob holds with the lower inflation rate.
* **Early Negotiation:**  It's still early in the game. Offering a 60/40 split gives room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it.  
* **Clear Communication:** The message acknowledges Alice's fairness point while highlighting the impact of inflation on their decision-making."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly moving towards a more reasonable split, acknowledging the impact of inflation. However, it's still early in the game. The decreasing value of the money for Alice puts more pressure on her to make a deal soon. Holding out a little longer might lead to an even better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, and every round makes the deal less sweet for both of us. I'm proposing a 65/35 split.  Let's close this out.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:**  With each round, the decreasing value of the money incentivizes a deal. Bob is pushing his advantage slightly but leaving room for Alice to accept before the shrinking pot makes it less appealing for her.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message directly emphasizes the time constraint, reminding Alice that delaying is mutually disadvantageous.
* **Leaving Negotiation Space:**  While a 65/35 split might seem like a strong position, it leaves room for a counter-offer from Alice, potentially in the 60/40 range, which would still be a favorable outcome for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last fair offer 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point of the rounds. The value of the money is rapidly decreasing, especially for Alice.
* **Shifting Dynamics:** Alice's offer of a 50/50 split, while framed as ""fair,"" indicates a significant shift in her negotiating position.  She's clearly feeling the pressure of the diminishing returns.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a better deal carries the risk of Alice offering even less in subsequent rounds or reaching a point where she's better off letting the deal fail entirely. Accepting a 50/50 split guarantees Bob a reasonable share at this stage."
