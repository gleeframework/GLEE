"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a relatively fair offer, considering the inflation rates. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the inflation makes this tricky. How about this split? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Accepting 40% of the money, which is now worth less due to inflation, seems like a bad idea. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the initial round, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor, which is closer to Bob's proposed split. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to convey my willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, and every round makes the deal less sweet for both of us. I'm proposing a 65/35 split.  Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth significantly less for me now due to inflation, accepting 35% of the money seems unfair. Bob's message tries to create a sense of urgency, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to make another counteroffer in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Last fair offer""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a final attempt at a fair offer. Considering the significant decrease in value for me (48.8% less than the initial round) and the moderate decrease for Bob (14.26% less), I'm willing to propose an equal split. This offer is as fair as it gets, given the circumstances. The message ""Last fair offer"" conveys that I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't accept this proposal, as further negotiations might lead to an unfair deal for me.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds."
