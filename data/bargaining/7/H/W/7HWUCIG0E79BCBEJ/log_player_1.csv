"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 50/50.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'll see if Bob accepts or rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take a little more since we are losing value each round.  Let's split it 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of my gain decreasing by 5% due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd like to get a larger share of the money before the value decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the value of my gain is decreasing by 5% each round, I'll aim for a higher share now. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but I think 60/40 is a fair split now.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to 70/30, but I'm not going to give up more than that.  We're both losing value on this money and I think we can find a fair split here. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of my gain decreasing by 14.26% now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk losing even more value in future rounds. 70/30 seems like a reasonable split at this point."
