"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me.

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the reduced value of money, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than the initial $1,000,000, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now.

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll have to be even more cautious. However, this offer is slightly better than my previous one, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

I'll accept this offer.
