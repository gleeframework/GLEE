"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than 50/50. Let's see what happens in the next round!\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Alice proposes next.\n###\n\n(By the way, nice touch with the inflation mechanic. That adds an interesting twist to the game!)"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I'll try to take advantage of that.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""You're losing value each round, let's be realistic""}\n\n###\n\nLet me know how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't accept such a drastic shift in the split. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI think I can still squeeze a bit more out of this deal. Since the money is worth less and less to Alice each round, I'm willing to take the risk and see what happens next.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","With each passing round, the pressure on Alice increases. I'll try to take advantage of that.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is dropping. Be realistic, Alice!""}\n\n###\n\nLet me know how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm still hoping for a more balanced split.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I think I've pushed Alice far enough. The current offer is quite favorable to me, and considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money to Alice, I don't want to risk her walking away with nothing (which would mean I get nothing too).\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm happy with the 60/40 split. Let's finalize the deal!"
