"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. I'm proposing a 45/55 split.  It's a decent compromise considering the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
