"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal, let's split it 90/10. It's better for both of us than going to the next round, as inflation will start to eat away at our money. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
