"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. Given the rules of the game, where each round decreases the value of the money, it's strategic to try to end the game as early as possible to maximize the real value of the money received. My message, ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more,"" acknowledges that I'm taking a slightly larger share but frames it as a gesture of fairness, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and potentially ending the game quickly. This approach balances the strategic need to maximize my gain with the psychological aspect of negotiation, where perceived fairness can be a powerful motivator for agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it more evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, accepting 45 dollars in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a similar amount in the first round due to the 20% decrease in value for me. Additionally, given that Bob's decrease in value is only 5%, I believe there's room for further negotiation that could result in a more favorable division for me. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose a new division in the next round that might better reflect the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to take into account the effects of inflation and Bob's previous offer. By proposing that I take $52 and Bob takes $48, I'm moving closer to an even split but still aiming to maximize my gain given the decreasing value of the money. My message, ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle,"" acknowledges the impact of inflation on our negotiations and frames my offer as a compromise, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the mutual interest in reaching an agreement before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of an even split. Given the significant decrease in the value of the money for me (48.8% less than in the first round) and the ongoing impact of inflation, accepting this offer ensures that I receive a known quantity now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Bob's message, suggesting we split it evenly to avoid further losses, aligns with my own strategic interest in maximizing the real value of the money I receive. Accepting this offer ends the game on a mutually agreeable note and secures a gain that, while not optimal, is reasonable under the circumstances."
