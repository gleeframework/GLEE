"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 25% and keep 75%. Your turn!""
}
```

This way, I get 75% of the original $1,000,000, which is $750,000, and Bob gets 25%, which is $250,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and keep 60%, let's take it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $400,000
* Bob gain: $600,000

I'm not happy with this offer. I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.
