Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is fair and leaves us both with a considerable sum. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""It seems we both want a good deal, Alice. This offer is a compromise, meeting closer to the middle.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it.  We both lose if this goes on much longer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, consider these points:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point. The longer the game goes, the less money is available. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Each round makes the difference between offers less significant due to the inflation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks getting a worse deal or even nothing in the later rounds. 

This offer is close enough to my previous offer that accepting ensures a reasonable payout, even with the inflation."
