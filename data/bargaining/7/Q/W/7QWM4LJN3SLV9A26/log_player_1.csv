"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering to give Bob 20% of the money, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'm willing to accept a smaller share. However, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll offer a slightly smaller share to Bob. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! The money is worth less and less with each round. I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Since I'm not getting a significantly better deal, I'll accept this offer.
