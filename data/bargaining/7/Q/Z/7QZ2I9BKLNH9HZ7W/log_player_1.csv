"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you 20 dollars to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100 dollars, which is a relatively fair share, and I'm leaving 20 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 70 dollars is now worth less than before. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 65% of the 100 dollars, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but still leaving a significant amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 60 dollars is now worth even less. I'll consider Bob's offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll accept this offer. 60 dollars is still a decent amount, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal from Bob."
