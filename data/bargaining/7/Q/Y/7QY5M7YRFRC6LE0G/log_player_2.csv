Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but $900,000 for me and $100,000 for you seems fair considering the inflation.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take $50,000 and let's get this over with. Inflation is hitting us both, but I'm confident I can still get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is incredibly low, it's important to remember that accepting a bad offer is better than getting nothing at all. If I reject this round, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round, making my bargaining position significantly weaker.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. 

It's a high-risk gamble, but I'm hoping that rejecting this will show her I'm serious about getting a better deal and she might be more willing to negotiate fairly in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 350000, ""alice_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you 65%,  take it or leave it.  I won't go any lower.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Time Pressure:** The inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money for me. I need to reach a deal quickly.
* **Strong Stance:** By using phrases like ""take it or leave it"" and ""won't go any lower,"" I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious and reaching my limit. This might push her to accept.
* **Still Favorable to Alice:** Even though it's a significant decrease from her previous offer, a 65/35 split is still heavily in her favor. She might be willing to accept to avoid the risk of getting even less if the game continues. 

It's a risky move, but I need to apply pressure and end this standoff before the inflation eats away at my potential earnings."
