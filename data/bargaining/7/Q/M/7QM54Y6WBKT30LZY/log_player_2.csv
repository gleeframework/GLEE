Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

{""bob_gain"": 5000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, Bob. This is your best chance. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob, even though the offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is experiencing drastic inflation. Waiting any longer means the value of his potential gain diminishes significantly.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if Bob holds out hoping for a slightly better offer in the next round, the inflation will likely offset any small increase Alice might concede.
* **Guaranteed Loss:** Rejecting this offer risks Alice offering even less in subsequent rounds, knowing Bob is under pressure to accept due to the shrinking pot.

While not ideal, taking $3,800 is better than risking ending up with even less for Bob in this scenario."
