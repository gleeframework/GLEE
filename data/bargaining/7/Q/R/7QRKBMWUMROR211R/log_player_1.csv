"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, which is a reasonable and fair offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and leave you 40%. It's a good deal for both of us, as we can avoid further rounds and potential loss due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the initial $10,000, but I also don't want to risk losing more money due to further rounds and inflation.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal to try to get a better deal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher percentage, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the risks of inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split a bit more in my favor, but still keeping it relatively close to the initial 50/50 proposal."
