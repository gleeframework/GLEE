"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my offer. I believe it is a fair offer, as I am taking a larger share of the money, but I am still offering Bob a decent amount. I believe this will encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game, preventing any further potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation makes it increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer ensures a decent amount for me, even with the inflation factor. It's better to secure a gain than risk getting nothing in the end."
