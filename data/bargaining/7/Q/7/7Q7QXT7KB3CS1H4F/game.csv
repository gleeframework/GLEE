7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point considering the inflation rate is higher for you than for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Considering the inflation rates and the previous offers, I propose a new 52.5/47.5 split. This aims to balance fairness while taking into account the diminishing value of your money more significantly due to the higher inflation rate.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a more reasonable split considering the inflation rates and the previous offers. I'm trying to find a middle ground.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
