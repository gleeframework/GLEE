Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small portion, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  It's a high risk, but I'm banking on his potential greed being outweighed by the desire to avoid further rounds and inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's a significant drop from the first round, accepting is still better than rejecting. The next round would mean I get only 80% of what I'm getting now, and there's no guarantee Bob would offer me anything at all."
