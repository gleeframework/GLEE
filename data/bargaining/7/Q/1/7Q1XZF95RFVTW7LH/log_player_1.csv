"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

My gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56
Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm hoping this is a more attractive offer for Bob, and he'll accept and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share than the even split, but I need more than what you offered in the last round. This is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

My gain: 4000 / 0.271 = 1476.83
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.482 = 1243.85

I think this is a better deal for me than my previous offer, and it's still a relatively fair compromise. I'll accept this offer.
