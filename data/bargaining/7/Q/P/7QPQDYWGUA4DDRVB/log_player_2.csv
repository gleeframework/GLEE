"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair-ish split. I'm willing to give you 10% of the money, but I'm also keeping a close eye on inflation. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While a 10% share is better than nothing, the inflation rate means this deal will become worse in the next round. It's better to see if Alice will offer more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 60/40 in my favor. This accounts for the inflation rate and allows us both to get a decent share of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This split is fair considering the inflation, and ensures we both get a good amount. Let's finish this before the money loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is much better than what I offered in the previous round, considering the inflation. It's a good compromise and ensures I get a significant share of the money before it loses more value."
