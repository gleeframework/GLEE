"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split roughly down the middle, slightly favoring me since I'm making the first offer.  This ensures we both get a decent amount before inflation eats into it. 
# Bob gain: 4875 
# Alice gain: 5125 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer that might be more to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it exactly down the middle to be fair, considering inflation will affect us both equally.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making this offer to see if Alice values fairness and is willing to accept an equal split, which seems reasonable given the inflation factor."
