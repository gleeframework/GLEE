"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, let's try to meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my $6,000 from the first round is now worth less, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```"
