"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm trying to get a good chunk of the money upfront to account for the potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is less generous than mine in the first round, I'll reject it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to be more aggressive this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed in my favor, but I'm still leaving Bob with a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate being quite high, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now. Considering the value of the money has decreased significantly for him, I'll accept this offer.
