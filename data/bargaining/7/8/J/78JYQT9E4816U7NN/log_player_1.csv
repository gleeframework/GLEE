"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""

Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is not 50/50, I'll have to consider the value of the money. With inflation, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than my original 50/50 offer, but his gain is still larger than mine.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to see if I can do better.
