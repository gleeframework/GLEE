"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This is a pretty good deal for both of us, considering we have 11 more rounds to go and the money will be worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is a fair one, and it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the money.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
