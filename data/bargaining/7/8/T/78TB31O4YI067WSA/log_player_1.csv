"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, let's get closer to a deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the current value. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $3,000, which is 30% of the current total value of $10,000.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 30% of the total value. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's get closer to a deal!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob a larger share of the pie. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."

# Bob's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal, don't give up yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000

Considering the effects of inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer in terms of the current value. If I accept his offer, I'll get $4,000, which is 40% of the current total value of $10,000.

I'll think carefully about this one...
