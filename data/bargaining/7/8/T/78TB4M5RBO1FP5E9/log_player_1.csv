"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, a straightforward and fair division of the $10,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you'll follow 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less for me, but Bob's gain is even more affected.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 3:7 split. I'd like to propose my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still hoping to get a better deal than the 3:7 split he proposed earlier."
