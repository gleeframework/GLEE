"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 90% of the money, and you'll get 10%. It's a fair start!""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering our different inflation rates.  Let's work together to find a good solution! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less now, I'd rather aim for a higher share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a better deal, considering the inflation. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80% = 64%), I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70% of the remaining value, and you'll get 30%. Let's make a deal!""
}
