"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this started! I'll take 90% of the money, and you'll get 10%. It's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering our different inflation rates.  Let's work together to find a good solution!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 70% of the remaining value, and you'll get 30%. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, it's better to secure a decent amount than risk getting nothing in the next round with Alice's inflation advantage."
