"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering to split the money evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of the money. However, I'm not thrilled about the unequal split, and I was hoping to get a better deal.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, taking a bit more for myself while still leaving Bob with a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share!

Considering the value of the money has decreased for Bob, I'm willing to be more generous to make up for it. However, I'm still not thrilled about the relatively small difference between our gains.

After some thought, I've decided to accept this offer.
