"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting with a fair, but generous, offer. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I want to see what Alice's other offers are and how the inflation impacts them.  I can potentially get more if I reject and counter-propose."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 9000,
""alice_gain"": 1000,
""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I'm offering you a fair chance to accept, or we can continue to see how the inflation affects our choices.  ""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good share. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still very lopsided, and while inflation is a factor, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get more than $2000 if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We've both lost a significant amount of value due to inflation, so it's in our best interest to settle now.""
