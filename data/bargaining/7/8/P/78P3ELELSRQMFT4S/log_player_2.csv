It's better to reject and see what Alice will offer in the next round. It is in Alice's best interest to try and get you to accept something, as the money will be worth less to you every round."

Alice is still offering a very uneven split. Since the money is losing value for me every round, it's worth holding out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm willing to budge a little from the 50/50 split, but still want to get a decent share."

Alice's offer is getting worse, but I need to be careful. I'm losing a lot of value each round, but if I reject, I might end up with nothing. I'll see what she offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I need to start getting more aggressive. The inflation is hurting me, but I still need to secure a reasonable share."

While this isn't ideal, the inflation is really starting to bite. I need to secure something before the value drops even further."
