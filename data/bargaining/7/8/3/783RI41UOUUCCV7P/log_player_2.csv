Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching down slowly, but we're still losing significant money to inflation. By consistently rejecting offers where Alice gets significantly more, I'm hoping to signal that I'm willing to risk it all for a more even split.  Time pressure is working in my favor now."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Time is running out. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value decreases significantly. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
* **Slight Advantage:** Offering slightly more than half shows a willingness to compromise but still aims for a favorable outcome. 
* **Strong Message:**  The message emphasizes the time sensitivity and positions the offer as generous in light of the dwindling pot."
