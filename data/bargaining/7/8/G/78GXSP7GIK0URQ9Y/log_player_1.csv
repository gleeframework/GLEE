"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly better offer, but still a bit unfair for me 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit unfair, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more balanced. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50 this time!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise."
