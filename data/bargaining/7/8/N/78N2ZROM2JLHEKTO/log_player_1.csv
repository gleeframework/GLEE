"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal quickly to avoid inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 45% of the money, which is slightly less than half, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping that the message will persuade Bob to accept the offer and close the deal quickly, so we can both avoid losing money due to inflation. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the need to act fast, but fairness is key. Let's ensure a more balanced outcome. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 5% less, the actual value of the offer is 0.95 * $475,000 = $451,250 for me and 0.95 * $525,000 = $498,750 for Bob. Considering this, I still think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject the offer.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 10% less than the original amount (5% less in each of the first two rounds), I'll have to take that into account when making my new offer. I'll propose a division that gives me a bit more than last time, considering the decreasing value of the money.
{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Let's not forget, time is money! The longer we wait, the less we'll get.""}\n\nI'm hoping that Bob will be more willing to accept this offer, given the decreasing value of the money and the fact that I've given him a slightly larger share than last time. Fingers crossed!"
