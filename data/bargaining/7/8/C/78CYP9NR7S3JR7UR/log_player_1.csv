"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to negotiate a better deal for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a little more this time, but it's still a fair deal. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a fair deal for me. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll take that into account when making my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking more, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground. Your turn, Bob!"
