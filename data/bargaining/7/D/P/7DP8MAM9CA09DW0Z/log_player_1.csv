"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for further negotiation""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight majority, but I think it's fair considering the game's dynamic 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to give me a slight majority, huh? I'll think about it...

I'll accept his offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation!"
