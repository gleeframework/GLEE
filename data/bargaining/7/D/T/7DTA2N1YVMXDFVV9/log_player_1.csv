"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount. I'm hoping this is attractive enough to avoid going to the next round where the money will be worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than what Bob offered in the first round, I'm still getting significantly less than I proposed in the first round. I'm confident that I can do better than this, and I want to see if I can negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm offering a smaller amount to Bob than my previous offer, but it's still a substantial sum. Given the inflation, I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. If he rejects this offer, I'm confident that I can still secure a good deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is significantly worse than my previous offer, and the inflation has made it even less appealing.  I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I believe this is still a fair deal considering the inflation. I am aware that the money is worth less for both of us with each round, but I still want to secure a good portion of the money. If he rejects this, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round, even if it's worth less for both of us."
