"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiation""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be more fair, how about 60/40 in my favor this time? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more cautious now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit steep, I was hoping for a more balanced split""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and looking for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 5% less now due to inflation, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45-55 is a fairer split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but still aiming for a slightly higher share for myself."
