"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split close to 50/50, but I get slightly more since I proposed first. This way we both benefit from ending the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money loses 5% of its value each round, I'm willing to take that risk in hopes of getting a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal. I'll suggest a division and explain my reasoning in a few words."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that still tries to be somewhat fair but tips the balance slightly more in my favor, considering the devaluation of money with each round.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think we should adjust the split to favor me slightly more since I'm taking the risk of further devaluation.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of the money by 9.75% from the first round, accepting a 50/50 split at this point seems like the most reasonable decision. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money more, likely resulting in a worse outcome for both of us. Ending the game here ensures we both get an equal share without suffering from additional devaluation."
