"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that I'm making the offer this time. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll be gaining 32 (40 * 0.8) and Bob will be gaining 48 (60 * 0.8).

I don't think this offer is more fair than my previous one, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less in the third round, I'll be gaining 25.6 (32 * 0.8) and Bob will be gaining 74.4 (48 * 0.8).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, Bob, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
