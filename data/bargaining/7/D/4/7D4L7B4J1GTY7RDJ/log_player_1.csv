I'm going for a slightly aggressive opening, trying to secure a large share. It's a risky strategy, but with the inflation factor, I want to maximize my gains quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy right now.  The inflation means my gains are shrinking with each round, and Bob's offer, while not ideal, is a decent amount.  It's better to secure something now rather than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
