# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more this time, Bob.  But I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not convinced.  Alice needs to offer me a more substantial share if we're going to reach an agreement."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. Let's find a compromise that's better than both of us getting nothing. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I need to see a bigger increase on my side.""}
```"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need a significant share.  Let's make a deal before things get even worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with the distribution. Alice needs to give me more, or I'll be left with a tiny fraction of the original value.  Let's see if we can get closer to a more even split in the next round."
