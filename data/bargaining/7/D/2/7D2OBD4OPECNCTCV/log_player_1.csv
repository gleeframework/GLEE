"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, no need to negotiate further!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $500,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a small risk, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. You can't have it all!""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, where I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. I'm trying to make a slightly more favorable offer to Bob, but still keeping a significant portion of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is still quite lopsided! I'm not thrilled about giving up most of the money, but I'm willing to consider it. Since I've already rejected a few offers, I'm not sure I can do much better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since Bob's been pushing for a bigger share, I'll try to squeeze him a bit harder.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm not budging much more!""}

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, where I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. I'm trying to make it clear that I'm not willing to give up much more, and Bob will have to decide whether to accept this offer or keep pushing for a better deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to let you walk all over me, I'm taking more than half. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting bold! I'm not thrilled about giving up 40% of the money, but I'm starting to realize that I might not be able to get a better deal. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer or keep negotiating.
