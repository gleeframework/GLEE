"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me the majority of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to adjust my expectations. With the offer from Bob, I would get $50, which is worth 95% of the original $50, or $47.50. This is a good deal, so I accept.
