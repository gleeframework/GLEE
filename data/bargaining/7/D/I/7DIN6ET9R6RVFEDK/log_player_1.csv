"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This way, we can both get a fair share and avoid any potential conflict."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still want to keep a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up $1,000 more than I did in the first round, so I'll reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a slight edge""
}
```

I'm increasing my initial offer from Round 1 by $500, giving me a slightly higher share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This offer is closer to my original proposal from Round 1, and I'm willing to accept it. I'm getting a slightly higher share than in Round 1, and it seems like a reasonable compromise."
