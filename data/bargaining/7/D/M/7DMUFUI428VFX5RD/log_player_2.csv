Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation's biting, but I'm still not ready to give up that much. Meet me at 57-43? 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, but she's still offering me less than what I proposed in round 4. While the difference seems small, waiting her out could lead to a better deal in the next few rounds.  I need to hold my ground a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the deal is getting worse for you every round. I'm willing to be generous, but this is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is on Alice. She's losing value with each passing round.
* **Conveying finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to push Alice towards accepting.
* **Slight concession:** While I'm still aiming for a better deal than her 57-43 offer, I'm willing to concede a little to encourage her to accept."
