Alice is slowly moving closer to a more even split, but the rate is too slow. I need to show firmness, otherwise, she'll continue to take advantage of the time pressure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement in your offers, but we need to close this gap now. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the most reasonable deal you'll get at this point. Take it before the money shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I need to start being realistic. Alice is very slowly moving towards a more even split, but at this rate, the inflation will eat up most of the gains anyway. Accepting a slightly worse deal now is better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
