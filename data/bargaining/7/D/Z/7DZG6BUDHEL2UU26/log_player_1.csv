"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate more in the next round 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm hoping to get a better deal, especially considering that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gain is worth 20% less. I'm expecting a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a more favorable offer for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a 60-40 split in my favor, but with a slightly lower value for myself due to the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""You're being generous, but I'm hoping for a better deal for myself this time.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still holding out for a better deal for myself 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation that has occurred, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll try to take advantage of this by accepting a slightly lower share for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the current inflation rate."
