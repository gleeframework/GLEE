I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, leaving Bob with only $1. This is a risky strategy, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept such a small amount."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, remember that the inflation is working against me.  I need to secure a better deal for myself, especially since I'm losing value with every round. I'll try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
