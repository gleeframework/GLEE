"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm making a strong offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice's gain: $4000 / 0.8 = $5000
Bob's gain: $6000 / 0.8 = $7500

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away the whole pie!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, hoping to get a better deal than the previous offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm making the best offer you'll get! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Let's calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice's gain: $3000 / 0.5208 (1 - 0.478) = $5769
Bob's gain: $7000 / 0.5208 = $13447.45 (but I don't know the inflation rate for Bob, so I'll just consider the nominal value)

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2800,
  ""bob_gain"": 7200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm still not giving up!""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly better deal to try to close the deal."
