"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of the money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share now, avoid a worse deal later 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. He's trying to get a larger share of the money, and I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives me only $4,000. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Compromise and take a smaller share now""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground and make a compromise, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
