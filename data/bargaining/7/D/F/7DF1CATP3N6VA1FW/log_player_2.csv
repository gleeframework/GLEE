Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer is very generous, but I think we can find a more balanced agreement. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? It reflects the greater impact of inflation on your share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer considering the higher impact of inflation on my share. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the faster inflation on her end. While her offer is closer to a reasonable split, accepting now would still give her a significantly larger share of the original value. I need to push for a better deal while keeping the dwindling value of the money in mind."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000,
