"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can both go home!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a bit more this time, but I'm still willing to split the money fairly. Accept and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting, and my gain is worth 5% less this round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving him 51% of the remaining money. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 5% toll on my potential gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. This is a fair deal for both of us, considering the inflation. Let's finish this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! I'm not thrilled about giving Bob 55% of the remaining money, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out.

Considering the inflation and the fact that I'm getting closer to the deadline, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not convinced that this is the best deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode my potential gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's time to split it down the middle. No more negotiating, let's just divide it evenly.""
}
```

I'm not leaving any room for negotiation, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair and equal split."
