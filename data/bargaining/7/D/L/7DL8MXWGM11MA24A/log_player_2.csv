"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we take a larger share now, as the value decreases quickly. This offer leaves you with a decent sum. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share than you proposed, but I believe this is a fair split considering the inflation rate.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. Your offer last round was heavily skewed in your favor considering the rapid devaluation. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is more realistic considering the inflation rate. Accepting this offer secures me a decent amount, and further rounds may risk losing everything."
