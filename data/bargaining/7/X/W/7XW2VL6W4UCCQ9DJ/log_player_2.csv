{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too one-sided. Let's be reasonable, how about a 55/45 split in my favor?  This accounts for the inflation affecting you more.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting me harder, but your offer was still tilted in your favor. How about we meet in the middle at a 55/45 split for me this time? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
