"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, reflecting our equal contributions. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to me due to inflation. I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially when I think our contributions are more equal. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a better split. You can't have all the fun!""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, taking into account the inflation effect on my side. I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which I think is a fair compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
