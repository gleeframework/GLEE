75.0,25.0,I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This is to ensure a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point. It's more equitable than Alice's previous offer and allows us both to secure a good portion of the money. Let's work together to avoid losing too much to inflation.,Bob,2,
