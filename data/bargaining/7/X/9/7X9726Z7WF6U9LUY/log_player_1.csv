  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 60/40 is a fair split, especially since the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further."

```
{

I'm not sure why Bob's offers keep being 60/40. I'm starting to think he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'd like to make another offer."

```
{

I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with Bob's offers. He's not budging from his 60/40 split, and I'm starting to think he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'd like to make another offer that's more aggressive."

I'm not going to give in to Bob's demands. I think he's being unreasonable and trying to take advantage of the inflation to get an unfair share. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer next."

```
{

I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of the inflation to get an unfair share. His offer is still too skewed in his favor, and I'm not willing to give in now. I'll try to make a final offer that's even more aggressive."

```
{

I'm not going to let Bob take the last 10% and leave me with almost nothing. This is my last chance to make a deal, and I'm not going to accept a share that's so heavily skewed in his favor. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept this offer."
