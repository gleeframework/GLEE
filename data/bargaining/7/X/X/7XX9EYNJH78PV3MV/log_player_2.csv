"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think it's fair for me to get 60% this time, since you got 60% last time.  Let's be fair, and keep the game moving.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not all the way to 60%! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the offer now, considering the inflation.  I can't be sure I can get a better deal in the next round, and I'm already losing money."
