Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a measly $1 to start.  He'll likely reject this, but it's a good way to see how greedy he is.  It also sets the stage for me to control the narrative and make bigger gains in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair deal.  Even though I'm losing 20% of the value of my share due to inflation, 500,000 is still a significant amount of money.  I don't want to risk losing it all by being too greedy and getting nothing."
