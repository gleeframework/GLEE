"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and offer Bob a decent share to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is now worth 20% less than it was in the first round, and Bob's share is still worth the same. This means I'm effectively losing more value with each passing round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, my money is worth 40% less than in the first round, due to two rounds of inflation. I'll aim for a more balanced split this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is worth significantly less than Bob's. I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since my money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer is still a 55-45 split, it seems like Bob is getting a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 5, my money is worth 61.2% less than in the first round, due to three rounds of inflation. I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This is a more aggressive offer, but I'm trying to account for the significant loss of value due to inflation."
