"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm only getting 20% of the total amount, which is a very small share. I think I deserve a better deal, especially considering the money is worth 5% less than it was in the first round. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you a majority, but I'm holding firm on my share""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, where I take 45 dollars and Bob takes 55 dollars. I'm willing to give Bob a majority, but I'm not willing to give up too much more than that. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the money is worth less than it was in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a big share, but I'll give you a tiny bit 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with Bob's offer. I'm only getting 10% of the total amount, which is an incredibly small share. The fact that the money is worth even less than it was in the first round makes it even more unacceptable. I think I deserve a much better deal, and I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to get a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""I'll give you a big chunk, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, where I take 30 dollars and Bob takes 70 dollars. I'm willing to give Bob a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up the majority of the money. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the money is worth less than it was in the first round."
