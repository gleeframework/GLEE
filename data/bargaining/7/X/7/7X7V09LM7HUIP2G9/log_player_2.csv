Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a better deal, but I'm also losing money with each round.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think it's fair. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing a significant chunk of money each round. My offer is more than generous considering the circumstances.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  We're both losing money, but I think we can find a solution that's more fair than your last offer.  Let's try this. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, Alice is finally showing some flexibility. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, whereas continuing to hold out risks getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. The difference in loss between this round and the next is significant enough to warrant accepting.
