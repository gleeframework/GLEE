"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a slightly bigger share, but we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's offer isn't fair enough for me, and I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's try to be more fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that gives me a slightly bigger share, but still leaves Alice with a significant amount. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to her, considering the inflation that will reduce the value of the money in subsequent rounds."
