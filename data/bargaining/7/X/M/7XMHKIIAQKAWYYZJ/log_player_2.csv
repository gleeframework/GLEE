"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the $10000 evenly. We both stand to gain equally from this fair division. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

An even split is the fairest and most logical option in the first round. It's unlikely Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds, and inflation will only hurt Bob's potential gains."
