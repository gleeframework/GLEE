**Explanation:**

Even though the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my earnings, this offer is the best I've seen. In the previous round, I offered 7000 for myself and Alice rejected it.  Now, Alice is offering 5000, which is better than nothing. 

It's important to note that continuing to reject offers might lead to a situation where I end up with nothing as the inflation continues."
