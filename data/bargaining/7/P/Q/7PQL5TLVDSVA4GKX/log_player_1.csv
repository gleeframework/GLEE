"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective gain I'd get from this offer. If I take this offer, I'd get 450,000, which is equivalent to 450,000 / (1 - 0.2) = 562,500 in the first round. That's not a bad deal, considering the reduced value of money.

On the other hand, Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so he's getting 550,000, which is equivalent to 550,000 / (1 - 0.1) = 607,143 in the first round. That's a pretty good deal for Bob!

Considering the reduced value of money and the fact that Bob's gain is still relatively higher, I'll decide to...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly better deal, hoping to persuade him to accept this time."
