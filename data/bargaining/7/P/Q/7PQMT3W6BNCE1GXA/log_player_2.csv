"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40.  It's a good offer for you to start with. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. How about a 55/45 split?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my previous offer, Bob.  $60 for me, $40 for you. Time is ticking and the value for you is going down! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take $55, you get $45.  This is a fair compromise considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $45 is better than risking getting nothing as the rounds progress and inflation eats into Bob's potential gains."
