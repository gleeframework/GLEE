"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this and we're done! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. With inflation, the money is worth less to me with each passing round, but it's worth even less to Alice. I'm hoping to get a more favorable offer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal that will surely be more reasonable than Alice's offer.\n\n###\n\nMy proposal for Round 2 will be:\n\n# Bob's message: Let's be fair and square! \n# Bob gain: 4000 \n# Alice gain: 6000 \n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know about my decision and proposal. I'm looking forward to her response."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI've made up my mind. Since the money is worth 20% less to me with each passing round, I need to make a proposal that will get me the most value out of this deal. Here's my offer:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and square!""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice and let me know her decision. I'm hoping she'll see the fairness in my proposal and accept it.\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to her response!"
