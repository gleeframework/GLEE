"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 80-20 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair, given the inflation factor we should both get something out of this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think Bob's offer is a good one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split, with me getting $5,000 and Bob getting $5,000. This seems like a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
