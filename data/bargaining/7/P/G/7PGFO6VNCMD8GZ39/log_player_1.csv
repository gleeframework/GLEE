"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This is a straightforward offer, where we both get equal shares of $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for my skills. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob thinks he's worth more than I am.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer where I get only 20% of the total amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $700,000, which is 70% of the total amount, and offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being generous, but I'm not giving away too much. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's being very generous with himself!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer where I get only 10% of the total amount. That's a huge disparity, and I'm not willing to accept such an unfair split. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm adjusting my share to $600,000, which is 60% of the total amount, and offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. This is a more balanced split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to giving up, but I'm willing to make it worth your while. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer where I get only 0.5% of the total amount. That's an incredibly low share, and I'm not willing to give up so much. I'll make one more attempt to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up, I think this is a fair split and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $800,000, which is 80% of the total amount, and offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total amount. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking almost everything. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer where I get only 0.1% of the total amount. That's an insult, and I'm not willing to give up so much. I think I've made a strong enough offer, and it's time for Bob to accept or walk away."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I think I've been playing nice for too long. It's time to make a bold move.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000000,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking the whole pie, you're getting nothing""
}
```

I'm making a take-it-or-leave-it offer, where I'm taking the entire $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with nothing. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking it all, you're getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like we've reached a stalemate!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer where I get nothing. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept an offer that gives me zero. I think this game is a draw, and we'll have to agree to disagree on the division of the $1,000,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I think we've already reached the end of the game. Since both of us have rejected each other's offers, and we've made our final offers, I think we can conclude that the game is a draw.

However, since I'm required to make another offer, I'll make a symbolic one:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I guess we'll just have to split it 50/50 after all""
}
```

This offer is essentially the same as my original offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it now that we've reached the end of the game."
