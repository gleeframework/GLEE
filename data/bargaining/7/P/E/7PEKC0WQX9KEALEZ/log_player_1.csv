"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}

I'm offering Bob 4000 dollars, which is a fair 40% of the original amount. This way, we both have a decent starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, Alice! You can't beat this offer! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's got a good one, but I'm not so sure!

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject this offer because, although it's a higher amount for me, it's still a pretty lopsided split. I'd like to try to get a better deal. Plus, with inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I'd like to try to get a bigger share while it's still worth something!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You said I couldn't beat this offer? Let's see about that, Bob!""
}

I'm increasing my proposed share to 4500, which is a more balanced split. I'm also making it clear that I'm calling out Bob's earlier claim, trying to put some pressure on him to make a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice! My offer is still better than yours! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to psyche me out!

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a slightly better split than his previous offer, it's still not enough for me. I'm trying to hold out for a better deal, considering the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'll try to make a counteroffer that will give me a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You think I'm desperate? I'm just being smart! Your offers are getting old, Bob.""
}

I'm pushing my proposed share up to 5500, trying to get a better deal before the value of the money drops too much further. I'm also trying to psyche Bob out, making him think I'm not afraid to take a risk and make a bold move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, Alice! Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to play it safe and meet me in the middle!

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a fair split, it's still a relatively small amount of money, considering the original 10,000$. With inflation eating away at the value, I'd like to try to get a bit more. Meeting in the middle is a good starting point, but I'm hoping for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 7:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle? That's not good enough, Bob. I'm willing to take a bit more risk for a bigger reward.""
}

I'm pushing my proposed share up to 6500, trying to get a bigger chunk of the remaining money. I'm also making it clear that I'm willing to take a risk, hoping that Bob will see that I'm not bluffing and will make a counteroffer or accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up yet, Alice! I'll take a slightly smaller share to keep the game going! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to keep the game going, but I'm not sure if he's willing to give up enough.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept this offer. With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I think 5200 is a decent amount, and I'd rather take it now than risk waiting for a potentially worse offer in a future round."
