Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go back to the original offer.  We both know I'm losing money with each round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough one! While I'd like to get more, Bob is right. He's incentivized to make a deal, and this is the same offer I originally proposed.  It's better to accept a decent offer now than risk getting nothing later."
