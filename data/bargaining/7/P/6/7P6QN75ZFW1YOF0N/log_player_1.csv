"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it seems like a fair and straightforward way to start the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you take 40, let's end it here 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, as it seems unfair to me. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, you can't do better than that""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive this time, offering Bob a slightly lower share, but still a decent compromise. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, 50/50, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to go back to the original proposal, but with a bit more emphasis on meeting in the middle.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept the 50/50 split, as it's a fair and reasonable compromise. It's better than going back and forth and risking further erosion of the value of the money due to inflation. Let's call it a day!"
