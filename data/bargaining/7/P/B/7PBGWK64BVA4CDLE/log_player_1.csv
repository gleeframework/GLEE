"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid going into further rounds, which would lead to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and reasonable offer 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll make a decision. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'd rather not accept a 50/50 split, as it would leave me with less than I would have gotten in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Consider this offer.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the 10% inflation, and I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal than the 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but you'll have to meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think it over. With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about getting 700,000. However, it's still a better deal than the 50/50 split from the previous round. I'll accept this offer to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of my potential earnings.
