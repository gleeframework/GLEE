"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $400,000, it's important to consider the game's dynamics. Alice is getting a significantly larger share and the money will depreciate more quickly for her than for me.  By rejecting, I have a chance to propose a more favorable division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
``` 

This offer gives me a larger share, reflecting the fact that Alice's money is depreciating faster.  It also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's not a perfect outcome, accepting this offer gives me a substantial gain. Considering the inflation, Alice's offer is actually better for me than my own proposal from the previous round. It's best to take the sure thing now, especially since the money will continue to depreciate further in the coming rounds."
