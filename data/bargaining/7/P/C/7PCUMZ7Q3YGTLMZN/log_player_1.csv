"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This way, I'll get $4,000 and Bob will get $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain is worth less, but I still need to consider the offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, my gain will be worth even less, so I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```"
