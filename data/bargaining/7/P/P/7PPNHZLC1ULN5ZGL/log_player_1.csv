"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to secure the majority of the money. If Bob rejects this, the next round he will be the one making the offer, and the value of the money will go down for him, giving me a better chance in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less for me now, I believe I can still get a better deal in the future rounds.  Since the value of the money is declining faster for Bob, he's under more pressure to accept an offer in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. The declining value of the money is putting pressure on him, and this offer might be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  The money is worth significantly less for me now, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal in the future rounds. Bob is feeling the pressure of the declining money value even more than I am, so I'm going to keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping a majority share.  The money is worth less for both of us, but Bob's losses are larger. This might be the tipping point for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. Even though the money is worth significantly less for me now, I am not going to give up a majority share yet. The declining value of the money puts more pressure on Bob, and I believe I can still get a better deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a 50/50 split.  While the money is worth significantly less for me now, Bob is feeling the pressure of the declining value. It's a fair offer, and I think this might be the time to settle, before the risk of getting nothing at all becomes too high."
