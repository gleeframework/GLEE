"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but I'm willing to split the difference next round if you accept. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it more fairly this time.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less each round, I'm taking that into consideration with my offer. I believe 60% for me and 40% for Alice is a more reasonable split, considering she initially offered me only 10%. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a good starting point for round 2.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's response.\n\n###"
