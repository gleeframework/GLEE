"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and straightforward proposal to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a larger share of the pie.

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount of money. Let's see if he accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a balance between his desire for a larger share and the need to keep the negotiations going.

I'll accept this offer. It's a relatively close split, and I'd rather take this deal than risk going into another round with an uncertain outcome.
