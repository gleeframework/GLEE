"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not so fast, Bob!

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle? That's not good enough! I'm still getting the short end of the stick.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that still leaves me with a smaller share than Bob. I'll try to do better next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced. Meet me here!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance that will make Bob accept, while still getting a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, I'll meet you halfway this time 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. Considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Halfway is not good enough, Bob. I need a better deal to make up for the lost value.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that still leaves me with a smaller share than Bob, especially with the value of the money decreasing rapidly due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. It's the fairest way to end this.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that will satisfy both of us, but I'm not giving up my negotiating power just yet."
