"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a larger share since the inflation hits you harder, Bob. Let's be reasonable and avoid losing money! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is ""reasonable"" in the sense that she acknowledges the different inflation rates, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference, Alice. I'm willing to give you a larger share to avoid further losses due to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is running out and we both lose with every round.  I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's seal the deal! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still skewed in her favor, but it's getting closer to a more equitable split, and with the clock ticking, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round.  Accepting minimizes our losses."
