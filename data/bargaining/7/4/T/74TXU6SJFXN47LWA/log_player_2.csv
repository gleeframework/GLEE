  ""alice_gain"": 100000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob.  However, I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity. Let's split the difference from your last offer. 900,000 for me, and 100,000 for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid further rounds of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000
