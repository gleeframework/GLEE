"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority (90%) of the money, leaving Bob with a smaller share. I'm hoping that he'll accept it in the first round, as the money will become worth less for me in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. While his offer seems generous on the surface, it's worth remembering that my share will be worth less in the next round due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is starting to bite, I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob's offer is essentially the same as mine from the previous round, only with the roles reversed. I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided division, and I'm hoping he'll recognize that I'm willing to hold out for a fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting increasingly frustrating! While Bob's offer is more generous than his previous one, it still leaves me with a significantly smaller share. I'm aware of the increasing inflation, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion of the money, especially since we're still relatively early in the game. I'll keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Despite the ever-increasing inflation, I'm still unwilling to accept such a disproportionate deal. Bob's offer is essentially the same as my previous one, but with the roles reversed.  I'm holding out hope that he'll realize the value of reaching a more equitable agreement before the inflation erodes our potential gains even further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

The inflation is starting to hurt a lot, but I'm still trying to secure a decent share of the money. This offer is a further compromise, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to come to a compromise before we both lose out completely."

This is getting desperate, but I still refuse to accept such a lopsided deal. I'm clinging to the hope that Bob will see the value in splitting the money more fairly before the inflation completely eats away at our potential gains."

Round 11
