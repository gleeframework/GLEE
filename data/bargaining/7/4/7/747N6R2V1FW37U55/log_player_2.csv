"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it 60-40. We both get a good amount, and we avoid losing value due to inflation.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. I'm willing to make a small concession. 58-42 is a more than fair split, given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my higher inflation rate, but her offer is barely budging.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a more equitable deal.  The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me, but it also puts pressure on her to make a real compromise."
