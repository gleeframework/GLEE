"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small cut, let's negotiate further! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, his offer is effectively taking a larger share of the total amount. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with that.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if we can find a more balanced split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to balance things out""}

I'm proposing a slightly more skewed split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Still a bit too generous for you, I think 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant decrease in value of the money Bob gains due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'm willing to compromise.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that we can still find a better split later on.
