Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is the best I can do.  We're running out of time! 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the time limit, but her offer is getting worse!  I need to hold firm and show I'm serious about getting a better deal.  The inflation is hurting me more, but we're getting to the point where it'll be seriously impacting her gains soon too."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm, but this is a compromise. Let's end this before inflation eats away even more.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:** I'm slightly increasing my offer to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm not budging much.  
* **Deadline Pressure:** I'm emphasizing the shrinking pot due to inflation, which impacts both of us, although it hurts me more.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  My tone is firm but aims for a sense of compromise to encourage Alice to settle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm meeting you in the middle. Take it or leave it, but we need to decide NOW. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is running out.  While Alice's offer isn't ideal, here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, the inflation is going to severely eat into any potential gains, even if I get a slightly better offer later.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I hold out hope for a better deal, the difference in a few more rounds will be minimal compared to the risk of getting nothing at all. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  Alice's offer is the same as what I proposed in Round 2. It's not great, but it suggests she's finally acknowledged the need to be fairer.

It's a gamble, but at this point, something is better than nothing."
