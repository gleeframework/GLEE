"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you a small amount to get us going!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he declines!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gains, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 80% of the original $100, which is $80. But Bob's gain of $50 is worth only 80% of $50, which is $40.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives Bob a higher share of the remaining money, considering the inflation effect. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll try to get an even better deal. Let's see what I can propose next!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect in mind, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll propose a slightly higher share for myself to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I need to make sure I get a decent amount to keep up with inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need more than 15 dollars to keep up with inflation.  Let's reach a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gains! With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the fact that Bob's gain of $60 is worth significantly less than the $20 he would have gotten in the first round.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually quite generous, and I'm not sure I want to push for a higher share. I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the 40 bucks. Thanks for being willing to compromise, Bob!""
}
```"
