4500.0,5500.0,"I propose a 55/45 split.  This is more fair in the long run, considering the inflation we're facing. It gives you a good amount now, and still leaves me with a comfortable share after the devaluation.",Bob,2,

6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. It's a good deal considering your share devalues quickly. If you decline, we'll both lose out significantly.",Alice,3,
