"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to make the most of the initial round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A chance to reconsider, Alice? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to sweeten the deal! With the money being worth less due to inflation, I need to reevaluate my priorities.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, as it's a better deal than the one I initially proposed. I'll take the $200,000 and we can move on to the next round.
