"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money and leave 20% for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair and square split, hoping Bob will see it that way too!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good one! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 5% less this round, I'll have to adjust my expectations. In terms of the actual value I'll receive, Bob's offer is:

* My gain: 70 / (0.95) = 73.68 (in terms of the original value)
* Bob's gain: 30 / (0.95) = 31.58

Given the inflation, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to bite! My offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""A slight improvement from my previous offer. Hope you'll accept this one!""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous, but still keeping a significant majority of the money for myself. Fingers crossed Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving away too much! 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! In terms of the original value, Bob's offer is:

* My gain: 65 / (0.858) = 75.69
* Bob's gain: 35 / (0.858) = 40.71

Considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I think I should be more aggressive in my negotiations. However, this offer is still a decent one, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept the offer.
