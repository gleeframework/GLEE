"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, Bob. Take 10% and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45.  I think that's a fair compromise, considering the inflation factor.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, Bob. This split is still more favorable for you than the previous round. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, Alice's offer is better than the previous round's, and the inflation is becoming a bigger concern. Let's end this game."
