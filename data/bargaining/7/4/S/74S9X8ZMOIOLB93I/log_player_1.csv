"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start, I'll be generous!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly opening offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50-50 split, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $4,750.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50-50 split is a fair start, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
