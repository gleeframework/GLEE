"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal, but I'll give you a fair offer for now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to give me a fair offer now that he knows I'll have less to gain in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 5000$. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value."
