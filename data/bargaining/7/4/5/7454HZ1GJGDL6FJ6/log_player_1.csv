"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is a good starting point and Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split considering the potential inflation.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so my new gain is 8000 * 0.9 = 7200.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have 4500, which is worth 4500 * 0.9 = 4050 in the first round's value.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, as I'd like to aim for a higher share. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure this is fair, I'd like to try for a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the second round, so my new gain is 7200 * 0.9 = 6480.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better share. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to avoid further risk of inflation.  It's the safest option for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so my new gain is 7200 * 0.727 = 5234.8.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have 5000, which is worth 5000 * 0.727 = 3637 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option, but I'm getting a bit concerned about the value of the money decreasing with each round. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about splitting it evenly, I'd like to try for a bit more.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the second round, so my new gain is 6480 * 0.727 = 4711.76.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better share. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
