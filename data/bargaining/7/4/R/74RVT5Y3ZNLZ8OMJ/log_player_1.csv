"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer, splitting the $1,000,000 evenly between us. This way, we both get $500,000, and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get peanuts if we wait, let's take what we can get now 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual value.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $200,000, which is worth 80% of the original $250,000 (since $200,000 is 80% of $250,000).

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I don't want to risk waiting for a potentially better deal in future rounds. I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
