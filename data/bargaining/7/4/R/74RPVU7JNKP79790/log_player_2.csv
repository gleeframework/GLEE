"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm feeling generous today! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject. There's no reason to accept a deal where I get less than half, especially since the money is worth more to me right now. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""It's your turn to be generous. I'm offering you a fair split, considering the value of money decreases for you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value may be decreasing, Bob, but so is my patience.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, Alice's patience is wearing thin, and the value of the money to her is decreasing faster than mine. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, while rejecting might risk getting nothing at all."
