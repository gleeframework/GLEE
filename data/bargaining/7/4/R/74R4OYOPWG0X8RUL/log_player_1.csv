"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split. I figure this gives Bob a good starting point, and since I'm the one making the offer, I'll take the majority.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept this offer. Bob's offer gives me a decent amount, and the money will be worth less to him in the next round.  I'll take what I can get!"
