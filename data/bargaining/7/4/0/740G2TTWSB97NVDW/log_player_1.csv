"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. $6,000 is a significant amount, but I was hoping for a bit more. However, I also don't want to risk waiting for a worse offer in future rounds.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial amount. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000. I'm hoping this offer is more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we should split it evenly this time. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! I need to be careful with my decisions.

Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I'm not sure if I can do better. Splitting it evenly might be a good idea, considering the risks of inflation and the limited time left.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
