"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 65%, you take 35%.  It's in your best interest to settle early, as the value decreases faster for you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what happens with a counter offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm taking a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still leaving you with a significant amount.  We can end this now, or we can see how much more we can lose in the next round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the inflation.  I'm willing to compromise with 56% for me and 44% for you. Let's be reasonable and end this before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. Even though it's less than my previous proposal, the inflation is making the money worth less and less each round, and it's better to take a slightly smaller share now than risk getting even less later."
