I propose that I get $999,999, and Bob gets $1. I'm aiming for the best possible outcome for myself, knowing that the money loses value each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm still aiming for the best possible outcome for myself, but I need to consider the inflation and Bob's willingness to negotiate. I'm offering slightly less than in round 1 to show flexibility, while still aiming for a significant share."
