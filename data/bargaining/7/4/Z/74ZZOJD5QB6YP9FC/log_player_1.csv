"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving away too much just yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll consider the effective gain as follows:

My gain: 6000 / 0.95 (due to 5% inflation) = 6315.79
Bob's gain: 4000 / 0.9 (due to 10% inflation) = 4444.44

Considering the effective gains, I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.
