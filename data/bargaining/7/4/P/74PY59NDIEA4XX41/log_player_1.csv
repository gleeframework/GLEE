"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob made the same offer as I did in Round 1!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. My gain of 400,000$ is now worth 320,000$ (80% of 400,000$), and Bob's gain of 600,000$ is now worth 540,000$ (90% of 600,000$).

I'll reject this offer since it's not in my favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to get a larger share of the money now. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm keeping a larger share for myself. The message is a bit more aggressive to try to sway Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to do this, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

My gain of 700,000$ in Round 3 would be worth 357,600$ (48.8% of 700,000$), and Bob's gain of 300,000$ would be worth 217,100$ (27.1% of 300,000$).

Now, let's compare Bob's offer in Round 4: I would get 500,000$, which is worth 360,000$ (72% of 500,000$), and Bob would get 500,000$, which is worth 454,500$ (90.9% of 500,000$).

This offer is actually more favorable to me than my previous gain in Round 3, considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
