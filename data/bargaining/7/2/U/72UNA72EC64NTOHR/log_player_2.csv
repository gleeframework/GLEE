Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to make this worthwhile with the inflation.  How about we split it 57/43? 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, the offer is still not favorable considering the rapid inflation for both of us. It's better to hold out for a more balanced deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. The inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This is my final offer, let's close the deal and avoid losing more money.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm bumping my share slightly while still offering Alice a majority.  The ""final offer"" tactic adds pressure, and the mention of losing more money due to inflation strengthens the need for a quick agreement."
