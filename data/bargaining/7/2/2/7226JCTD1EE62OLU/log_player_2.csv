"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. This way we both get a decent share before the inflation hits too hard.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting you harder than me. Let's be reasonable. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is working against me, and Alice's offer is better than the potential of losing even more in the next round."
