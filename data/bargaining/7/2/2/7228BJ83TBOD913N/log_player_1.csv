Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the money is worth less than in the first round, I'm still getting a significant gain. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and it avoids the risk of even further inflation in subsequent rounds."
