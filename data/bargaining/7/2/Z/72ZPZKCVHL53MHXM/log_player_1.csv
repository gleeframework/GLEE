"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, it's a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 95% of the original value, which is $47.50. Bob's gain of $50 is now worth 90% of the original value, which is $45.

I think meeting halfway is a good compromise, so I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
