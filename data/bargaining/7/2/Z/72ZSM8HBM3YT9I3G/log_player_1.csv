"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
``` 

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. Since the money depreciates faster for Bob, I'm hoping he'll accept even with a very small share to avoid losing even more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is very unfavorable, the money I get will be worth less with each passing round. Accepting this offer will at least give me something."
