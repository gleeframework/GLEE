"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $55, leaving Bob with $45. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is an attempt to persuade Bob that this division is reasonable, considering we both want to maximize our gains but also need to find a mutually acceptable agreement to avoid further rounds that would decrease the value of the money due to inflation. By starting with a slightly higher offer for myself, I'm setting a baseline for negotiations while also showing willingness to share a substantial amount with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because accepting $45 after the first round's rejection would mean I'm not only getting less than what I initially proposed but also losing value due to inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'm effectively getting even less value than the face value of $45. Given that Bob is also losing value due to inflation (10% less for him), I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more favorable split for both of us. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a new proposal in the next round, potentially finding a middle ground that accounts for the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, considering the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, I'm proposing a division that slightly favors me but still acknowledges the decreasing value of the money for both parties. By suggesting $52 for myself and $48 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a compromise that is closer to the middle ground than my initial offer, taking into account that we both lose if we continue to reject offers. The message ""Meet in the middle considering inflation"" is meant to convey my awareness of the urgency to reach an agreement due to the devaluing money and my willingness to compromise to end the game with a mutually acceptable division."
