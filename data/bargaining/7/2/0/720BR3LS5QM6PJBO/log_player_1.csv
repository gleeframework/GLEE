"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the effective value of the money I gain is now 60% of what it was in the first round, and the value of Bob's gain is 90% of what it was in the first round.

After some consideration, I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70, and I rejected it, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me, considering the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}"
