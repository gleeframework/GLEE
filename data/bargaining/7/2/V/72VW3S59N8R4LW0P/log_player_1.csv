Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's start with a fair split.  I propose $5,000 for me and $5,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer. Due to inflation, I need to gain more than $4,000 to make the same value as my initial proposal. I'm willing to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Although inflation has reduced the value of the money I gain, I'm choosing to accept. This is a better offer than Bob's previous proposal, and the loss from inflation is getting more significant with each round."
