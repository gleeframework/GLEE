"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a chance here, but I think we can do better with a more even split. Let's try 60/40, favoring me slightly since inflation will be working against you more strongly in the next round.  This seems like a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
