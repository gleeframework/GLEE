"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's start with a fair split, but remember, each round is worth less. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this seems like a generous offer from Alice, it's important to remember that each round decreases the value of the money. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to propose a split that benefits him more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm offering a split that benefits us both, and avoids the risk of losing value each round. Let's finalize this now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than Bob's last offer. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While Alice's offer is less than what Bob proposed in the previous round, it's important to remember the diminishing value of the money. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial amount for Bob, whereas continuing the game risks losing even more due to inflation. It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk getting a worse deal in the future."
