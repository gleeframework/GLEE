"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair and gives me a good amount of money.  It's better to take it now than risk inflation eating away at my potential gains in later rounds."
