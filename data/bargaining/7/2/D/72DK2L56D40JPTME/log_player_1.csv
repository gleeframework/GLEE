"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you can take $4,000. What do you say?""
}
```

This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the risk of inflation. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 5% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 * 0.95 = 3800
* Bob gain: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400

Considering the new proposal, I think a 60/40 split is indeed more favorable to Bob, but I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. How about a 55/45 split?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 5% less than in the second round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3800 * 0.95 = 3610
* Bob gain: 5400 * 0.9 = 4860

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'll take $5,200 and you can take $4,800.""
}
