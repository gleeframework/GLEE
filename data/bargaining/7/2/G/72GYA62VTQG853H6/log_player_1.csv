{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm looking for a more balanced split, and $4000 for me is a bit too low. I'll wait for Bob's next offer to see if we can find a better compromise."
