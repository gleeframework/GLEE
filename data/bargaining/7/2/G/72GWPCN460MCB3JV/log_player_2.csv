"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. Let's work together to find a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. It's not a good starting point for me, and I think we can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation factor. Let's talk about it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation, but I think we can still find a more balanced split. Let's compromise on a 60/40 split, with me taking 60% this time. I'm willing to negotiate further if you have other ideas. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While a 60/40 split in my favor would have been preferable, I'm willing to accept a fair compromise to avoid losing out altogether due to inflation."
