"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Considering the reduced value, I'll have to be more aggressive in my decision-making.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
