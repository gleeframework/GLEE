"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob, I see you're playing tough.  I'm willing to compromise, but we need to find a middle ground.  Let's split it 60/40, and we can both walk away with a decent chunk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, accepting now would still give her a significantly larger share.  Given the rapid inflation for Alice, it's highly likely she'll be more open to a better deal for me in the next couple of rounds."
