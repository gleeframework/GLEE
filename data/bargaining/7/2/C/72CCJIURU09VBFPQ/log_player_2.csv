# Alice's message: You're running out of time, be reasonable! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her demands while taking advantage of my shrinking pot.  I need to hold firm and make it clear that I won't accept a deal where I'm massively disadvantaged by the inflation.  There's still time for her to become more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option. Take it or leave it.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split was a nice try, but I'm in the driver's seat now. 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  

Alice is clearly enjoying her position of power and knows the inflation is hurting me.  However, accepting $4100 at this stage sets a terrible precedent. There's a good chance she'll try to push for an even worse deal in the next round. I need to show her I'm willing to walk away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm compromising.  This is my final offer - take it and let's both walk away with something.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to send a clear message that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but not at any cost. By slightly increasing my previous offer, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate.  However, making it my ""final offer"" emphasizes that time is running out and I'm not willing to be endlessly strung along as inflation eats into my share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of options, take this or risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical. While $3,900 is significantly less than I aimed for, rejecting this offer carries a massive risk.  With only three rounds remaining and Alice aware of my dwindling returns, there's a real chance she'll lowball me even further in the hopes that I'll panic and accept anything to avoid getting nothing. Taking this offer guarantees a return, albeit smaller than I'd like."
