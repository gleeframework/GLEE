"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split is a good starting point, let's see if we can get closer to it 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less, so $5000 is equivalent to $6000 in the first round.

I'm not interested in a 50/50 split, so I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, let's see if we can find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the offers so far, I think Bob is trying to inch closer to a 50/50 split. I'll consider his latest offer and decide to accept it, as it's a reasonable compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
