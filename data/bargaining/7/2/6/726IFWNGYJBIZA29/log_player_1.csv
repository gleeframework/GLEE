Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me (Alice) receiving $90 and Bob receiving $10.  This is a relatively fair offer in my opinion, while still leaving room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to try and split the difference this time. I'm proposing a 70/30 split, giving me $70 and Bob $30.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and I hope it will be more appealing to Bob."
