"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent amount to make him more likely to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more money, the inflation factor makes accepting this offer the best choice. If I reject, I lose a significant amount of money in the next round, and Bob might offer even less then."
