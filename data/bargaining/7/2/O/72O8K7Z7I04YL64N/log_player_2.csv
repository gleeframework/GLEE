"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Bob, considering the risk and uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth risking one round to see if I can get a better deal. I'll see what kind of offer I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I propose a 9:1 split in my favor. It's a risky move, but I believe in my negotiation skills. Let's see if you're willing to take the risk and move to the next round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I propose a more even split of 6:4. This offers a safer option for both of us, avoiding the high-risk scenario of the previous round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is much fairer than my previous proposal and guarantees me a decent share of the money. While the inflation has affected my potential earnings, accepting this offer ensures a stable outcome."
