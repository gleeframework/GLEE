"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start, and we can negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $6,000. This is a fair starting point, and we can discuss and adjust from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, but I'll give you a slight advantage since you made the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,000 in the first round.

I'm not convinced that Bob is giving me a significant advantage, considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain will be worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $3,200 and Bob gets $6,800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to account for inflation, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the original amount. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3,200 in round 3 is now worth 41.6% of what it was in the first round (64% of 64% = 41.6%). So, the equivalent value in the first round would be approximately $1,344.

I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous, considering the original amount. I'd like to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain will be worth 32.768% of what it was in the first round (41.6% of 80% of 80% = 32.768%). I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2304,
  ""bob_gain"": 7696,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation and the original amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $2,304 and Bob gets $7,696."
