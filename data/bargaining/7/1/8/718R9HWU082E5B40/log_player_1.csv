"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure you're being entirely fair, let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $285,000. I'm not happy with this proposal, as I was hoping to get a larger share. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $427,000. I'm not thrilled with this proposal, as I was hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject it.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,

}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers."
