"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I think we can find a more balanced split that takes into account the inflation we both face. This offer gives you a decent share, but it also allows me to get a larger portion before the money depreciates too much. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
