"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly considering the risk and fairness. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is seemingly fair, it's in Bob's best interest to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round. Inflation means the money will be worth less with each passing round, so Bob has a strong incentive to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's flip the script! This time, I'm offering a split that's fairer for me, considering the risk of further inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split, considering both our positions and the uncertainty of future inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Bob could technically hold out for a better deal, the risk of further inflation makes an even split increasingly appealing. The 9.75% loss in value for Bob's potential earnings makes accepting Alice's offer the more sensible choice."
