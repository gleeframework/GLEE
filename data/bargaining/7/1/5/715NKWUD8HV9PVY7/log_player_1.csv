Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's not a generous offer at all! Let's be reasonable.  I'm proposing a more equitable split. This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away at your share. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
