"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a relatively fair split, where I get $5500 and Bob gets $4500. My message to Bob is ""Let's split fairly"". I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, ending the game quickly before inflation reduces the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly.  It's a fair deal, and we can avoid the inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nBob's offer is a perfectly even split, and considering the inflation penalty that will continue to reduce the value of the money in subsequent rounds, accepting this offer ensures I get a fair share without risking further loss due to inflation. It makes sense to accept and end the game here."
