"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer from Bob!

I accept his proposal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
