"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll have to take that into account. If I accept this offer, I'll get $45, but it's effectively worth $45 * 0.95 = $42.75 compared to the first round.

Considering this, I'll...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 55, and the money is worth 5% less for him in each round, I'll try to take advantage of that. I'll make a new offer that's slightly more favorable to me.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer in Round 1, taking into account the cumulative inflation:

Round 1: $100
Round 2: $100 * 0.95 = $95
Round 3: $95 * 0.95 = $90.25
Round 4: $90.25 * 0.85 = $76.88

So, Bob's offer of $51 in Round 4 is equivalent to $51 / 0.7678 â‰ˆ $66.37 in Round 1 dollars.

Considering this, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer...
