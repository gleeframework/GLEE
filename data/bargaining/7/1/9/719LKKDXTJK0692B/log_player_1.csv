"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering you 30 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 70 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money I'll gain due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I accept Bob's offer:
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
