"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While 2500 is something, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  The inflation is a big factor, and I need to consider how it will affect me in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation will impact Alice more significantly than it will me.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While the inflation has reduced the value of the money, it's better to take the 4000 now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds. Alice's offer is more favorable than my own, and the risk of getting nothing outweighs the potential for a higher gain."
