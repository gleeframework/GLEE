Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not willing to give up more than 40% of the total. Let's divide the money in a 6:4 ratio. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
