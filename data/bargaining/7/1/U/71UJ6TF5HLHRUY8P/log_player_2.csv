"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I need to look out for myself too. This offer is better for both of us in the long run.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting the first offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her.  It's strategically important to show you're not willing to accept an unfair deal.
* **Slight advantage in Round 2:** Offering Alice slightly less than she'd get by accepting in Round 3 (480,000 vs. 600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000) gives her a small incentive to accept now. 
* **Future discounting:** By emphasizing the ""long run,"" the message subtly reminds Alice about the decreasing value of the money. It makes a slightly smaller share now seem more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 424000 
# Alice gain: 576000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Holding out for a much better deal is becoming riskier.
* **Improved offer:** While still favoring Alice, her offer is closer to a 50/50 split than her initial proposal.
* **Potential losses:** If I reject, there's a good chance I'll end up with even less in subsequent rounds. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount."
