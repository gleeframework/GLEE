"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take this generous offer and let's be friends!""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but don't expect to get more than 40% 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with less than 50% of the total amount. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! This is a fair split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to 50-50, while still being a bit more generous to myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get closer to the 50-50 split, but still wants to keep a slight edge.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll accept this offer, as it's getting close to the 50-50 split and I don't want to risk going to another round and losing more value due to inflation."
