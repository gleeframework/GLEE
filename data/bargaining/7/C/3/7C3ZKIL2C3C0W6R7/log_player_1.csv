{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it from a relative perspective. Bob is offering me $4000, which is 20% less than my initial proposal of $5000. On the other hand, he's keeping $6000, which is 20% more than his initial proposal of $5000.

I'll reject this offer for now and hope to do better in the next round.
