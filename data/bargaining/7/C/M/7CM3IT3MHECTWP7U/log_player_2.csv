Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation on your share. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** While Alice's offer isn't ideal, waiting any longer means the value of Bob's potential gain will decrease significantly due to inflation. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  Her language (""final offer"", ""take it or leave it"") suggests she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a massive risk of getting nothing if Bob can't secure a better deal in the remaining rounds.

While a 50/50 split seemed fair, Alice has demonstrated a strong preference for a larger share. Accepting this offer cuts Bob's losses and ensures he receives a substantial sum."
