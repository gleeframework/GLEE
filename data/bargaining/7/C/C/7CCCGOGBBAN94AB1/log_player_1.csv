"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to give Bob a decent share to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. How about a 50/50 split? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations. Since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll consider it carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more, considering the initial offer was 60/40 and I had to adjust for inflation.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 50/50 split just yet. I'll wait for another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering the reduced value of money, I'm willing to offer you 45% of the total. Let's meet somewhere in the middle.""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, given the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about I take 55% and you take 45%? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are adding up! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be cautious. Bob's new offer is a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in his favor than my previous offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll accept your offer, Bob. 45% is still a decent share, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with the money's value decreasing further.""
}
```

I'll take the 45% and call it a day."
