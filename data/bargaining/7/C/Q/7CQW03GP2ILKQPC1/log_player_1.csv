"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can always negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount to try to leave room for negotiation. My message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the game."
