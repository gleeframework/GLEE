"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I'm not getting a good enough share of the total."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm proposing a slightly skewed split in my favor, with me getting 55% and Bob getting 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... This offer is identical to my offer in Round 3, but with the inflation effect taken into account. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm actually getting less than 55% of the original amount. I'll think about it...

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair deal considering the inflation effect."
