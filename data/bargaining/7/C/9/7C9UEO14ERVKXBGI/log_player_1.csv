"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from the money now.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this offer is more balanced and prevents significant loss from inflation as the game goes on. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting better for him and worse for me with each round.  While he's right that waiting too long will reduce the total value due to inflation, I need to hold out for a better deal.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to achieve a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is the same split you offered me, only reversed.  It's time to be realistic about what's fair.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer acknowledges your initial desire for a higher share while accounting for the increasing impact of inflation. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, this offer is better than what Bob initially proposed. Accepting now prevents further losses due to inflation, which is increasingly impacting my potential gains. It's time to secure a reasonable amount rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
