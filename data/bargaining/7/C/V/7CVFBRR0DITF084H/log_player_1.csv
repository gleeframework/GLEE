"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is $2000. I'm keeping 80% for myself, which is $8000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split, as I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still in the driver's seat""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but still more than in my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","After considering Bob's new offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to meet in the middle, and Bob's offer seems reasonable given the reduced value of money due to inflation. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
