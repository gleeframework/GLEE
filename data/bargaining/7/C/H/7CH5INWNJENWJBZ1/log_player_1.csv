"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable starting offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain remains the same value as in Round 1, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I think I'm getting a better deal this time.

I accept the offer.
