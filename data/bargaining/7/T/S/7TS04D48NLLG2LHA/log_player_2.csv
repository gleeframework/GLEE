Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time.  We both lose money with each round, and I think an even split is the best way to make sure we both get something.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
An even split is fair, and the longer we wait, the less we both get.  Let's call it a day!"
