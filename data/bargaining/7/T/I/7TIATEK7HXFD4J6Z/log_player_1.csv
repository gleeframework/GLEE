"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, my initial 600,000$ is now worth 540,000$. I'm not sure if I want to accept Bob's offer, as I could potentially get more in future rounds.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value. My target is to maximize my share, so I'll aim for a higher percentage.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! The original 1,000,000$ is now worth around 729,000$ (90% * 90% * 90% * 90% * 90% * 90% * 90% * 90% * 90% * 90% * 90% * 90% * 90% = 0.729).

Considering the reduced value, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money's value decreasing further, I'll aim for an even higher percentage to compensate for the loss. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm sticking to my original ratio, but adjusting the actual values to account for the inflation."
