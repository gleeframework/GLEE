I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This ensures a significant gain for me while still offering Bob a small share.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is still a generous offer to Bob, considering the inflation rates. I believe it's a fair compromise after the previous rounds."
