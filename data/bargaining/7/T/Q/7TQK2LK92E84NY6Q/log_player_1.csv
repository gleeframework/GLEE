Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a good starting point.  However, to account for the money's decreasing value for me, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile.  This offer is fair considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200
