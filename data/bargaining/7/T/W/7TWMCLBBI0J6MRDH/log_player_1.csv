"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $6,000 offer from Round 1 is now worth $5,700.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think 50-50 is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer.
