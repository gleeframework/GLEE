"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need for a long negotiation""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 and can see how the game goes from here."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for me since I'm the one making the proposal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a better offer in the next round."
