"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob receives $2,000. I'm starting with a fair split and hoping Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a closer split is more fair. Let's see if this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with the 55-45 split. I was hoping for a more equal split, and this offer is still quite lopsided. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 60-40 is a fairer split""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob receives $4,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground and give Bob a slightly larger share than in my initial offer."
