Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This is a fairer split considering time is on my side. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 
 
This offer is worse for me than the initial offer, and the impact of inflation isn't significant enough yet to warrant accepting a worse deal. Bob's advantage with the inflation rates will hopefully encourage him to make a better offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Bob. This offer is still good for both of us, but I need a bigger share to account for the decreasing value.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  This offer ensures we both benefit significantly despite the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Bob is still trying to inch closer to a 50/50 split, knowing that time benefits him more.  I need to hold firm for a better deal, as his offers are getting closer to my initial offer after accounting for inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This is a compromise, Bob. We're both losing value fast. Let's settle this now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth is pointless. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

Bob is unlikely to offer anything better than a 50/50 split, and with the inflation increasing, this is as good as it's going to get for me. Accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
