"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 30%. The message is a friendly reminder that my offer is a good one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight improvement, but I'm still not convinced. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

If Bob's offer is accepted, I'll get $6000, which is worth 60% of the original $10,000. However, due to the 20% inflation, it's actually worth 48% of the original amount ($6000 / 0.8 = 7500 / 1.2 = 6250).

Bob's gain is $4000, which is worth 40% of the original $10,000. Due to the 5% inflation, it's actually worth 38.5% of the original amount ($4000 / 0.95 = 4211.58).

Considering this, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth even less, so I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, I'll aim to get a larger share. I'll propose:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the remaining $10,000, and Bob gets 20%. The message is a bit more assertive this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Let's try to find a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money is worth even less, and the inflation rates are higher. I'll have to recalculate the values.

If Bob's offer is accepted, I'll get $7500, which is worth 75% of the original $10,000. However, due to the 48.8% inflation, it's actually worth 39.6% of the original amount ($7500 / 0.528 = 7142.31).

Bob's gain is $2500, which is worth 25% of the original $10,000. Due to the 14.26% inflation, it's actually worth 21.55% of the original amount ($2500 / 0.8586 = 2911.59).

Considering this, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a fairer split considering the inflation rates."
