"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable starting point for our negotiations. I hope Bob will consider it and we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and proceed to the next round. The 55-45 split in his favor doesn't seem fair to me, and I think I can get a better deal. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nConsidering the inflation and the previous offers, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer a 58-42 split, which is closer to the middle ground. I hope Bob will see this as a fair and reasonable offer and accept it."
