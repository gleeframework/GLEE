"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $200,000 and keep $800,000 for myself.""

Your turn, Bob!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take 450,000 and I'll get 550,000. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $450,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $360,000 in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. I'd like a bit more.
