Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  While she's offering consistent amounts, the value is steadily decreasing for me. It's time to show I'm serious about not getting pushed around.  I'll hold out for a better offer in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option left. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and I need to make a strong move.  Offering a 50/50 split might seem risky, but it:

* **Establishes a firm position:**  I'm showing Alice I'm serious about not accepting less than what's fair.
* **Appeals to her sense of fairness:**  While she's been pushing for more, a 50/50 split is objectively reasonable.
* **Creates a sense of urgency:**  I'm not leaving room for negotiation, pushing her to make a decision. 

This is a gamble, but the stakes are getting higher with each passing round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offers, Bob. The value of your share is plummeting. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

**Situation:**

* **Time pressure:** Only 5 rounds left.
* **Inflation:** My share is rapidly losing value. Accepting 4200 now is like accepting even less later.
* **Alice's strategy:** She's sticking to her guns, hoping I'll crack under pressure.

**Decision:**

While it pains me, I have to  {""decision"": ""reject""} again. 

**Reasoning:**

Accepting now sets a terrible precedent. Alice knows I'm desperate. If I fold now, she'll push even harder in the remaining rounds. There's a chance she'll panic as we get closer to round 12, and might offer a more reasonable split. 

It's a huge risk, but the alternative is likely being slowly bled dry by Alice's stubbornness."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be settled soon."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Retreat:** Offering 4800 is a step back from the 50/50, signaling a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds left, Alice needs to understand the urgency.  
* **Avoiding Extremes:**  Sticking at 50/50 or demanding more could make Alice dig in her heels. This offer shows flexibility while still aiming for a somewhat reasonable split.

This is a calculated risk. There's a chance Alice will interpret this as weakness, but hopefully, she'll see it as a sign I'm willing to make a deal before it's too late."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side, Bob. You're losing value by the round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is agonizing. Let's break it down:

**The Bad:**

* **Alice is ruthless:** She's clearly enjoying this and knows my back is against the wall. 
* **Inflation is killing me:**  4000 now is a pittance compared to what it was at the start.

**The Ugly:**

* **Only 3 rounds left:** If I reject, there's a very real chance we both walk away with nothing.

**The (Slightly) Hopeful:**

* **Alice might panic:** If I reject, *she* faces the pressure of the last two rounds. Maybe, just maybe, she'll offer something decent in Round 10 or 11 out of fear of total loss.

**Decision Time:**

This is a gamble, no matter what. But letting Alice walk all over me after 9 rounds feels worse than taking a chance on those last few rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This is me clutching at straws, hoping for a miracle. It's incredibly risky, but the alternative is accepting a terrible deal that makes me feel like I lost the game from the start."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. Last chance.  Accept this, and we both walk away with something."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  Two rounds left, I need to make my last stand.  
* **Conciliatory but Firm:**  The offer is better than what Alice wants, but it shows I'm willing to end this without completely caving. 
* **Ultimatum:** The ""last chance"" message isn't subtle. It puts the pressure squarely on Alice.  

This is the most difficult decision point. If Alice rejects this, I'm either accepting a terrible deal in Round 11 or risking it all on the very last round.  My hope is that the combination of a decent offer and the very real threat of getting nothing will push Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my earlier offers, Bob. Now you're desperate. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I have no choice.  {""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice played me perfectly. I held out hope for too long, and now I'm left with a terrible choice:

* **Accept this insulting offer:**  It's far less than I wanted, but it's something.
* **Reject and risk getting zero:**  Alice is clearly willing to let the clock run out, and I've given her no reason to believe I'd accept anything less in the final round.

This feels awful, but it's the price of my miscalculation."
