"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too tilted Alice. I'm willing to settle for a bit less than half, but it needs to be closer to even. This seems fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is reasonable considering the circumstances and the impact of inflation:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth.  
* **Bob's Discount:** Bob's share is losing value faster than mine.  He's incentivized to settle sooner. 
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject, I'll need to offer him a better deal in the next round to incentivize him. There's no guarantee I can propose something that benefits me more than his current offer after accounting for another round of inflation.

Accepting now secures a decent amount and avoids the risk of getting a worse deal later."
