Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by taking a large portion of the money, but I want to leave Bob with something. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll reject this offer and hope he comes back with something more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit to see if Bob is willing to compromise. Inflation is hurting me, but I still want to get a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer. Inflation is hurting me, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  I'll reject this offer and hope he comes back with something closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm willing to compromise further. The inflation is starting to really hurt, but I'm still hoping to get a good deal. I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still holding out for more than 50/50."
