Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I figure I can take advantage of the inflation and still leave Bob with a decent amount. It's a risky move, but I believe in my negotiation skills!  Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, it's a huge improvement from my first offer. My gain is significantly less, but the inflation hit me harder, so I'd rather take what I can get now.  Plus, I can't be sure how much inflation will affect me in the next round.  I'll take the guaranteed gain."
