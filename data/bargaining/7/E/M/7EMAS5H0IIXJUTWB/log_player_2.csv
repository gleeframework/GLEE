"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is ridiculously unfair, and while it's tempting to take *something*, it's not worth it in the long run. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
This offer is fair and will ensure that I secure a large portion of the money, even with the inflation effect. I'm confident that Alice will be happy with this, as it's still a sizable sum."
