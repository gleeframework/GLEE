Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the money loses value for Alice but not for me with each passing round, I can try to negotiate for a slightly better deal in my favor, while still being reasonable enough that Alice might consider accepting it, especially since the value of the money will continue to decrease for her if she rejects and we go to another round.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this seems fair.""}"
