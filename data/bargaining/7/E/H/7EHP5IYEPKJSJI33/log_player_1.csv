"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will be eager to get anything at all and accept this offer, especially in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's better to accept and get 50 dollars than risk getting nothing!"
