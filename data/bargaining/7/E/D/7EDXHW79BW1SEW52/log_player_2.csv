"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm hoping for a fair split, but I'm willing to compromise in the beginning. Let's work together to ensure we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message suggests fairness, the offer is highly skewed in her favor.  I'm hoping to get a more equitable split.  Rejecting allows me to make the next offer and try to secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
