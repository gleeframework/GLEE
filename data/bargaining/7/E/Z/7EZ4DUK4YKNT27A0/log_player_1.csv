"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal that lets us both benefit from the full amount before inflation kicks in.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** A 60/40 split slightly favors Alice, the first proposer, which is a common strategy in these games. However, it's not so lopsided as to be immediately rejected by a rational Bob.
* **Time Value of Money:** Emphasizing the impact of inflation encourages Bob to settle quickly rather than risk getting a smaller share later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I'm offering 55/45, which is still a fair deal, but gives us both a slightly larger share. We have time to negotiate further, but the inflation is going to eat away at the value of our money with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the impact of inflation, it's not a significant improvement for Alice. Accepting a 45/55 split in round 2 sets a weak precedent for future negotiations. By rejecting, Alice signals she's willing to negotiate but won't settle for a deal that heavily favors Bob. There's still time to reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about 58/42? It's closer to the middle ground and gives us both a decent share before inflation eats away too much more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice reduces her demand from 60% to 58%, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Anchoring:** By proposing a new number slightly better for Bob than his previous offer, Alice attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to her desired outcome.
* **Urgency:**  The message again highlights the shrinking pot due to inflation, encouraging Bob to accept sooner."
