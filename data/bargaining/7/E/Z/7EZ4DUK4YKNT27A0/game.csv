60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal that lets us both benefit from the full amount before inflation kicks in.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I'm offering 55/45, which is still a fair deal, but gives us both a slightly larger share. We have time to negotiate further, but the inflation is going to eat away at the value of our money with each passing round.",Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about 58/42? It's closer to the middle ground and gives us both a decent share before inflation eats away too much more.",Alice,3,
