"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the $1000000 with a 60/40 split in favor of you, Bob. This offers a good balance considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While the offer is generous, Bob is in a strong position.  Rejecting gives Bob the opportunity to propose a split more in his favor, knowing that the money will depreciate more quickly for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
