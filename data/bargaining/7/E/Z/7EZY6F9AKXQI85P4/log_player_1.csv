Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the $1,000,000 with a 60/40 split in favor of you, Bob. This offers a good balance considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  This takes into account the inflation we'll both experience, and it gives us a chance to finish this game early.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
