"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 30/70, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly better for me. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 35, ""alice_gain"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is affecting me!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll think carefully about Alice's offer. Since my gain is 40, which is worth 19% less than the 50 I would have gotten in the first round, I'll try to get closer to 50. However, I'll also consider the fact that Alice's offer is 60, which is also worth 19% less than the 70 she offered in the first round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping to get a better one in the next round.
