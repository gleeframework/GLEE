I'm starting with a simple 60/40 split.  This seems fair, but I'm also keeping in mind that I'll be losing 20% per round, so I want to get a good chunk of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation factor is significant.  Accepting this offer guarantees me at least some of the money, and delaying might lead to a worse outcome in the next round."
