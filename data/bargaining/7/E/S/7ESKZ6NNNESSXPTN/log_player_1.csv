"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm now considering the proposal from Bob.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd like to get a better deal considering the reduced value of the money. I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm offering a slightly weighted deal in my favor, hoping to take advantage of the reduced value of the money."
