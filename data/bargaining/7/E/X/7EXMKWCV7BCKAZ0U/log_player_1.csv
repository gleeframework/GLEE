Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a very lopsided split, giving Bob just $1. This is because I want to secure as much of the money as possible before inflation kicks in. I'm hoping he'll accept, as he's not losing any value on his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option.  The inflation means I'd be losing a significant amount if we continue playing."
