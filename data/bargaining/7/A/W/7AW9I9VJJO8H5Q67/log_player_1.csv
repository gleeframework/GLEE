"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, so we both get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a 60-40 split in my favor, but with a slight adjustment to account for the inflation.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant portion of the money, in the hopes that he'll accept this time."
