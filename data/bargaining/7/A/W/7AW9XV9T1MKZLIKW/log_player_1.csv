"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message to Bob is that it's a fair deal, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, with me getting 60% since I'm the one making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money I'd gain in this round is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, especially since I think I should get more given the initial offer I made. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
