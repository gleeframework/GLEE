"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. I'm willing to take a smaller share now to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I'm willing to see if he's bluffing and will offer a more reasonable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
