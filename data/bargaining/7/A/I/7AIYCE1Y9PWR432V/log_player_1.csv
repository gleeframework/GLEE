"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""A fair split, considering I'm taking the risk of inflation""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I receive 80% of the initial amount and Bob receives 20%. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A compromise, considering the initial high value of the money 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'm willing to consider Bob's compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
