"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth $6,400 (80% of $8,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate my gain as $5,000, which is worth $4,000 (80% of $5,000) in the current round.

Since I'll be getting $4,000, which is less than what I would have gotten in the first round ($8,000), I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so my gain is worth 64% of the original amount (80% of 80% = 64%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate my gain in round 4, I'll first find the value of my gain in round 3, which was $6,400. Since the money is worth 20% less in each round, I'll multiply $6,400 by 0.8 to get $5,120. Then, I'll multiply $5,120 by 0.808 (1 - 0.192) to get $4,141.76. This is my gain in round 4.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the value of his gain in round 4. Since Bob's gain in round 2 was $5,000, and the money is worth 10% less in each round, I'll multiply $5,000 by 0.9 to get $4,500. Then, I'll multiply $4,500 by 0.727 (1 - 0.273) to get $3,268.95. This is the value of Bob's gain in round 4.

Since I'll be getting $4,141.76, which is more than $3,268.95, I'll accept this offer.
