"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too happy about the 75-25 split, but I think it's a bit more reasonable than the 60-40 I initially proposed. I'm willing to accept this offer, but I'll keep in mind that I'm giving up a significant amount.
