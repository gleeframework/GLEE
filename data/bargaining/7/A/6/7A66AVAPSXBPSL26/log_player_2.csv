"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a small piece to start.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a very unfair offer for the first round. While I understand Alice wants the lion's share, it's better to start with a more balanced proposal to build trust. We have many rounds to negotiate. I will counter with a fairer proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I'm starting with a fair and even split. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. We have plenty of time, so let's be reasonable.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your fairness, Bob. I'm still hoping for a slightly bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, this offer is reasonable considering the inflation and Alice's willingness to compromise. It's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome."
