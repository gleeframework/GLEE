"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of money decreases with each round. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to flip the script!

I'll analyze the offer:

* Alice gain: 4000, which is 10% less than my initial offer of 6000
* Bob gain: 6000, which is the same as his initial offer

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. However, I'll consider the fact that Bob is suggesting a 60-40 split, which is the same as my initial offer. I'll accept this offer for now.
