Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and since the money loses value with each round, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
