"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I'm hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fairer split.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering her a slightly smaller share. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer rather than risking an even smaller share in the next round."
