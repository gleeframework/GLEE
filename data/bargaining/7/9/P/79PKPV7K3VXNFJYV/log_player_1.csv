Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too far in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I propose 4500 for me and 5500 for you.  The clock is ticking, and the money is losing value with every round. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
