"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is the same as the one I made in Round 1, but with the new values due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer as well, since it's not in my favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, and Bob's money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500, and I'll take $4,500."
