"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a generous offer considering I'm giving up a larger share. My message is a gentle nudge to see if we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is actually worth 40 dollars (80% of 50). 

I'll reject this offer because I was hoping for a slightly better deal considering the reduced value of money. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of 50 dollars in the previous round was worth 40 dollars. To adjust for the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good deal, but don't expect more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is a slightly better deal for me considering the reduced value of money."
