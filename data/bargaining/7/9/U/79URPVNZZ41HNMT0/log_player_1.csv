Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money closer to 55/45.  It's a fairer split considering we both lose value over time with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
