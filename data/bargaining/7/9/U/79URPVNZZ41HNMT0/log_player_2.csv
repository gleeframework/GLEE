"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide the money in a 7:3 ratio. I believe this is fair considering the inflation effect in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the 7:3 ratio seems fair in the first round, with the inflation factor, Bob can likely get a better deal in later rounds if he rejects the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money closer to 55/45.  It's a fairer split considering we both lose value over time with inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 6:4 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for inflation. I hope you find it fair. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the 6:4 split is still in Alice's favor, with inflation, Bob's gains are worth the same as they were in round 1, while Alice's gains are diminished. Accepting this offer secures a sizable sum for Bob, and it's better to take a guaranteed amount than risk further rounds and potential losses."
