"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 75/25 split in favor of you, Bob. I believe this is fair considering the risk and potential future inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% of the remaining money, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds. It's a fair split, and I think we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
