"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Reasoning:

While this offer is closer to a more even split, it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor, especially considering the increasing inflation impacting Bob's potential gains. Holding out a bit longer might pressure Alice into a more equitable deal.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  This is my final offer.""}
```

Reasoning:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the inflation eats into Bob's potential gains. It's crucial to apply pressure.
* **Slight Advantage:** This offer still gives Bob a slight advantage, which is reasonable given the inflation disadvantage. 
* **Finality:** The ""final offer"" statement creates a sense of urgency and may prompt Alice to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Reasoning:

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage Bob is facing. She's betting that Bob will cave under pressure. However, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss compared to even Round 1's offer.  Bob needs to hold firm and see if Alice is bluffing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is it Alice - a perfectly fair split. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** By consistently asking for a slight majority, Bob might have anchored Alice's expectations. Now, offering a perfectly even split might seem more appealing to her than it would have earlier.
* **Inflation:** Time is running out for Bob.  The longer this goes on, the less favorable any potential deal becomes. A 50/50 split now is better than risking a worse offer later when the inflation has eaten away at his share even more.
* **Strong Stance:**  The message is firm and signals that Bob is serious about this being his final offer. This further increases the pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'fair split' was too little, too late 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reasoning: 

The game has reached a critical point. Alice is clearly not budging much, and the inflation is rapidly eroding Bob's potential gains. 

* Severe Inflation: A 46.86% reduction is substantial. Waiting longer could mean accepting an even worse offer later, potentially leaving Bob with less than he was offered in Round 1.
* Diminishing Returns:  Continuing to negotiate might not yield significantly better results. Alice seems determined to get a larger share, and Bob's leverage is diminishing with each round.

While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures Bob at least receives something and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
