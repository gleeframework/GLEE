Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair to start with a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and we can adjust from here.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit lopsided. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  This reflects a stronger starting point for me, considering the inflation working against us both.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a bigger share, but let's be reasonable. I'm willing to compromise to a 60/40 split in my favor, considering the ongoing inflation. This gives you a decent gain while still allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating into our potential gains.  I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair deal that gives us both a reasonable share before the money loses even more value.""}
