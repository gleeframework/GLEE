Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, how about this? I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need you to meet me halfway to account for the inflation difference.  This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of the wording ""meet halfway"" to disguise an unfair offer. While a 50/50 split after inflation adjustment might seem fair, remember that the inflation disproportionately affects Alice. 

It's still early in the game, and Alice's desperation to secure a deal will likely increase with each round.  We can push for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **Strategic Simplicity:** A 50/50 split is easy to understand and difficult for Alice to argue against.
*   **Time Pressure:** By round 4, the impact of inflation is becoming more significant.  A firm offer emphasizes the need for a quick resolution.
*   **Fairness Appeal:** While we know Alice is more affected by inflation, framing the offer as ""fair"" might make her more receptive than a continued back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a solution that benefits us both. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure and the inflation working against us. It's a fair deal â€“ let's seal the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is better than what we might get if we continue to play. Here's why:

* **Increasing Risk:** The further we go, the more we both lose to inflation.  Alice seems to finally be acknowledging this, but there's no guarantee she'll offer something better in the later rounds.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the pressure is on. There's a real chance we could end up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement soon.
* **Acceptable Compromise:** Although Alice is still getting a slightly better deal, the difference isn't as significant anymore. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, rather than gambling on an uncertain future."
