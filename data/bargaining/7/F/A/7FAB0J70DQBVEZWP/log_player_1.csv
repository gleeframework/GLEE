  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early.""

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I'm considering the offer carefully.

However, I think I can do better than 300,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreased value.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get a better deal to account for the inflation.""

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I need to be cautious. However, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him, considering the value of the money has decreased significantly.
