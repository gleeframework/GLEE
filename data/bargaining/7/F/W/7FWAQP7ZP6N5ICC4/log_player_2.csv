"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early! 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  Even though I get nothing now, I can potentially get a better offer in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split is the most equitable way to divide the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Take 40 and I'll take 60. Let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a 50/50 split, accepting this offer ensures I get something.  The inflation is hurting my potential gains, so it's better to secure a deal now rather than risk getting nothing at all."
