"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, but I'm trying to be nice and offer a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split is the most equitable way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain would be worth 95% of the original amount, which is $95. Bob's gain would be worth 80% of the original amount, which is $80.

I'm not sure if this is the most equitable way to divide the money, considering the inflation adjustment. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to think about it, Bob. Can you offer something better?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain would be worth 90.25% of the original amount, which is $90.25.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Take 40 and I'll take 60. Let's end this!""
}
```"
