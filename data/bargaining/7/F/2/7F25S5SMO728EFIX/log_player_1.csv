I propose to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. I believe this is a fair offer as it allows for a substantial gain for me while still providing Bob with a small portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}

I propose to take $8,100 and leave $1,900 for Bob.  This is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's desire for a larger share, while still allowing me to secure a significant portion of the available funds."
