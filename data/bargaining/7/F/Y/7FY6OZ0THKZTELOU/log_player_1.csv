"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. My message is a straightforward one, suggesting a 4:1 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $4,000 in Round 2 is actually worth $3,200 (80% of $4,000).

I'm not too thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept his proposal.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
