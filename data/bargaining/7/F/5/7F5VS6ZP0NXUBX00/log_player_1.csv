"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more suitable. This way, we both get a decent share, and it accounts for the devaluation of money over the rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
