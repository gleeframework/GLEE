"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think 80/20 is a more balanced split, considering the initial offer was too skewed. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
