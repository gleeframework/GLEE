"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I was hoping for a more equal split, and Bob's offer is still quite biased towards him. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all. The inflation is taking a big toll on my share, and Bob's offer is still very biased towards him. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I need to be careful not to run out of time, though!"
