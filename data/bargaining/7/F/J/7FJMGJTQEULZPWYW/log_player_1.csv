Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It seems like a fair starting point, given that I lose less value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, considering the inflation rates and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
