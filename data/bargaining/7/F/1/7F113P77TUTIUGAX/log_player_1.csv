"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I'm more eager to accept a deal.

I accept Bob's offer.
