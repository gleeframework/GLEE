"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you take 20%.""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively even split, but I'm not giving up too much in case Bob rejects this offer and we have to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still be fair. Your turn to think about it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to accept a smaller share. However, I'm not sure if 6000 is a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a bigger share to account for the inflation. Think carefully, Bob!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Your turn to think about it! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money being worth 48.8% less than the initial amount, I need to be careful with my decisions.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if 5500 is a good deal for me. I'll have to think carefully about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value! I'll have to be even more aggressive with my offer to account for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I need a bigger share to make up for the inflation. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Alice. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on the money's value! With the money being worth 67.23% less than the initial amount, I'm not sure if 5000 is a good deal for me.

However, the fact that Bob is willing to meet me in the middle suggests that he's getting desperate too. I'm not sure if I can do better than this offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer and hope that it's the best deal I can get."
