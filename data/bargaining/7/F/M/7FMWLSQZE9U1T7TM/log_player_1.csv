"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6,000, which is 60%. I think this is a reasonable and fair split. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being generous, but we need to act fast before inflation eats our money! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think Bob's offer is generous enough, considering the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, let's split the difference and be done!""
}


Considering the money is now worth even less, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than my initial offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more than Bob offered me last round. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
