Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness in the first round.  However, I believe a more balanced split is in our mutual interest, and will help us both avoid losing too much to inflation.  Let's move forward with this slight adjustment. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
