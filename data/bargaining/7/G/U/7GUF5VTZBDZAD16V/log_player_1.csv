"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower offer, but I think it's a good starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, my new gain is 4500 (5000 * 0.9).

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too skewed towards you, I'd like to propose a counteroffer""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I deserve a slightly higher share, considering the inflation factor. Now it's my turn to make a counteroffer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, my gain is worth 90% of the original amount, so I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which takes into account the decreased value of my gain due to inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the fact that my offer from round 2 was more generous than this one. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, my new gain is 3635 (5000 * 0.727).

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too skewed towards you, and I think you're not taking into account the inflation effect on my gain""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I deserve a fairer share, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, my gain is worth 72.7% of the original amount, so I'll propose a new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is the fairest split considering the inflation""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which takes into account the decreased value of my gain due to inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
