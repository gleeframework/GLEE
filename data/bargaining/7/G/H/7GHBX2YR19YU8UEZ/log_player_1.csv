Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I want to see how Bob reacts. If he rejects it, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to get 70 now than risk getting nothing in the next round.  The inflation is going to hurt Bob more, so he's likely to accept a lower offer than he might have in the first round."
