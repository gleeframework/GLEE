"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a large offer for myself, but leaving a small amount for Bob in the hopes of securing his acceptance. This way, I maximize my potential earnings while still giving him a reason to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial gain, especially considering the inflation.  It's a fair split, and rejecting it risks losing more in the future."
