"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This is a fair initial offer that leaves room for negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it's better than what I got in the first round, I believe I can get a better deal. With inflation affecting my earnings more than Bob's, I need to negotiate harder to secure a more advantageous split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I propose taking 85% of the money, leaving 15% for Bob. This is a compromise from my first offer, acknowledging Bob's increasing share due to inflation. However, I still need to secure a sizable share to counteract the inflation's impact on my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While the inflation is hurting my earnings, I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal. I'll need to be more aggressive in my counter-offers to compensate for the increasing disparity in inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm proposing a split of 75% for me and 25% for Bob.  The inflation is really biting into my potential earnings now, so I need to be realistic about the offer, but I'm still aiming for a majority share.  I'll need to be more flexible in future rounds, but for now, I'm holding firm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation is severely impacting my potential earnings, accepting this offer is the best option at this point.  I'm now earning significantly less than I would have in earlier rounds, and rejecting this offer could lead to a worse outcome. Accepting ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all."
