"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain is now worth less. I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

I don't think I'm being too generous, but I'm not sure I want to give Bob a 60/40 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the inflation and Bob's previous offer. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 45/55 split, which is a bit more generous than the 40/60 split he proposed, but still not as generous as my initial 50/50 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I need more to compensate for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gains. I'm not sure I want to give Bob such a large share, especially considering he rejected my previous offers.

I think I'll reject this offer as well. I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains. I need to be more aggressive in my offer to account for the devaluation of the money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic about the inflation, but I'm not going to give you the whole pie.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 32/68 split, which is a bit more skewed in his favor, but I'm trying to account for the fact that the money is worth less than it was initially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you'll have to do better than that if you want to end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. I'm starting to feel like I'm being squeezed out of the deal.

I'm not sure I want to give Bob a 30/70 split, especially considering he's not budging. I think I'll try to negotiate a bit more, but I'll also consider the fact that the game might not end soon if I don't accept this offer.

However, I'm not ready to give in yet. I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I need to be more aggressive in my offer to account for the devaluation of the money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2800,
  ""bob_gain"": 7200,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give you the whole pie, but I'm willing to compromise to end this game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 28/72 split, which is a bit more skewed in his favor, but I'm trying to account for the fact that the money is worth significantly less than it was initially. I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve more. This is my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains, and I'm starting to feel like I'm in a tough spot. I'm not sure I want to give Bob a 25/75 split, especially considering he's been rejecting my previous offers.

However, I also don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially losing even more value due to inflation. I think I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
