"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us going!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, which is a 4:1 ratio. I'm starting with a generous offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's better than risking losing money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain would be $72 ($80 x 0.9) if I were to accept the offer. However, Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, which would give me $50.

I'm not sure if I should take the guaranteed $50 or try to negotiate for more. Since the money is worth less in the next round, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less in each round, and it's now worth 90% of its original value, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal considering the inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be reasonable here.  I'm willing to give you a bigger share than before, but it's getting risky to keep going. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 72.9% of its original value. If I were to accept the offer, I'd get $40, which is a good deal considering the reduced value of the money.

However, I'm not sure if I should take the offer or try to negotiate for more. Since the money is worth less in the next round, I'll decide to...
