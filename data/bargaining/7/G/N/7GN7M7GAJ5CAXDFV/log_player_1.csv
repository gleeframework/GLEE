"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can take the smaller share this time, but I'll be more generous later 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll need to consider the value of the $3,000 I'll get in this round. With inflation, it's actually worth $2,850 to me.

On the other hand, Bob's gain of $7,000 is worth $5,600 to him, considering the 20% decrease in value.

I'm not thrilled about taking the smaller share, but I'm also not sure if I can do better in the next round. I'll decide to...
