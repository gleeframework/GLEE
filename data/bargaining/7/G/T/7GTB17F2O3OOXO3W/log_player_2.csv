Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share.  60/40 is a good balance between fairness and my need to cover potential inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
