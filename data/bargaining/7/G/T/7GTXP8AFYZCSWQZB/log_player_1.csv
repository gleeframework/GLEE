Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob agrees to this deal!  I'm going for a big chunk of the money since I know his money is worth less than mine after each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less than in the previous round, Bob's offer is still significantly more than I would get if we continue to the next round and my share keeps decreasing. It's also not worth risking another round to try and negotiate a better deal."
