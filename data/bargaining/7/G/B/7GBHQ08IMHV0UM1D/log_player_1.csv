I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting our negotiations!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not give up 80% of the money, especially with the value of the money decreasing over time. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.
