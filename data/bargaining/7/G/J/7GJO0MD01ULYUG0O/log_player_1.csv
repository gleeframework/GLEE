"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time. I think 60/40 is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $900,000 is still worth $900,000, but Bob's $100,000 is now worth $90,000. So, Bob's offer of $600,000 is actually worth $540,000 to me.

I'm not sure I like this offer. I think I can do better than a 40% gain. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my $900,000 is now worth $810,000, and Bob's share is worth $90,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 70-30""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a bigger share."
