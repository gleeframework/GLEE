"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  Since the money inflates for you, Bob, it's in your best interest to accept this offer now, as the next round will be worth less to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm proposing an 8000/2000 split in my favor. Since you rejected my offer in the previous round, I'm reducing my share but still keeping the majority. The inflation will make this offer less attractive for you in the next round, so it's in your best interest to accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money I gain. If I reject this offer, the next round's value will be even lower, but I have a chance to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 6000/4000 split in my favor.  With inflation taking a significant toll on my gains, I'm willing to give up more of my share.  However, I believe this offer is still fair, considering the diminishing value of the money for me.  I think it's in your best interest to accept this offer, Bob, as the next round will be even less profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money I gain, this offer is still better than what I would get in the next round, which would be even less valuable.  I need to accept this offer to avoid losing even more."
