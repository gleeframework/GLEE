"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effects, my gain of $40 is now worth 20% less, so it's equivalent to $32. Bob's gain of $60 is worth 5% less, so it's equivalent to $57.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
