# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n### I will accept Bob's offer of a 70/30 split. Since the money I gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round, I would only get approximately $6.30 if I were to gain the full $100. Given this, accepting $30 (which is approximately $6.30 after inflation) is a reasonable decision, as the potential gain from further negotiation is minimal. Additionally, there is a risk that if we don't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds, we will both get nothing. Therefore, accepting this offer ensures that I get some amount of money, even if it's not as much as I initially wanted."
