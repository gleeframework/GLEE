"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and Bob will be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, let's start with a fair split, but I'm not sure if you're willing to give me my fair share. I'll try to negotiate a bit. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculation. With the inflation, my gain of $50 is equivalent to $55 in the first round's value. This is a bit less than I was initially offering, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to push for more, considering Bob's message seems reasonable.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
