"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly, it's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'm not sure if I want to split it evenly, but I don't want to reject the offer without considering it. I'll accept Bob's offer this time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
