Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept!"

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth less than before. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the offer is not as favorable as my initial one, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my proposal for round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not getting my hopes up!"

# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger toll, my gain is worth even less. Considering Bob's offer is still not as favorable as my initial one, I'll think carefully about this one. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and having even less value for my share.
