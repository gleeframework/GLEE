"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's round one, and Bob is going to be greedy and see if he can get a better deal. He knows Alice's offer is only worth 80% of the original value to her, so she's likely willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. This is a fair offer, and it accounts for the inflation.  Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Bob is losing money faster than Alice.  While this offer is worse for him than his proposal, it's still a significant amount of money. It's worth taking it before he loses even more to inflation."
