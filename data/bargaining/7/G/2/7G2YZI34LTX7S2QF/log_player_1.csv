"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to propose a very unequal split, but since the money loses value more quickly for Bob, I think this might be enough to convince him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although it's not ideal, I'm accepting this offer. The money is losing value quickly for Bob, so I'm unlikely to get a better deal later on."
