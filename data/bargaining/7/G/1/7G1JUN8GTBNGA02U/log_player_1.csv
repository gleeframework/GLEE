I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite generous, considering the inflation. I'd rather take the guaranteed 75% now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
