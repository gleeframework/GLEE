I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a larger share, hoping to get the game over quickly.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though I'm losing 5% of the value of my share due to inflation, I can still do better in the next round. I'll make a counter-proposal that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. Since I'm losing value due to inflation, I'm aiming for a compromise to end the game quickly.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
