Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly greedy opening move, aiming for 90% of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's a loss from my initial proposal, I'm gaining 75% of the money, which is better than nothing.  Given the inflation, it's wise to take a good deal when it's offered."
