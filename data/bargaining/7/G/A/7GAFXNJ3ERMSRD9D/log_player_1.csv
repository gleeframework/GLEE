Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice decides to reject Bob's offer, considering that accepting 40% of the money, which is now worth 10% less due to inflation, is not favorable.
