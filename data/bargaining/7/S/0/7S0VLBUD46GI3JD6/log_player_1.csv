"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair offer to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a better offer, now it's your turn to make a better one! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, my effective gain would be $4,750 (5000 x 0.95).

Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so his effective gain would be $4,800 (6000 x 0.8).

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm also aware that I need to make a better offer to win the game. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll try to make a more competitive offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal this time!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more uneven split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. I'm trying to make a more competitive offer to counter Bob's previous proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, don't you think it's time to make a fair deal? 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the reduced value of the money, my effective gain would be $3,420 (4500 x 0.8554).

Bob's effective gain would be $6,050 (6500 x 0.552).

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm also aware that I need to make a decision quickly. I've been trying to make competitive offers, but Bob seems to be holding out for a better deal.

I'll think carefully about this offer... Ah, I'll accept it.
