"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good chunk of money. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is tempting, but Bob knows he can likely get a better deal. There are many rounds left, and the inflation rate is significantly higher for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, Alice. We both get a good amount, and it accounts for the inflation we'll both experience in future rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. My offer is still generous considering the inflation, and it's better than what you'll get if we drag this on. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob remembers the inflation rates. While Alice's offer is a little better than the previous round, Bob knows he can likely secure a larger share in the later rounds if he continues to reject."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm confident we can both get a better deal if we keep negotiating. Let's not rush this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before inflation eats away at both our shares even more. It's a fair deal! 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to what Bob wants, but he's still convinced he can get a better deal. With each passing round, Alice is losing a much larger percentage of the potential earnings due to inflation. Bob knows he can leverage this to his advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the end of this game. My offer is fair, and it's better than waiting and seeing your share shrink even further. Let's settle this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  We're running out of time and inflation is killing us both. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting more tempting, but Bob is aware of the significant inflation Alice is facing. He believes he can still secure a more favorable deal in the next round. With the inflation rate so high for Alice, her offer will likely decrease further, making his position stronger."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  With only a few rounds left, the pressure of inflation is growing. I'm confident this is the best deal we can both get before the money becomes essentially worthless.""}
