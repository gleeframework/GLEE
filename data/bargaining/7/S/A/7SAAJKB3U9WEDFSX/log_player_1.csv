"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 45 dollars and keeping 55 dollars for myself. The message ""Let's make a fair deal!"" is to convey that the offer is reasonable and close to an equal split, considering the inflation factor that affects Bob more. This way, Bob might be inclined to accept the offer early on to minimize his losses due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nNow, it's Bob's turn. Please proceed with his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair deal. How about we switch amounts from the previous round? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, and considering Bob's offer gives me less than what I initially proposed, it makes sense for me to reject this offer. The inflation factor hasn't affected me yet, so I can afford to wait for a potentially better deal in the next round or propose one that benefits me more. Additionally, accepting this offer would mean I'm agreeing to a deal that is less favorable than what I initially thought was fair, without any added incentive.\n\n###\n\nNow, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal for round 3.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair.""}\n\nIn this proposal, I'm taking into account the inflation factor that's affecting Bob. Given that the money is worth 5% less for him in each round, offering him 42 dollars now is somewhat equivalent to offering him around 44 dollars in the first round, considering the loss in value. This way, I'm still aiming for a slightly better deal for myself but acknowledging the impact of inflation on Bob's gains.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with Bob's response."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nAs previously decided, I'll send the offer that was determined before:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair.""}\n\nThis offer and message reflect the considerations made about the impact of inflation on Bob's gains and my aim for a slightly better deal for myself, while still being somewhat comparable in value to the initial offer when accounting for the loss in value due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing with each round. Let's end this with a truly fair 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven that the money's value for me remains unchanged throughout the rounds and considering Bob's offer of a 50/50 split, it seems reasonable to accept this deal. The decreasing value for Bob due to inflation doesn't affect my gain, and a 50/50 split aligns with the initial aim for a fair deal. Continuing the game could lead to further proposals that might not be as favorable, especially since Bob is becoming increasingly affected by inflation and might become more conservative in his offers. Accepting now ensures a predictable and fair outcome for both parties.\n\n###\n\nThis concludes the game with a mutual agreement on a 50/50 split."
