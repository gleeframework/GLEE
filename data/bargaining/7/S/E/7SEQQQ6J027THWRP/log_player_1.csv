"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 900,000 and giving Bob 100,000.  It's a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than nothing, it's still a significant loss from my initial proposal. I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor is impacting Bob's gains more than mine.  I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but I'm still aiming for a majority share to reflect my higher bargaining power due to inflation impacting Bob more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hurting me significantly, I'm not yet ready to accept such a large reduction in my share. I'm hoping for a better offer in the next round as Bob's bargaining power is also decreasing due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but still holding on to a majority.  The inflation is really starting to bite, but I think I can still get a better deal than Bob's last offer."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is seriously affecting my share, I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal.  Bob's offer is getting close to a point where it would be better to accept, but I'll try one more round of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
