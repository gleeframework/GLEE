"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 60%, you get 40%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair starting point, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  I'm offering 5500 for myself and 4500 for you.  Let's work together to get the most we can before the money starts shrinking too fast!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both lose money each round, so let's maximize what we can get now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, the inflation is becoming a real concern, and a 50/50 split ensures we both get something significant before the value diminishes further."
