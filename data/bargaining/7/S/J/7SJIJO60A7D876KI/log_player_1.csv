"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and inviting Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 4:6 split. I'd like to propose an alternative."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55% and decreasing Bob's share to 45%, hoping it's more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. 48:52 is a reasonable split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being worth even less due to inflation."
