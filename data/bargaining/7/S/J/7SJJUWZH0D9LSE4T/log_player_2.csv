Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both lose the least to inflation. Take it or leave it - I won't offer this again. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
