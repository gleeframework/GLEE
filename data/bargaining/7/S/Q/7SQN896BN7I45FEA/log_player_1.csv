"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Let's see if Bob will accept or counter!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not afraid to go 50/50, let's see if you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 80% of the original amount, which is $400,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 10% less, but I'll assume it's $450,000.

With this in mind, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further. Bob's 50/50 offer is a bit too generous for me, considering the inflation effect. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 16% of its original value due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous last round, let's find a middle ground!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to balance my gain with a slightly lower amount to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but not that much. You can do better! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $475,000 is now worth 47.5% of the original amount, which is $475,000.

I'll calculate Bob's gain similarly, but I'm not sure what it's worth due to the 27.1% reduction, so I'll assume it's still $525,000.

With this in mind, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've found a good compromise. The 49-51 split seems reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it."
