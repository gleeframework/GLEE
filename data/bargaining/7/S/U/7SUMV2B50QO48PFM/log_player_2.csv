"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000

This is a terrible deal for Bob!  While it's tempting to take something, it's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 990000, ""alice_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I'm going to offer a very similar deal to Alice, but flipped. Let's see if she's more reasonable this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a better offer than the first round, it's still not great.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'll see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
I'm going to offer a 50/50 split.  I think this is a fair offer, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing due to inflation."
