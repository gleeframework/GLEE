I propose a 990,000 to 10,000 split in my favor. I figure I should get the lion's share since I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty insulting. He's essentially flipping our original offer and taking 99% of the money.  While I'd love to have 10,000,  I'd rather take my chances and see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'll offer 900,000 for myself and 100,000 for Bob.  I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation. Let's see if he's more receptive this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much better than the previous one, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  Even with a 14.26% loss in value, 500,000 is a decent amount. I'll take it."
