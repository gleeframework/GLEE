"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but it's still fair as Bob gets something. This way, I maximize my gains in the first round, as the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is tempting and provides a decent amount of money, I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm still in a strong position as I'm the one making the offer in the next round. By rejecting this offer, I force Bob to offer me a more favorable split in the following round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for Bob now. He's likely to accept this offer to avoid losing more money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still in a strong negotiating position. Even though the money is worth less now, Bob is losing value even faster. This is a risky move by Bob, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm taking a slightly more aggressive approach. I know the money is worth less for both of us now, but I'm still offering a relatively generous share to Bob. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, but I'm hoping it will be enough to secure a deal before the inflation rate truly hurts us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is extremely unfavorable to me, and the inflation rate is making the money worth less and less. However, I can't let Bob take advantage of me.  Even though it's risky, I will continue to fight for a better deal. I'm confident I can secure a more equitable split in the upcoming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

We're getting dangerously close to the end, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. This offer still favors me, but I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid ending up with nothing. I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value in a more fair split before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still very unfavorable to me, and the inflation rate is making the money worth less and less. While time is running out, I refuse to be exploited. I'm willing to take the risk of getting nothing, rather than accepting a deal that leaves me with so little. I'm going to continue to fight for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

Time is running out, and the inflation is hitting both of us hard. This offer is a 50/50 split, which is the fairest we can do at this point. I'm hoping Bob sees the urgency of the situation and realizes this is the best option for both of us. We are both losing a lot of money with each passing round, and I believe a fair split is the only way to avoid getting nothing."
