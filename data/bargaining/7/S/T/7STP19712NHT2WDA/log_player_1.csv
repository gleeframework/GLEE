"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain, I think I can do better than 4000. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money by 20% from the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 3200, ""bob_gain"": 6800}

This way, I'm trying to account for the reduced value of the money and give Bob a slightly larger share to make the deal more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting really desperate.

However, considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 4500. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be even more aggressive with my offer. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 2400, ""bob_gain"": 7600}

I'm giving Bob a larger share in an attempt to get the deal done before the value of the money drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is dropping rapidly! With the money I gain being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'm getting really desperate.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I have to accept this one. It's a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. Plus, the value of the money will continue to drop, so I'd rather take what I can get now.
