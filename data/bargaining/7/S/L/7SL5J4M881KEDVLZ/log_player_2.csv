Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you, my offer is still generous 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, I'm being kind by not dropping my offer more 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a tough game, but I need to hold my ground. While the inflation hurts, accepting an offer this low would set a bad precedent. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, even with the time pressure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 495000,
""alice_gain"": 505000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm making a final offer.  This is a slight advantage for you, but it's the best I can do considering the lost value. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time for a strong stance.  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice.  She's clearly aiming for a larger share, but this offer is still within a reasonable range, and it avoids a protracted negotiation where I lose even more to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not impressed. The clock is ticking 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation, but I'm not giving in. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the money due to her tactics and inflation. I need to show I'm serious about walking away if she doesn't negotiate fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Alice, this isn't a game anymore. We both lose if we don't settle this now. I'm taking a significant hit from the inflation, this is the most I can offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Time to turn up the heat.  Alice needs to understand the seriousness of the situation. I'm emphasizing the potential loss for both of us if we fail to reach an agreement.  My offer leans slightly more in her favor, but it's a necessary concession to avoid getting nothing at all.  This close to the deadline, it's a gamble worth taking."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up that much. Time is on my side 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is agonizingly close to my last offer, and with only three rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing is very real.  Alice clearly has the upper hand due to the inflation mechanic, and while accepting this offer means losing a significant chunk of the potential gain, it's the most logical choice in this pressured situation.  Better to take a smaller share than risk getting nothing at all."
