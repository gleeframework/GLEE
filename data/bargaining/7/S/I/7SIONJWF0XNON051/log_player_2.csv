Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to a more ""fair"" split, it's still tilted in her favor. Given the inflation, we need to push for a better deal sooner rather than later, or we risk getting even less as time goes on."
