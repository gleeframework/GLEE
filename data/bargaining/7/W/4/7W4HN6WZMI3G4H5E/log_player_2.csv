"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I propose a 50/50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60/40 is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made my proposal, taking into account the 5% decrease in value for me. Now it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give a bit more ground, but I still think a 55/45 split is fairer considering the inflation affecting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer since I believe I can negotiate a better deal, considering the inflation affects me more with each passing round. It's my turn to make another proposal.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'd like to correct Alice's assumption - the inflation only affects me, not her.\n\n###\n\nLet's continue the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Given the increasing inflation impact on me, I think 58/42 is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made my revised proposal, factoring in the additional decrease in value for my share. Now it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
