"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40. We can adjust later if needed. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject the offer.  It's a good starting point, but I think I can do better, especially since the money is worth less to Alice in each round.  Let's see if I can get a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need a little more to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split.  Inflation is biting, but I'm willing to meet halfway.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  While I would have liked a bit more, the inflation is becoming a serious factor.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
