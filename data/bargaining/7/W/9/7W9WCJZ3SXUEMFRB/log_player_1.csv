"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This is my first offer. I'm taking the majority of the money, leaving Bob with a very small amount.  I figure,  he'll likely reject this, but it establishes my position as someone willing to be aggressive in this negotiation. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm not going to accept a mere $1,  especially when I know the money will be worth less in the next round. Let's see what happens when I get to make the offer again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still keeping the lion's share for myself. The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to start making concessions if I want to secure a decent payout."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the situation, and I'm not going to let him. Even with the inflation, I can still do better than this. I'm rejecting his offer and hoping to get a more fair deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm making another concession, but I'm still holding out for a significant portion of the money.  The inflation is starting to make a real difference, and I need to be more flexible if I want to close this deal. Let's see if Bob is finally ready to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, I've realized the inflation is rapidly diminishing the value of the money.  Accepting this will at least give me a decent amount, even if it's a lot less than I originally hoped for. It's better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
