6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to end this quickly. It's better to take a decent share now than risk losing more with inflation.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,I think 55/45 is more than fair considering the inflation hits you harder.,Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. My turn, and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  I propose 55/45 in my favor. This is your best chance to get anything above half before inflation makes it even less appealing for you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4250.0,5750.0,"Inflation is taking its toll on your share, and I'm not feeling generous. My turn, my terms. Take it or wait for further decrease in value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Bob, I understand you're trying to maximize your gain, but this is getting ridiculous. The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. My final offer is 52.5/47.5 - take it before inflation eats away even more of our potential profits.",Alice,5,
