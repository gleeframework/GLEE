60.0,40.0,"Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40. We can negotiate further if you'd like.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think it's fairer if we split it more evenly. How about 55 for me and 45 for you?  Let's avoid going back and forth and make a deal.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's just split it down the middle.  We're losing money with each round and I don't think either of us will get a better offer.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
