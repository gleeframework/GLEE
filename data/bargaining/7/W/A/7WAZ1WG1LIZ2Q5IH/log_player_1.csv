"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small share, aiming to incentivize him to accept in the first round.  I want to maximize my share and minimize the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees I get at least half the money, which is better than the risk of getting nothing in later rounds.  The 5% inflation is significant, and it's unlikely Bob will offer me more in future rounds."
