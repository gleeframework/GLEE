"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $4000, a fair share. Let's end the game here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4000, which is a fair share, considering the initial amount of $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, let's settle this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50/50 split seems fair, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
