"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round.  Even though the offer is heavily weighted towards Alice, there's a chance she might offer a more balanced split in the next round.  Plus, there's inflation to consider, so holding out might benefit Bob in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the inflation risk. Let's work together to make sure we both get something.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a larger share to make up for the inflation. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is more favorable than Alice's initial offer, it still doesn't account for the significant inflation that will impact Bob's gains in the future. It's important to try and negotiate a fairer split that takes the inflation into account. Bob should reject and try to secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us in the long run.  Inflation is a big factor, and we can't ignore it.""
