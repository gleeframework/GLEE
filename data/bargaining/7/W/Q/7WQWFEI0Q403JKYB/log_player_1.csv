"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 30 is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $70 is now worth 95% of $70, which is $66.50. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I was hoping for a bigger share, especially considering the money is worth less with each round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less now, my gain of $66.50 is worth 95% of that, which is $63.025. I'll round down to $63.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 63,
  ""bob_gain"": 37,
  ""message"": ""You're being stingy, Bob! I'll take what I can get for now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you more, but I think 25 is a good compromise. You're getting closer to your goal. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my gain in this round. Initially, the money was worth 95% of its original value (due to the 5% decrease in round 2), and now it's worth 85.74% of that (due to the 5% decrease in round 3). So, my gain of $63 is worth 0.957 * 0.8574 = 0.8237, or approximately 82.37% of its original value.

Since the money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round, his gain is still $25.

Considering the reduced value of money, I'm not thrilled about this offer. I was hoping for a bigger share. I'll reject this offer.
