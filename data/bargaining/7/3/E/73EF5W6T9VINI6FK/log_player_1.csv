Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair offer, as I'm taking the risk of being the first to propose and I'm only keeping 90% of the money.  This should incentivize Bob to accept and we can both get a fair share.  Let's get this game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
