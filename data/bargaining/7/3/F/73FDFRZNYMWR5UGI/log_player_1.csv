"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split in my favor, with me getting 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob getting 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a better split, I'll give you a good chunk! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $300,000 is worth 80% of the original $300,000, which is $240,000.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal here. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so my gain of $300,000 is now worth 64% of the original, which is $192,000. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50!""
}
