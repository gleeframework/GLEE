"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can always adjust in the next rounds if you think it's unfair. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a bit low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like a higher share initially.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair to start. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's go with 70/30.  If we keep going back and forth, we'll both lose a lot of money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher percentage,  it's better to take what's offered than risk losing more to inflation."
