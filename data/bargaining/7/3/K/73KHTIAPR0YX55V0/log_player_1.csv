"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob wants to take a smaller share to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1000, I'd rather see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'm hoping he'll realize that the money is quickly losing value and might be willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion.  I'm hoping that Bob will start to see that the risk of waiting is increasing with every round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  It's a bit tempting to take the $2000, but the money is losing value so quickly that I'm confident I can do better if I hold out.  I think Bob will start to feel the pressure of the dwindling value and might be more willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm continuing to decrease my share, but I'm still holding onto the majority of the money. The inflation is starting to get serious, and I believe Bob will start to see the value of accepting a deal rather than risking nothing."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. The money is losing value rapidly, but I'm holding out for a better deal. I think the pressure of the dwindling value will finally make Bob reconsider his position and accept a more balanced division in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm continuing to decrease my share, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion. The inflation is now very serious, and I believe Bob will realize that accepting a reasonable offer is better than risking getting nothing at all."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm finally proposing an even split. The inflation is crippling, and I'm concerned we'll both get nothing if we keep playing. It's time to be practical and compromise."
