"Round 1

```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to this and we can move on to the next round."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable request. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 47, you can have 53""

I'm suggesting a 47-53 split, which is still close to 50-50 but slightly favors me."
