"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a better deal for me, but I think it's still fair. Let's finish this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a slightly better share than your last offer. Let's split it 55/45 this time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep negotiating, the inflation is hitting hard.  A 4500 gain is better than nothing, especially since my next offer is likely to be rejected and leave me with even less."
