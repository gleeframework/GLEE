"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm keeping most of the money for myself. Let's see if he accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to accept a smaller amount to get the same value as before. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
