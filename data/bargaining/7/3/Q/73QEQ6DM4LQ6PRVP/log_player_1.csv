"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair, considering the inflation factor.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a smaller amount now than risk getting even less in future rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer.
