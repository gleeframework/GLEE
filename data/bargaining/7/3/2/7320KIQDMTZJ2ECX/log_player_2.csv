"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This is a better offer than your last. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out! This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is experiencing a 59.04% reduction in value. Waiting any longer will drastically reduce his potential gain.
* **Alice's Final Offer:** Alice is unlikely to offer a better deal at this stage. Her offer is consistent with her previous offers and likely her bottom line.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a high chance he'll end up with nothing in a potential Round 6. 

While $400,000 is significantly less than his initial goals, taking the deal now minimizes his losses due to the brutal inflation rate."
