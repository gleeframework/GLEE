**Reasoning:**

Even though the inflation is hitting hard, accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than half the pot.  Alice knows the pressure is on, but I need to hold out for a better deal. There's still a chance she'll offer something more reasonable as the rounds progress and she realizes I'm not giving in easily."
