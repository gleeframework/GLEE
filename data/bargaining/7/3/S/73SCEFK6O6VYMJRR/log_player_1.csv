"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take $55 and give Bob $45, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}


I'm offering to take $52 and give Bob $48, with a message suggesting that we meet in the middle and compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here. Note that due to inflation, my gain of $52 is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round, but I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable solution."
