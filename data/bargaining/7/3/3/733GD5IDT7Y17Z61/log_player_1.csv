"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20%, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered 20, I'm starting with 30. Will you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less now, so I need to adjust my gain accordingly.

Since Bob is offering 30, which is 50% of the remaining 100 (after my initial 80), I'll try to meet him in the middle.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'd like to offer 35 instead of 30.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll adjust my gain accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 63.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 36.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 63.5 is a fair share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said 63.5 is fair, but I think I'm being generous with 45. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation, my gain is worth much less now. Since Bob is offering 45, which is a significant increase from his previous offer, I'll try to meet him in the middle.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I accept your offer of 45. It's a fair compromise.""
}
```"
