I'm not happy with this offer. Bob is only offering me $3,000, which is a significant decrease from the $5,000 I initially proposed. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."

I'm getting a bit worried about the inflation and the limited number of rounds left, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $3500. I was hoping for a better deal, and I'm not going to settle for this. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."
