Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it seems like we both want a better deal. I understand the inflation is working against you, so how about we meet in the middle? 55/45 seems fair. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
