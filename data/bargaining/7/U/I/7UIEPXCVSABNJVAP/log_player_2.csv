"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This might seem like a generous offer considering the first round, but remember, the value of money decreases by 5% in each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but the value of money is still decreasing. I think we can do better than this, but it's a good starting point.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a new division where the ratio is closer to equal, 5:5. This might not seem ideal at first glance, but given the inflation, it's a balanced approach. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us equally over the course of the remaining rounds. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
