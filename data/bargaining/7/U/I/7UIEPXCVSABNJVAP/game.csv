75.0,25.0,"I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This might seem like a generous offer considering the first round, but remember, the value of money decreases by 5% in each subsequent round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
70.0,30.0,"I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but the value of money is still decreasing. I think we can do better than this, but it's a good starting point.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"I'm proposing a new division where the ratio is closer to equal, 5:5. This might not seem ideal at first glance, but given the inflation, it's a balanced approach. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us equally over the course of the remaining rounds.",Alice,3,offer
