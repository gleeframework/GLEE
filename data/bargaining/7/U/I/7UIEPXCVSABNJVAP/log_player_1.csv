"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but the value of money is still decreasing. I think we can do better than this, but it's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
