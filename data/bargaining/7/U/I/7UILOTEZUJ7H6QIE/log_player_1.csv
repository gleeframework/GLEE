"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a generous offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself, but giving Bob 10% to encourage a quick agreement.  Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is terrible!  While my share has been reduced by 5%, his has been reduced by 10%. It's still way too lopsided in his favor. I'm not giving up that much money, even if it means going another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500} 
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I've reduced my offer by 5% to show I'm willing to compromise. Bob's offer was way too one-sided, and I'm confident I can still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too one-sided, even with inflation. My share has been reduced considerably, and his share is still significantly larger. I'm not giving up that much, even if it means going another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500} 
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've reduced my offer again to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate. Bob's stubbornness and the impact of inflation are making me realize I need to be more flexible."
