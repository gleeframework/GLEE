Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We both lose money with each round, so a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
