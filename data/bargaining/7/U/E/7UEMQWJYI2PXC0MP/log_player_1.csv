Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a very unequal split, but that's because of the inflation.  I want to secure the most I can in the first round, before the money loses too much value.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and while I would have preferred to get more, the inflation risk is too high. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
