"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 seems reasonable.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can do better for both of us.  I'd propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as the value of the money is declining for me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to flip the script and get the larger share, huh?

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give him a 60-40 split in his favor just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split in his favor, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. 55-45 seems like a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
