Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn Alice. How about this slightly more balanced offer? It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at it. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is worse for me than before, and the inflation hurts Bob more than me. I'll take my chances in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  Every round is costing us both money! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is finally feeling the pressure of the inflation, even if it's a bit slower than I would have liked. This offer is better than I could reasonably expect in later rounds.
