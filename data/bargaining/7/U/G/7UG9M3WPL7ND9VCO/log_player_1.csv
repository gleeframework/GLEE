"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide what to do!"

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not good enough, I want a fairer split!""
}
```

I'm rejecting his offer because I think 60/40 is still not a fair split, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
