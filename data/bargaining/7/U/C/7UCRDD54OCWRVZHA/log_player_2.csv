"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's better to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll wait to see what she proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point.  It acknowledges your initial proposal but is more equitable for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least 60% to make this worth it for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, 400,000 is not a good enough deal.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Alice in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""We're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's split the difference at 50/50.  It's the most equitable option for both of us at this point.""}
