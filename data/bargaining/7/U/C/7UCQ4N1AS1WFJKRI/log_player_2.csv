I'm going to try to get a better deal!  I'll see if I can get a closer split in my favor."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's getting risky.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 50/50 is the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll take the 50/50 split.  The inflation is getting too risky and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal."
