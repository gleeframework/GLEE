"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'm reasonable""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm trying to be reasonable and split it fairly, but I'm also trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I'm proposing 55/45.  Let's be fair and efficient. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since my money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'm not as attached to the original proposal.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
