"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll consider the actual amounts as follows:
My gain: 50 / 0.95 = 52.63
Bob's gain: 50 / 0.8 = 62.5

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me again, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation effect:

My gain: 45 / 0.8586 = 52.36
Bob's gain: 55 / 0.5184 = 106.05

This is not a good deal for me, as I would be giving up a significant amount of value. I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, which is now 14.26% less for me, I'll make a new offer.

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}"
