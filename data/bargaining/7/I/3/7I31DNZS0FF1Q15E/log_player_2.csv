{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but my turn now.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This ensures we both benefit before inflation diminishes the value.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The longer this goes, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for you. I propose a 50/50 split to end this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
