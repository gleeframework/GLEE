Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  While it's a big difference, I think it's a fair starting point considering the inflation risk. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes accepting this offer the best choice. I'm getting half the money, and it's guaranteed.  It's a much better outcome than risking another round and getting a worse deal due to inflation."
