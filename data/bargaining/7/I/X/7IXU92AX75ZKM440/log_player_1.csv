"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since this is the first round, I want to secure a large portion of the money, but I'm also leaving a decent share for Bob to hopefully incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. I'm willing to give up some of my potential gains to ensure we reach an agreement before the next round, as the value of the money will continue to decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm getting a much smaller share than I'd hoped for, the value of the money has significantly decreased.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's likely I'll get nothing if I reject and the game continues."
