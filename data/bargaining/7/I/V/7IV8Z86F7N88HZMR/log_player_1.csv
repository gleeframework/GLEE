"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation factor.  It still gives you a significant advantage, and we can get this done before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
