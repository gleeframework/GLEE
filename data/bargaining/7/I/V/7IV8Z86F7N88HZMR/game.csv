45.0,55.0,"I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation factor.  It still gives you a significant advantage, and we can get this done before the money loses too much value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your point about the inflation, but your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing 55/45, which is a middle ground between our previous offers.",Alice,3,
