Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation more than Bob. While her offers are getting slightly better, they are still heavily skewed in her favor. Bob needs to hold strong and continue to push for a more equitable split, knowing that time is on his side."
