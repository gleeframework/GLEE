"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a very aggressive strategy, but it's the best way to maximize my potential gains in the early rounds. If Bob rejects this, he knows he'll have to make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While he is now offering a very favorable deal for himself, I believe I can do better. I will propose a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable offer, and I believe it's the best way to ensure we both get a significant share of the money."
