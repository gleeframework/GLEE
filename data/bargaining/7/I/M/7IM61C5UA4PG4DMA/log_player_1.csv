"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting my potential gains.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split just yet. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 58/42 seems fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 58/42 split, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
