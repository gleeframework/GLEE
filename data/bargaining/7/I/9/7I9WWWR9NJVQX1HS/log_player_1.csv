"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still want to aim for a more balanced split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but 60% is still too low for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation and the previous rejections. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll have to be careful with my next move. I'm not thrilled about the 20% share, but I don't want to reject again and risk getting an even worse deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take it, but I'm not happy about it. I hope we can do better next time.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we can negotiate a better deal in the future."
