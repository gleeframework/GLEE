"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and giving Bob $40, with a message that tries to persuade him to accept this division as a fair one. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I'll be slightly more generous to myself this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round. The inflation isn't too bad for me yet, so I'm willing to take the risk and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Come on, I'm being reasonable here""
}


I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive in my offer, while still being somewhat reasonable. I'm taking into account that the money is worth less to both of us now, but I'm hoping Bob will want to end the game before it's worth even less. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable. The money is worth significantly less to both of us now, and splitting it evenly seems like a fair way to end the game before we both lose even more value. I'll accept Bob's offer and we can call it a day!"
