"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a bit more this time.  Let's split it 6000 for me and 4000 for you.  It's still a fair deal considering the money is losing value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
