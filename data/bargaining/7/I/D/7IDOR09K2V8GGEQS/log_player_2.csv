Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still in my best interest to hold out a bit longer.  The inflation is hurting her more than me, and I'm betting she'll become more willing to accept a less favorable deal as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to propose a strong offer. An even split is fair and gives Alice a substantial amount, especially considering the increasing inflation. This might be the turning point where she'll be more motivated to accept rather than risk losing more value."
