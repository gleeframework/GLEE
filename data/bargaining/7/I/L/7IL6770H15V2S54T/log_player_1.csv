Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'm taking a large share, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious concern.  It's better to take the 5000 now and guarantee some money than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
