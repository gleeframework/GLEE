"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try to find a better compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in the same terms as the initial proposal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, as I'd like to aim for a better split for myself. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55% and decreasing Bob's share to 45%, trying to find a better compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in the same terms as the initial proposal, but with the updated values for Bob's gain.

With the money Bob gains being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, his share is actually equivalent to 57.69% of the original amount, which is more than my current proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a fair compromise.
