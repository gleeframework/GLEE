"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, giving Bob a small portion.  I want to see how he responds to this, and hopefully end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this is a good deal. With inflation, Bob's offer is effectively worth more to him than my initial offer was to me. It's best to accept and end the game."
