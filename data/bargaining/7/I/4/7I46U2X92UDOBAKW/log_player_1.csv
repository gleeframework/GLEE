"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure it's a fair starting point, giving Bob a small share while securing most of the money for myself.  Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal.  While he's taking a hit on his earnings due to inflation, I'm not seeing any incentive to accept this drastically reduced offer. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm willing to concede a bit from my initial offer, but I still want to secure a majority share. I'm offering an 8000/2000 split. Given the inflation affecting Bob more than me, I think this is a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfavorable. While I understand inflation is impacting him more, I'm not willing to accept a 4000/6000 split when I know I can get a better deal in the next few rounds. Let's see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer to try and reach a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a larger share of the money.  I'm offering a 7000/3000 split. With inflation hitting Bob harder, I believe this is a fair proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to being more equal, it's still not satisfactory. I'm still in a strong position with inflation affecting him more than me. I'm going to hold out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm continuing to decrease my share, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  Given the increasing impact of inflation on Bob, I believe this 6500/3500 split is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally becoming more appealing. While I'm not getting a majority share anymore, the 5000/5000 split is fair given the inflation's impact on Bob.  It's better to secure a decent share now rather than risk losing everything in the remaining rounds."
