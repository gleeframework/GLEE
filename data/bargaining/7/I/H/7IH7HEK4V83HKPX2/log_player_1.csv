"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 70/30 is a more reasonable split, considering the game is just starting. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 80% of the original, so I'd be getting 48 (0.8 * 60).

I don't think 30 is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer was already 60. I'd like to reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 64% of the original (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). So, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 64,
  ""bob_gain"": 36,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split given the inflation.""
}
```

This way, I'm still getting a decent amount, but I'm leaving some room for Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly, considering the inflation is affecting us both. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is really taking a toll on me! My gain is now worth 31.2 (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.64 = 0.512, but since I'm calculating the percentage decrease from the original 60, I'm using 0.64 * 0.488 = 0.31344, rounded to 0.312, then multiplied by 100 to get 31.2).

Considering the offer, I think splitting it evenly is a reasonable compromise, especially since we're both being affected by inflation. I'll accept this offer.
