I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob.  I want to get this done quickly before the inflation hurts us both too much.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy!  I'm willing to negotiate, but his offer is way too lopsided. Let's see if he'll come back with a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a little more, but I'm still going to hold out for a larger share.  I think he's realizing that inflation is really starting to hurt, and he's going to need to compromise to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation. This offer isn't great, but it's better than waiting any longer and losing more money. I'll take it!"
