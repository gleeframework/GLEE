Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly.  I'll keep 90% and give Bob 10%.  Let's see if he's willing to accept that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, the inflation means that I'm effectively losing 20% of my share each round. Accepting now guarantees me 50%, whereas rejecting risks losing a lot more in the coming rounds."
