"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fairly generous offer to start, as I believe it's important to establish goodwill and potentially incentivize Bob to accept early on.  I'm also hoping that by starting high, I can avoid the significant devaluation of my potential gains in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low, especially considering the inflation rate. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for such a drastic shift in the balance of the split. I'm confident that I can achieve a more equitable outcome in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm dropping my offer by 100,000, but I'm still keeping the majority of the share. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also ensuring that I maintain a significant portion of the potential earnings. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers will only lead to further devaluation of the money, and he will be more inclined to accept a fair offer in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, and the inflation rate is accelerating rapidly. While I'm willing to compromise, I won't settle for an offer that leaves me with such a small share.  I believe I can still secure a much more favorable outcome by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm again reducing my offer by 100,000, but this is still a significant share for me. The inflation rate is becoming a major factor, and I need to secure a larger portion of the money before it depreciates even further. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the severity of the inflation and be more receptive to a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation rate is making it increasingly urgent to secure a larger share.  I'm not willing to accept such a significant reduction in my potential earnings, especially with so few rounds remaining.  I need to hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

With the inflation rate continuing to climb, I'm taking a more aggressive approach. I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still maintaining a significant majority of the money. The remaining rounds are critical, and I need to secure a larger portion of the potential earnings before the inflation rate makes this deal worthless. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the urgency of the situation and finally accept a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to what I'd consider acceptable, it's still not enough.  The inflation rate is reaching a critical point, and I need to ensure that I get a larger share of the money before it depreciates further. I'm willing to continue negotiating to reach a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

With only a few rounds left, the inflation is becoming a major threat. I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split, as it's the most equitable outcome considering the rapid depreciation of the money. This is a significant compromise on my part, but it's necessary to ensure we both receive some value before the money becomes worthless."
