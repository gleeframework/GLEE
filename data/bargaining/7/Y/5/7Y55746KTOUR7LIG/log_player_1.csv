"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get $600,000 and Bob will get $400,000. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to take the smaller share this round, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy last round, now it's my turn to make a better offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial greed. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up 70% of the remaining money, especially since it's worth less than before due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle this round""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor than my initial offer, but still a reasonable compromise. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to meet him halfway this round, hoping to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
