Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose if this drags on. I'm offering you 45% which is more than you'd get if I had accepted your offer in the previous round. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
