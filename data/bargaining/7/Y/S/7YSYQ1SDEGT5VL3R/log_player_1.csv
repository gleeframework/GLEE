"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a generous offer! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, and I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share this time!""
}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about Bob's offer again...

{
""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'm not thrilled about the 45/55 split, but I'm willing to accept this offer since it's still a decent compromise. I think it's better to take what I can get and move on, rather than risking another rejection and potentially ending up with even less."
