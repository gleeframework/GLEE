"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This offer ensures you get a decent share and avoids us losing value due to inflation in later rounds.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before inflation hurts us both.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous proposal wasn't fair to me.  This offer still gives you a significant portion and is much better than risking further inflation. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
