"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob in the first round, considering that with each passing round, the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob than for me. This division allows both of us to gain a substantial amount before the value drops further. The message aims to appeal to Bob's understanding of the game's mechanics and the mutual benefit of accepting the offer early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair we split the money evenly, considering the inflation will affect us both.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his message about fairness, his proposal gives him a significantly larger share ($6000) while I would only get $4000. Given the inflation rates, the value of the money decreases more for Bob than for me with each round, but his offer doesn't reflect this imbalance. I believe I can negotiate for a better split considering the game's mechanics.\n\n###"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increased loss from inflation in this round, I've adjusted my offer slightly in your favor, but I still need to compensate for the future loss I'll incur.""}\n\nIn this round, I've slightly adjusted my initial offer to give Bob a bit more, acknowledging the impact of inflation on both our potential gains. However, I've kept in mind that the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob, which means he has more to lose from further delays. My message aims to convey a sense of urgency and fairness, considering the game's progression.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still hoping we can agree to an even split.  The inflation is hurting us both, and I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's offer of an even split might seem fair at first glance, considering the significantly higher rate at which the value of his share decreases due to inflation (48.8% loss for Bob vs. 27.1% loss for me), I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. The difference in inflation rates between us creates an imbalance that a 50/50 split doesn't account for. Given this, I'm inclined to reject this offer and continue negotiating for a division that reflects the game's economic dynamics more accurately.\n\n###\n\n###"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Given the substantial impact of inflation on your potential gains, I'm willing to offer a slightly more generous split, but I must also consider my own losses. This is a compromise, taking into account the decreasing value for both of us.""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer again, slightly increasing Bob's share in recognition of the severe impact of inflation on his potential gains. However, I've also kept in mind that I'm still losing value, albeit at a lower rate than Bob. My message aims to convey a sense of compromise and urgency, highlighting the mutual losses we're incurring with each passing round.\n\n###\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is getting out of hand! Let's split it evenly, 50/50, before we both lose too much. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant loss in value for both of us, but especially for Bob, his offer of an even split at this stage is more reasonable than in previous rounds. The difference in inflation rates still exists, but the overall loss in value for both parties makes the 50/50 split a more acceptable compromise. Continuing to negotiate further could lead to diminishing returns, considering the substantial decrease in value that would occur in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer now seems to be the most pragmatic decision to ensure we both receive a meaningful amount, despite the losses incurred due to inflation.\n\n###\n\n###"
