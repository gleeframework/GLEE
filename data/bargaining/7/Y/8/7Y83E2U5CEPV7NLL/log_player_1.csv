"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is now worth even less. I'll consider Bob's offer. Since it's a 50-50 split, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
