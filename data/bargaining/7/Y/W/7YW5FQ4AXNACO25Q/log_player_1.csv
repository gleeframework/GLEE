Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to propose a split that is a bit more favorable to me, but it's still a fair deal. I'm taking into account the decreasing value of the money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, my friend, let's be realistic. The value is dropping fast! This is a strong offer considering the circumstances. Take it while you can!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the value of the money is dropping quickly. This is my final offer before we both risk losing everything. Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly, taking into account the declining value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly aggressive, and while the offer isn't terrible considering the inflation, I'm willing to gamble a bit. The value for him is dropping much faster than for me, which puts me in a stronger position as this goes on. I'll counter with a stronger offer in the next round and see if he bites."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time! This offer is a good compromise, and it ensures we both leave with something substantial. Don't let greed get the best of us!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're in a tight spot now.  I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time, but it's time to be realistic. This is my final offer - take it or we risk getting nothing! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, this is the best offer I'm likely to get at this point. Bob is clearly getting desperate, and his offer is actually worse than what he offered in Round 2. If I reject this, he's likely to get even more aggressive, and we risk getting nothing. Taking the 4000 is the safest option now, even with the significant inflation."
