"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's see if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite one-sided!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer, as I'd like to negotiate further. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing 20% again, the total amount is now worth 80% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. The message is an invitation to find a mutually acceptable solution."
