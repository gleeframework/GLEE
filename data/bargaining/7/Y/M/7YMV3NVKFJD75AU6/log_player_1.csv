"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the inflation and Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll think about the actual value I'll receive. In this round, I'd get 40 * 0.95 = 38 dollars, and Bob would get 60 * 0.95 = 57 dollars.

I'll reject the offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and my previous rejection, I'll make a new offer. I'll aim to get a bit more than 38 dollars, considering the 5% decrease in value.

{""alice_gain"": 42, ""bob_gain"": 58}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means it's worth 85.74% of the original value. So, if I get 45 dollars, I'll actually get 45 * 0.8574 = 38.55 dollars.

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to get more than 38.55 dollars. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and my previous rejections, I'll make a new offer. I'll aim to get a bit more than 38.55 dollars, considering the 14.26% decrease in value.

Since the money is worth 85.74% of the original value, I'll offer a slightly higher percentage of the original 100 dollars. I'll aim for a 43.5% share, which is a bit more than my previous offers.

{""alice_gain"": 43.5, ""bob_gain"": 56.5}"
