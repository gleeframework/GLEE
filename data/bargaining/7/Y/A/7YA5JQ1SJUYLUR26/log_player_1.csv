"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly higher percentage, but I'm not going for 50/50 yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, my gain of $8,000 is now worth $6,400 in terms of purchasing power.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'm hoping that Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the second round, my gain of $6,400 is now worth $5,120 in terms of purchasing power.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,800 and keeping $5,200 for myself, which is a relatively small concession from my previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much control over the majority of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less after the third round, my gain of $5,200 is now worth $2,688 in terms of purchasing power.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's a relatively fair split, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round. I'm also getting a bit concerned that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation."
