"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""This is a fair offer.""}\n\n###\nI offered 6000 dollars for myself and 4000 dollars for Bob. Let's see if he accepts or makes a counteroffer. Please proceed with Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This accounts for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI rejected Bob's offer. The offer of 4800 dollars for myself is too low, especially considering the relatively low impact of inflation on my gain compared to Bob's. Let's proceed to the next round where I will make a new proposal. Please let me know when to make my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a generous offer.""}\n\n###\nI've made a new offer, taking into account the effects of inflation on both our gains. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less now, and mine is only 10% less, I've adjusted the amounts accordingly. My offer of 5800 dollars for myself and 4200 dollars for Bob reflects this. Let's see how Bob responds. Please proceed with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, especially on Bob's, I've decided to accept his offer. The difference in the value of money over time has reduced the actual value we both gain, but accepting 4400 dollars now is preferable to risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. This way, we both walk away with something, accounting for the time value of money."
