"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This accounts for the time value of money.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** It's crucial to factor in the inflation. Delaying an agreement costs Bob more than Alice.
* **Stronger Position:** Since Alice proposed an unfair split in Round 1, she likely understands the game's dynamics and knows Bob is willing to reject a bad deal.
* **Not Too Greedy:**  While aiming for a larger share due to the inflation disadvantage, Bob's offer still leaves Alice with a reasonable amount, increasing the chance of acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a generous offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unfavorable:** Even accounting for inflation, Alice's offer still heavily favors her. The difference in inflation impact isn't large enough to justify accepting such a low amount.
* **Time Pressure:** While the money is losing value, Alice is likely feeling the pressure as well.  She risks getting an even worse deal if Bob gets to propose in Round 4.
* **Holding Strong:** Rejecting this offer signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a fair share and won't be pressured into a bad deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:** This offer considers the substantial inflation both players have experienced.
* **Finality:**  By presenting it as a ""final offer,"" Bob creates a sense of urgency. This might prompt Alice to accept rather than risk the money losing even more value.
* **Strategic Retreat (Slightly):**  While still favoring Bob, it's a slight retreat from his Round 2 offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate, potentially making it more palatable to Alice."
