This is getting ridiculous!  I'm not going to accept such a low offer.  It's clear Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll keep rejecting until we reach a fairer agreement."

Round 10

{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm offering 900,000 for myself and 100,000 for Alice.  I'm making a big concession here to try and avoid getting nothing.  We're down to the wire and inflation is making my side of the deal drastically worse.  This is my final offer."

This is beyond ridiculous! I'm not accepting a measly $1000.  Alice's greed is driving us both to ruin.  We're both going to get nothing if we don't come to a fair agreement."

This is it. This is my final offer, and it's a complete reversal of the situation. I'm taking almost everything because I'm losing so much due to inflation.  Alice needs to accept this to avoid getting nothing at all."
