"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, but let's switch the roles this time. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as you suggested before. Let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're trying to flip the script, Bob, but I'm not buying it. I'd rather wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and choosing to proceed to the next round. I'm not convinced that a 60-40 split in Bob's favor is a good deal, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Due to inflation, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a more balanced split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 54-46 split in my favor, with me getting $540,000 and Bob getting $460,000. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob is willing to accept a more balanced split."
