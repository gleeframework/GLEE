"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40, and I'll take 60. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The current offer gives me 40, but I think I can negotiate for more. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I'll have to be strategic about when to accept an offer. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's try to find a better balance. I think 55-45 is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time. I think a 50/50 split is fair, especially given how quickly inflation is working against us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the rapid inflation, where the money I gain is now worth 36% less than in the first round, I believe this is a fair deal. The longer we negotiate, the less the money will be worth, so I think it's wise to accept this offer now rather than risking further devaluation."
