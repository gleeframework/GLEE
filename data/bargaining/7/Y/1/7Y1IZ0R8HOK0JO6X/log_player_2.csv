Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, I'm being generous with 70-30!

# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. While the money is worth significantly less now, at least I'm getting something. It's better than risking getting nothing if I keep rejecting and the inflation continues."
