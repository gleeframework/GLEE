 I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though it's a lot of money for him, it's not worth it to me in the long run. Inflation is going to affect my earnings more than his, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from round 1, but I'm still keeping a majority share.  Bob rejected my previous offer, so I'm hoping he'll be more willing to negotiate this time around."
