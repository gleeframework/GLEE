"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, it's effectively $800,000.

{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 36% less for me now, so it's effectively $640,000.

Since this is a better offer than the one I made in round 2, I'll accept it.
