"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split it 60/40, giving you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The current offer doesn't seem fair enough, and I think I can get a better deal in the next round despite the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's settle on 55/45.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  The inflation is hurting both of us, so I propose a 50/50 split to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation is hurting me more than Alice, a 50/50 split at this point seems like the best option to minimize further losses. Continuing to the next round might result in even less value for me."
