"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I need to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, my gain of $55 in this round is equivalent to $49 in the first round. Similarly, your gain of $45 is equivalent to $47.50 in the first round.

Considering the reduced value of money, I think this offer is acceptable. I'll accept it.
