Let's see if Bob is generous!  I'm starting with a fairly large share for myself, hoping to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent share of the money, and I don't want to risk further inflation reducing my potential gains."
