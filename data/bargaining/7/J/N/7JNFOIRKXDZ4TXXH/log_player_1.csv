"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000, and keeping $600,000 for myself. It's a fair split, but I'm hoping you'll think it's a good deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to get a 50/50 split! That's a fair offer, and since the money is already worth less due to inflation, I think it's a good time to settle.
