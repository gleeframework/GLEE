"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. We can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'm taking the majority of the initial amount, but still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's try 55/45, and we can adjust later if needed. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'm not convinced that 55/45 is a fairer split, considering the initial offer was 80/20. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2. Since Bob's offer was 55/45, I'll try to adjust my offer to be more competitive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. 50/50 seems fair, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge this round. Let's see if we can make a deal.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this more balanced offer!"
