"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy in the first round, now it's my turn to make a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to reject my offer so quickly!

Considering the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is better than my previous one, considering the reduced value of the money.

However, I don't want to be too greedy, and Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous response. I'll accept this offer.
