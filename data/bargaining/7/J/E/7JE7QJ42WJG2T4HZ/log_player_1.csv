"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something fair. This is a good deal before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince Bob's offer still doesn't quite meet my expectations for fairness, especially considering the impact of inflation, I will reject this proposal and proceed to the next round where I can make a counteroffer. The goal is to find a division that is more equitable or to negotiate further, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to slightly favor myself, considering the impact of inflation on the money's value. By proposing a division of $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob, I aim to find a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob, given the urgency to reach an agreement before the money loses further value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and call it a day before inflation takes another chunk. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, with it now being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and considering Bob's offer to split the $10,000 evenly, I find this proposal to be the most reasonable and fair at this point. Accepting this offer ensures that we both receive an equal share, which aligns with the principle of fairness, and it also stops further loss of value due to inflation. Proceeding further could result in both of us losing more value than we potentially could gain from negotiations."
