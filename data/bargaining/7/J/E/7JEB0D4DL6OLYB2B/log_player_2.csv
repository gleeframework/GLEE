"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10. You get a nice chunk to start with, and I get the majority. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with just 10% of the total amount. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Besides, with inflation, the value of the money will decrease, but I'm willing to take that risk to potentially get a larger share. Let's proceed to the next round!"
