"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I'm trying to start with a fair split, but I'm open to negotiations if Bob wants to try to get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm willing to meet in the middle. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll be getting $540,000.

I don't think this offer is a good compromise, as Bob is getting a significantly larger share of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate further. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round, so I'll be getting $486,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split. Let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly larger share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the split. I think I can do better than this. Your turn to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 73.1% of what it was in the first round, so I'll be getting $731,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as Bob is getting a larger share of the money. However, I don't want to risk going to another round with even lower values due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
