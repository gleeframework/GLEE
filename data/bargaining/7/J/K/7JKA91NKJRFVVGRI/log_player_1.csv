"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to flip the script on me, huh?

I'll think about it... and I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a slightly more even split than my initial offer, but still in my favor."
