"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is 45-55, which is a more favorable split for me, I'll accept the offer.
