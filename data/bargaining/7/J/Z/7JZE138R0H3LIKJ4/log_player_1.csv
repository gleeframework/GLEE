"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500,""bob_gain"": 4500,""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 45% and keep 55% for myself, with a message suggesting a fair split. Since the value of money decreases by 10% for me in each round, I want to end the game as soon as possible. Offering Bob less than half might encourage him to reject the offer and proceed to the next round, but I'm hoping he'll prefer a guaranteed 45% over the risk of getting less in a subsequent round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This offer benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the value of money has decreased by 10% for me, Bob's offer of an even split is actually more advantageous to him than my initial offer. However, considering the decreasing value of money for me in each round, I prefer to accept this offer rather than risking an even less favorable deal in the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer of 5000, which is now worth 4500 due to inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGame Over."
