"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $600,000 and you can take $400,000.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to be fair. Let's split it 65/35. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was initially. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in the first round, and 5% less than in the second round, I'll aim for a more aggressive split. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a bigger share last time, but I'm not giving up that much. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
