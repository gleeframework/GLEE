"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and end this quickly!""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm also adding a message to Bob, suggesting that we end the game quickly to avoid the negative effects of inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need for more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. Since the money is worth 5% less in this round, I'd actually be getting less value than I would have in the first round. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round, hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 52-48 split in my favor. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm taking that into account and trying to find a middle ground that's still favorable to me. I'm also adding a message to Bob, suggesting that we meet in the middle and consider the effects of inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's split it closer to 50/50. We both lose money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer of a 48-52 split. Considering the money is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I think it's time to cut my losses and take the offer. Bob's message makes sense, and I agree that we're both losing money with each round. I'll take the 48% share and end the game here.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
