Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit unfair. Let's be reasonable, I'll take a slight majority since I'm taking the risk here.  We can settle this now and avoid losing more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
