"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 6000, but I think it's a bit more fair considering the current inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
