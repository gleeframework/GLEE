"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid too many rounds. I take a bit more to start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. Alice is starting with a proposal that favors her, but I'm willing to negotiate. The inflation will hurt me more than her in the long run, but I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be realistic. This offer is fair considering the time pressure and inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be serious. Time is literally money for both of us, and my patience is wearing thin. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3520 
# Alice gain: 6480 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is playing tough, but this offer is getting worse for me.  It's clear she's trying to leverage the inflation against me. I'll call her bluff and see if she's willing to risk getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but your demands are unreasonable. This is my counter-offer, and I suggest you take it seriously before the money shrinks even further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or I'm walking away with nothing - and so will you. 
# Bob gain: 3136 
# Alice gain: 6864 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough situation, but I need to cut my losses. Alice is clearly willing to risk getting nothing to get a larger share. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee I receive something, even if it's significantly less than what I aimed for initially."
