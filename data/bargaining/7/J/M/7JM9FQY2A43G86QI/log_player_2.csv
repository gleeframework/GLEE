It's a good starting offer, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next round."

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take a smaller share this time, but we both get a better cut than in the last round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good compromise.  It's a better split for both of us compared to the last round, and I'm happy to take the offer."
