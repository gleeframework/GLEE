"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair starting point. I'm willing to share most of the money with you, but I'd like to keep a larger share since we're both losing value on our money with each round.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. We both lose value with each round, so a 50/50 split seems fair to me. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
