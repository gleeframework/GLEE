"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, it's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 900,000 in the first round is still worth 900,000, but Bob's gain of 100,000 is now worth 80,000 (20% less).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll reject it since I can still get more than 300,000. My next offer will be more aggressive.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of 900,000 in the first round is still worth 900,000, and Bob's gain of 100,000 is now worth 80,000.

My next offer will be to take a slightly smaller share, but still a significant one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A fair split, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough to convince him!"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 900,000 in the first round is still worth 900,000, and Bob's gain of 100,000 is now worth 51,200 (48.8% less).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll accept it since it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise. I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.
