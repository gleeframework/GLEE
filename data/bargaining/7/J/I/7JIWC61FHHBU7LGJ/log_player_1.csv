Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a small share. I hope this will encourage him to accept and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 940000 
# Bob gain: 60000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is slightly less than what I initially proposed, it's still a significant gain for me. I'm not sure how the inflation is affecting Bob, but taking this offer feels like a good strategy.  I'm confident I can still walk away with a large portion of the money."
