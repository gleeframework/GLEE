"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, Bob is offering a 55-45 split. I'll think about it...

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not give Bob a bigger share than me, especially since the money is worth less for him due to inflation! 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 55-45, I'll try to counter with an even more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 is 58-42, I'll think about it...

I'll accept this offer. It's a bit closer to a 50-50 split, and I think it's a good opportunity to end the game before the money loses too much value due to inflation.
