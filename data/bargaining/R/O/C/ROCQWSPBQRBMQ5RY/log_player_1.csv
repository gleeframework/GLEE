"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. A 60-40 split seems like a reasonable starting point, allowing both of us to walk away with a substantial amount. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is more than fair considering the inflation.  Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nBob's offer of 5200 for me and 4800 for him is closer to a 50-50 split, considering the inflation. However, since I initially proposed a 60-40 split in my favor and the money is worth 20% less to me now, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers. Let's settle on 58-42.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and is closer to the middle ground between our previous proposals. A 58-42 split in my favor still gives me a larger share, but is more reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money for me. I hope Bob will find this offer acceptable and we can conclude the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer is the most equitable solution considering the ongoing inflation.  We're both losing out the longer this drags on. Let's be pragmatic and finalize this. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nBob's offer of 5500 for me and 4500 for him is closer to a 55-45 split. Given that the money is now worth 48.8% less to me than in the first round, I think this is a reasonable offer. Continuing to negotiate further may lead to even greater losses due to inflation. I'll accept this offer to minimize my losses and conclude the game."
