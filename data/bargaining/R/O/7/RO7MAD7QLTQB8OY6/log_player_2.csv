"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling generous! Let's start with a 70/30 split.  Think about it - the longer we wait, the less it's worth. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The 70/30 split isn't quite fair in my opinion, and I think we can do better.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what Alice thinks! Please relay my decision to her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'd like to propose a 55/45 split. I think this is a more reasonable and fair division of the money. Since the value of the money decreases with each round, I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly.\n\n###\n\nHere's my offer in JSON format:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and make it fair!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that last offer was way off.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'm not thrilled about the offer, but considering the inflation and the fact that Alice is unlikely to budge, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money.\n\n###\n\nHere's my decision in JSON format:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
