"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start. You can try to do better if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering we both have equal say in the matter. Let's finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40$ is now worth 0.95 * 40 = 38$.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Since I'm not getting a better offer, I'll decide to accept this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
