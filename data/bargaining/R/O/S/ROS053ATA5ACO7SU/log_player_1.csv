"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 999,000 dollars and give Bob 1,000 dollars.  I figure this will give me the most money and hopefully will be enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

 While I'd prefer more money, I'm not sure Bob will get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is starting to hurt him, and this offer is at least fair.  I'll take it."
