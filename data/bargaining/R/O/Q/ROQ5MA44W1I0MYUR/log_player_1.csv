"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as needed.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, given the inflation rates. Let's try it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that this is a fair split, considering the inflation rates. I was hoping for a more balanced split, especially since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'd like to propose an alternative offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share due to the inflation affecting my gains.""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $550,000, and Bob gets 45%, which is $450,000."
