"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 seems reasonable.""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, hoping that Bob will see the fairness in this division and accept it early on to avoid the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, 60-40 for me this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because accepting a 40-60 split in his favor after I initially proposed a more even split doesn't seem fair to me. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next rounds, despite the inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nI'm adjusting my initial offer slightly, taking into account the inflation penalty but still aiming for a favorable split, hoping Bob will see the compromise and accept to avoid further devaluation."
