"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous deal for me.  I'm confident we can find a better solution for both of us in the future! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better deal. The current offer is too skewed in Alice's favor, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to potentially get a more equitable split. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the money fairly. We both get a good share, and we avoid further inflation!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fair split, Bob. But I'm still willing to negotiate. Let's move closer to my initial offer.  Remember, the longer we go, the more we both lose! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still don't think this offer is fair, considering the impact of inflation on my share. I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to get a better deal. The threat of further inflation is concerning, but I'm hoping to find a more balanced split in the next rounds. Let's keep going!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late!""}"
