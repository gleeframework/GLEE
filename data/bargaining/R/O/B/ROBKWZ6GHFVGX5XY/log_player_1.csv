"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation will favor me more in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This is a better deal for me than your offer, Bob, and it still gives you a decent amount considering the inflation.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is the fairest split given the current inflation rates. Let's reach an agreement before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to pressure me with the inflation, but his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. I need to hold out for a better deal.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to secure a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise - slightly better for me than your last offer, but still reasonable for you.  We need to agree soon!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. This is a fair split given the inflation, and I think it's time we settle this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is being very stubborn and knows time is on his side. However, I need to put my foot down.  Accepting this offer would mean I've effectively lost more than two-thirds of the initial value due to inflation.  I'm willing to take a risk and hope Bob starts making more serious concessions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day. Any further negotiation is just wasting time and hurting both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to play hardball.  Offering a 50/50 split highlights the absurdity of the situation.  It's a clear and simple offer that puts the pressure on Bob. He's been exploiting the inflation, but this offer makes it clear that his greed is jeopardizing a fair deal for both of us."
