Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I'm willing to compromise and meet closer to the middle. Let's try a 55-45 split and see if we can agree. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I think we can find a split that's more favorable to me, considering the inflation rates."

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to come down a bit from my previous offer, but I'm still confident that a 65-35 split is fair given the inflation rates. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value with each passing round. How about we simplify and split it 50-50? It's a fair and straightforward solution. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting us both hard, and a 50-50 split is the fairest option at this point. It's better than losing it all."
