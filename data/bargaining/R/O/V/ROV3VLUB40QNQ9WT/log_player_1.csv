"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money closer to 60/40 in my favor since I'm facing a higher inflation rate. We both get a decent amount this way. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
