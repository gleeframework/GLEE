"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a seemingly generous offer, but I'm keeping the lion's share for myself. I'm hoping Bob, being greedy, might accept this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it would have been nice to get more, this is a fair offer. I'd rather get 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
