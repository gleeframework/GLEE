"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good starting point for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the split isn't quite there yet. This offer considers the decreasing value of the money as time passes. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster rate of inflation for her. While her offer is slightly better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering her losses are accelerating faster than mine.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a fairer deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to be realistic. This offer is my bottom line. If we don't agree now, the deal will only get worse for both of us."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my share slightly from the last round to signal firmness while still offering Alice a reasonable amount considering the inflation. It's crucial to convey a sense of urgency now as the deal is losing value rapidly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your last offer was too low. I'm trying to find a middle ground. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical.  While Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, it's much closer to a reasonable split than before. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting a much worse offer in later rounds as the money rapidly loses value, especially for Alice. It's better to take a slightly unfavorable deal than risk walking away with nothing."
