Alice's offer:

I'm Bob, and I'm going to play strategically. It's better for me to reject the offer.  Even though it's a fair split now, the inflation will be to my advantage in the next round.  I'll see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm taking a bit more this round, knowing Alice's money will be worth less in the next round if she rejects.  This is a risk, but I believe the potential reward outweighs it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is offering a bit more than the first round, and although the inflation is affecting her side more, it's still in my best interest to accept.  It's better to take a slightly larger share now than risk her getting more in the next round, when her losses will be even greater."
