"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

With the value of money decreasing so rapidly, I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob, hoping he'll be more willing to compromise as the value of the money continues to drop!"
