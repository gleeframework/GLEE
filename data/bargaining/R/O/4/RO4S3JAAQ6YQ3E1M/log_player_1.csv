Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep 9000$ and give Bob 1000$.  This way, I get the most value now, since I'm aware of the inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, I know that each round brings inflation, making my gains less valuable. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me 3000$, which is better than the 8100$ I'd get if I rejected and then proposed."
