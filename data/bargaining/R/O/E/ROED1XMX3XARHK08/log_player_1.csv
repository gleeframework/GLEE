"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is getting worse for me with each round. It's better to settle now while I'm still offering more than half.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you, I think this is a fair offer now 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is tempting, accepting would mean I lose out significantly compared to the initial rounds. It's a waiting game now. Bob knows I'm losing value, but he also wants to maximize his gain. I'll hold out a little longer and hope he offers a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's stop wasting time and split the difference. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm applying pressure and highlighting the impact of inflation.  Bob needs to understand that his stubbornness will cost us both in the long run. By offering a 50/50 split (after inflation), I'm signaling a willingness to compromise, but also setting a firm boundary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, this is getting ridiculous. But inflation is on my side. I'm willing to take a bigger share now 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but I need to accept.  Another round, and Bob's offer will likely be even worse.  The longer this drags on, the more I lose. Accepting now cuts my losses. Bob played the waiting game well."
