"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with $1,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more fair this time. I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in Round 2, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $4,500 (not $4,5000, but I'll assume it's a typo)
Bob gain: $5,500

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
