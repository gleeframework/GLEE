"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, with me taking the larger share due to the potential for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Inflation is a risk for both of us, but I'm willing to be fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to offset the growing inflation.  Let's aim for a 60/40 split. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 60/40 split isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers and the money continues to depreciate."
