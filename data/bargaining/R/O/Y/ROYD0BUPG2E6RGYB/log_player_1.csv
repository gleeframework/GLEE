"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $5000 is worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4500. Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4000.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd like to get more than $4500."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values of the gains in the first round:

My gain of $4000 is worth 73.9% of its original value (100% - 26.1% = 73.9%).
Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%).

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's the best one I've seen so far, and I'd rather get $2920 (73.9% of $4000) than risk waiting for another round and possibly getting even less."
