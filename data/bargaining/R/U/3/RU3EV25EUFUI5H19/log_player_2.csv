"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I take a bit more since I'm the one proposing. I'm open to negotiation though! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take some money now, it's risky to accept such a lopsided split this early in the game. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds, especially considering the inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
