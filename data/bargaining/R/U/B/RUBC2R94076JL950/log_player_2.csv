"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you'll get a decent chunk.  We can work out something better later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a fairer deal.  1,000$ is not a ""decent chunk"" and Alice is clearly trying to take advantage.  Let's see what kind of offer I can get by rejecting this one."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering a split that's more even, and we can both get a significant amount.  Accept this, and we can both walk away with a good amount of money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a bigger share.  Let's split the difference from your last offer.  We can end this quickly and both still get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to get a larger share.  I'll keep rejecting until she offers something closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4750, ""alice_gain"": 5250, ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my offer from last round.  It's fair, and we're both losing money with each passing round.  Accept this, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.""}
