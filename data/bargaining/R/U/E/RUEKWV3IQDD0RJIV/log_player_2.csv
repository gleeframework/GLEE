"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair deal, Bob.  I'm taking a big chunk, but I'm offering you something to start.  Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Besides, the money is still worth a lot to me at this point, and I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value to potentially get a bigger share. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair division, considering the money is losing value for both of us. I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I also want to get a decent amount. Let's be reasonable!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I see you're playing hardball.  Let's meet in the middle.  This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for me due to inflation, and Alice's message stating this is her final offer, I believe accepting this deal is the best option. The risk of proceeding to another round and facing further devaluation outweighs the potential benefits of negotiating for a slightly better share. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise at this point."
