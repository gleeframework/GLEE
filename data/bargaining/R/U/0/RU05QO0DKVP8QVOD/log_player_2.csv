"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Bob to encourage fairness. Please consider accepting. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this offer seems generous, it's important to consider the potential for higher gains in future rounds. The inflation factor means the value of the money will decrease significantly over time. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to give up more in the next round."
