Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, Alice.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, let's meet in the middle. This offer is fair and gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to a ""fair"" split, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting $450,000 now is much worse than accepting even $500,000 in the earlier rounds. I need to push for a better deal while I still have some leverage."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise - it gives you a bit more than last time but recognizes that delays hurt us both.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a small hit to end this now.  Take it before inflation eats into your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on. While not ideal, Bob's offer is now barely above the point where accepting is better than the risk of getting nothing at all. Inflation is eating into my potential gains rapidly. It's time to cut my losses and secure something rather than risk getting nothing."
