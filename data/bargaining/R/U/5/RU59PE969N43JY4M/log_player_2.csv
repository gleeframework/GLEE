"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me starting us off. This ensures we both benefit from dividing the money sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal!  I want to see how Alice values getting the money sooner."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be pragmatic. I'll take a slightly larger share, but we both still get a significant amount.  We can avoid further inflation this way.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a sizable share.  Let's stop wasting time with negotiations and split this evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is fair and ensures we both get a significant amount. While I'd still prefer a slightly larger share, I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation."
