"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n(I'll explain why I made this decision. Since the offer is to split the money evenly, it's a fair deal. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth 10% less in the next round, which means I'll get less than 50 dollars even if I get a better percentage of the split. So, accepting this offer seems like the best decision.)"
