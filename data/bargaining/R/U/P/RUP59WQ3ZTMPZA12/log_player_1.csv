"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}

I'm offering to take $6,000 and giving Bob $4,000. I think this is a reasonable offer, considering I'm giving him a significant amount of money. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""I'm not going lower than this, think about the inflation!""}\n\nI'm giving Bob another chance to accept a reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for him in each round, I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to accept this offer rather than risking another round."
