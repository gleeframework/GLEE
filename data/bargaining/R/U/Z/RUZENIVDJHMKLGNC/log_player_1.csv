  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio, where I receive $7500 and you receive $2500. This offers a fair distribution considering the potential loss due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 1:1 split, giving us both $5000. This way, we both get an equal share of the initial amount, and we can avoid the uncertainty of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
