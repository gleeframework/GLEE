"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not too thrilled about the reduced share. However, I don't want to give up too much either. I'll have to weigh the options.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again!

Considering the 20% reduction in value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive with my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, it's time to meet me in the middle""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle as you suggested! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is willing to meet in the middle after all!

Considering the significant reduction in the value of the money due to inflation, a 50-50 split seems like a reasonable compromise. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's hope this is the end of the negotiations!"
