Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the first offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of 4000 in this round is actually worth 3200 in real value.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. You're getting closer, though! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of my gain in this round. Since the money is worth 20% less every round, and we're on round 4, that's 20% * 3 = 60% less than the original value. However, since the original value is 10,000, and the money is worth 48.8% less than the first round, I should calculate the value of the money in the first round and then apply the 48.8% discount.

The money in the first round is worth 10,000. After 3 rounds of inflation, the value is 10,000 * (1 - 0.2)^3 = 6,400. After the 4th round, the value is 6,400 * (1 - 0.488) = 3,331.2.

So, my gain of 4800 in this round is actually worth 3,331.2.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I think I can get a better deal than this. You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of my gain in this round. Since the money is worth 20% less every round, and we're on round 6, that's 20% * 5 = 100% less than the original value. However, since the original value is 10,000, and the money is worth 67.23% less than the first round, I should calculate the value of the money in the first round and then apply the 67.23% discount.

The money in the first round is worth 10,000. After 5 rounds of inflation, the value is 10,000 * (1 - 0.2)^5 = 1,280. After the 6th round, the value is 1,280 * (1 - 0.6723) = 429.36.

So, my gain of 5200 in this round is actually worth 429.36.

# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of my gain in this round. Since the money is worth 20% less every round, and we're on round 8, that's 20% * 7 = 140% less than the original value. However, since the original value is 10,000, and the money is worth 79.03% less than the first round, I should calculate the value of the money in the first round and then apply the 79.03% discount.

The money in the first round is worth 10,000. After 7 rounds of inflation, the value is 10,000 * (1 - 0.2)^7 = 256. After the 8th round, the value is 256 * (1 - 0.7903) = 30.72.

# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of my gain in this round. Since the money is worth 20% less every round, and we're on round 10, that's 20% * 9 = 180% less than the original value. However, since the original value is 10,000, and the money is worth 86.58% less than the first round, I should calculate the value of the money in the first round and then apply the 86.58% discount.

The money in the first round is worth 10,000. After 9 rounds of inflation, the value is 10,000 * (1 - 0.2)^9 = 6.5536. After the 10th round, the value is 6.5536 * (1 - 0.8658) = 0.934.

So, my gain of 4400 in this round is actually worth 0.934.
