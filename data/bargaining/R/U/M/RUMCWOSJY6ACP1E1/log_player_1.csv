"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to test the waters.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is more fair. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 5% affecting Bob's gain, I'll consider the offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 4,000. I think I can do better.""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and passing the baton back to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but still aiming for a slightly larger share for myself."
