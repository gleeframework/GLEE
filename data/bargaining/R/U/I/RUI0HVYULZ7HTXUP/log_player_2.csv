# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the ""fair"" split, I know that the money is worth less with each passing round. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer. The money is losing value quickly, and I'm not willing to settle for less than 600,000. I'm going to see if I can convince Alice to take my previous offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's stick with my previous offer. The value of the money keeps decreasing, and this is the best deal we can both get.""}
```"

# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offers are getting closer to mine, but the value of the money is dropping too fast. I'm going to stick to my demand for 600,000. I need to secure a better deal before the value plummets further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
