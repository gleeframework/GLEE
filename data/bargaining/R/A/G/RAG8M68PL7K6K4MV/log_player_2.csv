"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the offer is to split the $100 evenly, resulting in a gain of $50 for both players, and considering the principle of fairness as mentioned by Alice, accepting this offer seems reasonable. It ensures an equal share without the risk of receiving a less favorable offer in subsequent rounds."
