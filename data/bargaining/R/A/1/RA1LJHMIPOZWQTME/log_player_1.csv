I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$.  This seems like a fair starting point, given that I have to deal with inflation.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to wait a round and see if Bob comes back with a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering 800,000$ for myself and 200,000$ for Bob.  This is a significant compromise from my original offer, but I still believe it's fair given the inflation.  Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and while this isn't ideal, it's better than waiting another round and getting even less.  It seems like Bob is willing to negotiate, so I'm taking what I can get!"
