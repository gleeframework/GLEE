Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share now to avoid further erosion of value due to inflation. I propose a 4:1 ratio, but still leaving you with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
