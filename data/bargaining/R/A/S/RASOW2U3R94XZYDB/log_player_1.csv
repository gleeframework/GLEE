```

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, Alice. I'll take the majority. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3,000 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $2,400, and Bob's gain of $7,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $6,300.

I'll reject this offer. My gain is too low, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.
