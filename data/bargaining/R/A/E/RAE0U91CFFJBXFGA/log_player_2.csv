# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up that much. This is a more reasonable offer that still allows for a good outcome for both of us. Let's be practical and settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
