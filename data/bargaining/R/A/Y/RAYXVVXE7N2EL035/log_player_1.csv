Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45. Since the money loses value over time, it's better to settle now rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand the time pressure, Bob, but your last offer wasn't fair to me. Let's be reasonable and split it 55/45.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decreasing value, I'm willing to take a bit more. 58/42 is my new offer. It's better to settle now than lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right about the time pressure, he's still taking a significantly larger share. The decreasing value impacts me more than him, but I need to hold out for a more balanced offer. Accepting 42 now would mean I lost out on a significant portion of the initial $100."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The value is dropping fast for both of us. Let's just split it 50/50 and be done with it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push for a more drastic solution. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. A 50/50 split, while not ideal in earlier rounds, now represents a fair compromise given the rapidly decreasing value."
