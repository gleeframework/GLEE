"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000,""bob_gain"": 4000,""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that suggests this is a fair division. Since the money loses value for me with each round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we'll be dealing with. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less to me now, I need to consider the reduced value in my decision. Bob's offer of $4500 for me is actually worth $4050 considering the inflation, which is less than half of the original amount. I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round or make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800,""bob_gain"": 4200,""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a 58-42 split in my favor. Given the inflation, I'm actually offering less value to myself than in the first round, but I'm hoping Bob will see this as a compromise. The message emphasizes that I'm taking the inflation into account, which I hope will make the offer more appealing to Bob. I want to reach an agreement soon, as the decreasing value of the money is putting pressure on me to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both lose more with each round, so it's in our best interest to agree now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, the $5000 I would gain is actually worth around $3650, but I think accepting this offer is the best decision at this point. With each round, the value of the money decreases further for me, and there's a risk that Bob might make less favorable offers in the future. Since Bob is offering an even split, I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further losses due to inflation."
