6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6000 and you get $4000. This way we both benefit from settling early.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think it's fairer to split it closer to 50/50. I'm willing to take a slight loss to avoid the inflation penalty.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"I understand you want a more even split, but I need to account for the inflation hitting me harder.  This offer is a compromise, slightly better for you than last round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it down the middle.  We both lose less to inflation that way.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, time is running out and the pot is shrinking.  This is a 55/45 split before inflation, which is more than fair to you given the circumstances. Let's be reasonable and close this out.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's try to come to an agreement before it's too late. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this offer, but we need to close this out.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,accept
