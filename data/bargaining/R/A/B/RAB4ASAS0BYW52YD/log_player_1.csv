"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split would be fairer.  Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my potential gain is now 6400 dollars.

I'm not thrilled with the 2:3 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
