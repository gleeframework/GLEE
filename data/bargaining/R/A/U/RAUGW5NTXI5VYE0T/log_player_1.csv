"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a fair share, but I'm not giving you the majority just yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of the original $4000, which is $3600. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of the original $6000, which is $5700.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept it.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
