"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's start with a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the compromise, but I'm willing to consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take $4,000 and Bob will get $6,000. Let's see how this compromise works out!"
