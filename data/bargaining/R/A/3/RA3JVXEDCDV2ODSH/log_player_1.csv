I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on, but I'm also leaving Bob with something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to split the money more evenly this time. Since Bob rejected my previous offer and I'm now aware of his negotiating style, I'll offer a 70/30 split in my favor. This should be a good compromise."
