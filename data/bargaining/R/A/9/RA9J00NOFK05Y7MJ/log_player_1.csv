"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $550,000, which is slightly more than half, and leave Bob with $450,000. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness while also asserting my own interests. Since it's the first round, I'm trying to set a tone for the negotiation that slightly favors me but still leaves room for Bob to consider it a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split it more evenly, but I'll need a bit more than you offered last time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, the offer doesn't move significantly towards a more equitable split from my perspective. Bob is still taking more than half, and considering the inflation hits me harder, I'm not inclined to accept an offer that doesn't compensate for this disparity. By rejecting, I aim to pressure Bob into a more favorable division in the next round or to reconsider with a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm trying to find a compromise that takes into account the impact of inflation on both of us. By proposing a division of $520,000 for myself and $480,000 for Bob, I'm attempting to meet Bob halfway between our previous offers, while also considering the fact that inflation affects me more significantly. The message ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground"" aims to convey my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution, despite the decreasing value of the money."
