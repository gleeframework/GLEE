"Round 1

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on Bob, meet me in the middle, 58-42 is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging while the pot shrinks.  It's worth holding out for a better deal, even if it means a slightly lower amount later due to inflation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 52,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't think you can pressure me, Bob. 56-44 is still on the table. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is demonstrating that she's willing to play hardball and isn't budging much. However, with the current rate of inflation, the pot is shrinking quickly. It's time to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a bad deal. Accepting now would set a precedent."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
