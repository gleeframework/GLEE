Round 5

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as time goes on and the value of her potential winnings decreases. We're past the halfway point, and she's still fixated on getting a larger share even though it's worth significantly less. By continuing to reject her offers, I increase the pressure on her to make a more substantial concession."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, final offer. A clean 50/50 split. Take it or leave it. Time is running out for both of us.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my guns with the 50/50 split. This round, I'm making it clear this is my final offer. The message is designed to:

* **Convey urgency:**  ""Time is running out"" emphasizes that  delay hurts both of us.
* **Appear firm:**  ""Take it or leave it"" suggests I'm not budging, increasing pressure on Alice. 
* **Maintain fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair, preventing me from seeming overly greedy and potentially making Alice more receptive."
