"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a relatively fair offer considering the decreasing value of money for him in each subsequent round. This way, we can both benefit without having to go through multiple rounds and losing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, since I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob in each subsequent round, he will be more inclined to accept a less favorable offer as the game progresses. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 57-43 is a more reasonable split now.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the effect of inflation on Bob's potential gain. Since the money is worth 5% less for him in each subsequent round, I'm making a slightly more favorable offer to myself while still trying to appear reasonable. I believe this offer has a good chance of being accepted by Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We're both losing value with each round, so a 50-50 split is the most logical choice now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob presents a 50-50 split as the most logical choice, I must consider the impact of inflation on his gain. Since the money is worth 14.26% less for him now compared to the first round, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. By rejecting this offer and proceeding to the next round, I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's increasing urgency to settle due to the decreasing value of the money for him. This might allow me to secure a larger share of the $10,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the current inflation, I think 58-42 is a generous offer. The longer we wait, the less you'll get.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm emphasizing the effect of inflation on Bob's potential gain and the urgency of the situation. By highlighting that the longer we wait, the less he'll get, I'm trying to create a sense of pressure that might encourage Bob to accept my offer. The split of 58-42 is slightly more in my favor than the previous offer, reflecting the increasing leverage I have due to the impact of inflation on Bob's side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I think a 48-52 split is fair given the current inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite Bob's willingness to compromise, the split is still not as favorable to me as I believe it could be. Given the significant decrease in value for Bob (22.62% less than in the first round), I think he is more likely to accept an even less favorable offer in the next rounds. By continuing to negotiate, I aim to capitalize on Bob's increasing desperation due to the inflation, potentially securing an even larger share of the money for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Given the substantial impact of inflation on your gain, I believe a 60-40 split is now more than fair. It's in both our interests to conclude this soon.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm returning to my initial offer of a 60-40 split, emphasizing that due to the significant decrease in value for Bob (22.62% less than in the first round), this split is now more than fair. I'm highlighting the urgency of the situation, suggesting that it's in both our interests to conclude the negotiation soon. The aim is to persuade Bob that, considering the ongoing inflation, this offer is the best he can reasonably expect, and accepting it would be the prudent decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With each round, the value of my share decreases significantly. I'm willing to accept a 45-55 split to finalize this before we both lose more money. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob is showing a willingness to compromise further due to the increasing impact of inflation on his potential gain, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. With the money being worth 30.17% less for Bob than in the first round, the pressure is mounting on him to accept a less favorable offer rather than risk further devaluation. By rejecting this offer and moving to the next round, I aim to exploit this pressure to secure an even larger share of the $10,000 for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Considering the severe impact of inflation on your gain, I'm only willing to offer a 62-38 split. This is a final offer before we risk losing everything.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a more assertive offer, taking into account the substantial decrease in value for Bob (30.17% less than in the first round). I'm framing this as a final offer, emphasizing that we risk losing everything if we don't come to an agreement soon. By doing so, I'm applying pressure on Bob to accept this deal, as the alternative is potentially walking away with nothing. This approach aims to capitalize on Bob's increasing desperation due to the ongoing inflation, securing the best possible deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a 40-60 split to avoid losing everything. It's getting risky, and I don't want to gamble anymore. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting this offer because Bob has finally agreed to the 60-40 split that I initially proposed and have been aiming for throughout the negotiation. Given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain (36.98% less than in the first round), it's clear that he is highly motivated to settle and avoid further losses. By accepting this offer, I'm securing the largest share of the $10,000 possible under the circumstances, achieving my goal in the negotiation. Further rounds would only increase the risk of Bob becoming more desperate and potentially walking away, which would result in both of us receiving nothing. Therefore, accepting this offer is the most prudent decision at this stage."
