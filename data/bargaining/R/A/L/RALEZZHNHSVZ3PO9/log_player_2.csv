{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. I understand you want a larger share, but let's be reasonable. How about a 60/40 split in your favor? This accounts for the time value and gives us both something.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the value for you keeps decreasing! I'm offering 65/35.  Take it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, you're right about the time pressure, but I'm also losing value with every passing round.  Let's meet in the middle - 55/45 seems fair considering the circumstances.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my previous offer of 60/40.  This is your last chance to get a decent share before inflation eats away even more of your potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, accepting a 60/40 split is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Shrinking Gains:** The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing rapidly. Waiting any longer means accepting even less.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has presented the 60/40 split twice, indicating she's unlikely to budge much further. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing dramatically increases. 

While not ideal, accepting the 60/40 offer ensures Bob receives something, which is better than nothing as the game progresses."
