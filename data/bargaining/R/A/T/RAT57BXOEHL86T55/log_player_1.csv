"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the starting point 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gains.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 2000$. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking further erosion of value due to inflation."
