"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount for the first round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small portion, to test his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider the offer carefully.

I'll reject this offer because I'm not getting a good enough share, considering the initial amount of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive. Since Bob's offer was $4,000, I'll try to get closer to my initial target of $8,000.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worth my while""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much more. I'm starting to get worried about the value of my share. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll consider the offer carefully.

I'll accept this offer because I'm getting a decent share, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round. Bob's concerns about the value of his share are valid, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round.
