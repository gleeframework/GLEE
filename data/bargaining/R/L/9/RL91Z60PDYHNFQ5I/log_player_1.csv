"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose Alice gets $9000 and Bob gets $1000. This is a good starting point, and I believe it's fair considering Bob will be able to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a major factor.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me at least $5000, which is better than the risk of getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
