"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money!"

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
