"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and simple way to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, as I think it's a bit unfair. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
