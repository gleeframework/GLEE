"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000, and I'll take $6000. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too one-sided. I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity. I'll wait for a more balanced offer.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more reasonable proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a slightly larger share this time. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize the deal.""
}
```"
