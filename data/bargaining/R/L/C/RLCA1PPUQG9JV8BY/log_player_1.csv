Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest way to start, and we can both benefit from the money sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
