"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting 70 dollars and Bob getting 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and see if it's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 50 dollars is actually worth 47.5 dollars (100 * 0.95).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
