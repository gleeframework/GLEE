"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but let's be more even. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm not as motivated to push for a higher share. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
