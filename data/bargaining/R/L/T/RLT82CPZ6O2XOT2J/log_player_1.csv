I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too happy about the reduced value of Bob's gain due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
