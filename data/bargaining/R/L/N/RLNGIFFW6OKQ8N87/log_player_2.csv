Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Even though the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, time is on my side. Alice's losses from inflation are increasing at a faster rate than mine. By continuing to reject offers slightly in her favor, I increase the pressure on her to offer a deal where I benefit more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value.""} 

**Reasoning:**

The longer the game goes on, the more we both lose due to inflation.  While I was hoping to secure a slight advantage, offering a 50/50 split at this stage:

* **Demonstrates fairness:**  It shows I'm willing to compromise and not be ruthlessly opportunistic.
* **Creates urgency:** Alice will realize that further delays only hurt both of us. 
* **Provides a clean resolution:**  A 50/50 split is easy to agree on, reducing further negotiation and potential stalemates."
