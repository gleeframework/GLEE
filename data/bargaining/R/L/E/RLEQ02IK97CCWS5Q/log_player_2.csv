"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we should split a bit more evenly, considering I get to propose in this round. This offer is better for me than what you'll get if you reject.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness with a Time Discount:**  Alice's initial offer was skewed in her favor. While a 50/50 split might seem fair initially, Bob has a time advantage in this round.  He factors in the 10% inflation, making his offer more appealing than what Alice would get if she rejects and proposes in the next round.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Bob's message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive. He highlights the time-sensitive nature of the game and the benefits of accepting his offer now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Accepting $4200 now is better than risking a worse offer in a future round where the value will decrease even further.
* **Alice's Compromise:**  While still in Alice's favor, her offer acknowledges Bob's position by moving closer to a more even split. It suggests she is willing to negotiate reasonably.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a potentially better offer carries the risk of Alice becoming more determined to secure a larger share for herself, especially as the stakes decrease. 

It's better for Bob to accept a reasonable, though not ideal, offer now than to gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
