"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I know it's a big ask, but I want to secure a significant portion of the money before inflation significantly impacts my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to lower my share a bit to try and reach a compromise.  I'm hoping this offer is more reasonable than Bob's previous proposal, and that it encourages him to accept before inflation erodes the value of the money even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted, the inflation has already taken a heavy toll. It's better to secure a smaller share now than risk losing even more in the next round."
