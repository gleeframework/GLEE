"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as I am taking on the risk of making the first offer. I believe it's in Bob's best interest to accept this, as there is a chance he might receive nothing if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation factor makes this offer increasingly appealing.  Accepting this ensures I get at least some money, and the risk of receiving nothing in the next round is high."
