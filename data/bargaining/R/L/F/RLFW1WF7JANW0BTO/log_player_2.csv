"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair to take the majority share, as I'm the one who proposed first. But we can negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide it more fairly, considering I'm giving you a chance to finish the game early and save from inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  I'm willing to give you a larger share, but we're both losing value with each round. It's time to make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think it's best to accept this offer, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me. Proceeding further would likely result in a worse outcome due to inflation."
