Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about 53/47? It's better for you than the last round, and it accounts for the fact that the money is losing value more quickly for me. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300
