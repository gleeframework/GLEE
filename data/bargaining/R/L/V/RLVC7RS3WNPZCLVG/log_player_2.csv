Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The clock is ticking and the money is shrinking. I'll take a slight hit - $5500 for me, $4500 for you.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\n### Considering the significant impact of inflation on the money's value, especially for Alice, this offer seems reasonable.
