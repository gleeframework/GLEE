"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work out a more even split in the future if you accept. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice promises a more even split in the future, there's no guarantee.  It's better to see what kind of offer I can get by rejecting and proposing myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our gains.""}
