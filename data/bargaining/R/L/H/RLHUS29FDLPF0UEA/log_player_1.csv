"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering a slightly better deal, but still a 60/40 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my potential gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round.

I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the offer, I think I should accept it. The offer is still a 60/40 split, but it's better than the previous offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
