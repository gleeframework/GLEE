Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Come on, Alice. I think we can do better than your initial offer. Considering the money's losing value, let's not drag this out. This is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, we both know this money is going to be worth a lot less very soon. I'm being more than fair offering you 4500. Take it before it shrinks even more!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we've both lost a significant amount already. I think it's only fair we split it closer to the middle, considering what's left. Let's settle before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting greedier with each round, even though the pot is shrinking. I need to hold firm to get a better deal, but I also need to be mindful that the money is rapidly losing value. In the next round, I'll aim for a slightly better offer than this one but still heavily in my favor."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it down the middle before inflation eats up even more of the money. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this point."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** While I'd prefer a larger share, dragging this out any further is pointless.  A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome at this stage, and it avoids further losses due to inflation."
