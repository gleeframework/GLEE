4500.0,5500.0,"Come on, Alice. I think we can do better than your initial offer. Considering the money's losing value, let's not drag this out. This is a fairer split.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, we both know this money is going to be worth a lot less very soon. I'm being more than fair offering you 4500. Take it before it shrinks even more!",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, we've both lost a significant amount already. I think it's only fair we split it closer to the middle, considering what's left. Let's settle before it's too late.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it down the middle before inflation eats up even more of the money. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this point.",Alice,5,
