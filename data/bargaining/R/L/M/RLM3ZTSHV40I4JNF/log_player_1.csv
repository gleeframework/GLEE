"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Half and half, let's start with a fair split!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a fair and simple proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly biased split, but still a decent offer! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'll be gaining $400,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob will gain $600,000, which is 10% less than in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about the biased split, but it's a decent offer, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better one in the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
