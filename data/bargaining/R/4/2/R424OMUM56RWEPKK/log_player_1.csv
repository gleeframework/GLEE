Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to accept a 50/50 split than risk further inflation and potential losses."
