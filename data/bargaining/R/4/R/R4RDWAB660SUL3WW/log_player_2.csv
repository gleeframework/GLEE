"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good deal for you in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm not sure I'd call that a good deal for me. We're both losing value with each round, so I'll see if I can get a better deal next time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a little more this round, but I'm still hoping for a better deal for myself.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. Let's be practical and split it 50/50.  This offer won't get any better for you. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'm getting a much worse deal with each round, and a 50/50 split is better than what I'm likely to get if we keep going.  Let's call it a day."
