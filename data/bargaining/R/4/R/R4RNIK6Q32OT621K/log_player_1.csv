"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less, accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a substantial gain, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds with further inflation."
