I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but still offers Bob a decent share. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to get more, Bob's offer is fair and it's better than risking getting less in the next round due to inflation."
