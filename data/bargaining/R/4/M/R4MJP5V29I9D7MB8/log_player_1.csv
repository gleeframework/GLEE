"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a slightly higher share to myself, considering the 20% decrease in value for each round. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and it's relatively fair. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable, this offer keeps us both ahead of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, considering the inflation, I'd be getting significantly less value than initially proposed. Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway on the loss.""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, I'm adjusting my offer to slightly favor Bob while still being mindful of my own loss in value. Hopefully, this compromise will be acceptable to Bob."
