"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $1,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $800.

Bob's offer is:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 

I accept this offer.
