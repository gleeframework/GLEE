This is a tough one! Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the value for me keeps decreasing.  
* **Decent Offer:** While not ideal, getting $6,000 is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. 
* **Bob's Pattern:** Bob seems to be sticking close to the 60/40 split, making it unlikely he'll drastically change his offer.

It's a gamble, but waiting longer carries the risk of ending up with nothing."
