"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. Given the inflation rates, it's in both our interests to conclude the deal quickly, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting a slightly uneven split to avoid further devaluation of the money. The message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness while also highlighting the benefits of accepting the offer sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. How about a slightly more balanced split this time? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer is more balanced, considering the inflation, accepting $5,500 now is less valuable than it would have been in the first round. Additionally, Bob is experiencing a higher rate of inflation, which means that if we continue, the pressure is more on Bob to settle. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, despite the decrease in value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more generous offer than it seems. Let's end this before the money devalues further.""}\n\nGiven the ongoing inflation, my aim is to appear flexible while still securing a favorable deal. By slightly decreasing my share from the initial offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm also emphasizing the urgency due to inflation, hoping Bob will see the benefit in accepting this offer before the money loses more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of rounds. This is my final offer before the money loses significant value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us, Bob's offer of $5,600 for me is reasonable. The difference in our inflation rates means that Bob is under more pressure, but the offer is fair enough that continuing to negotiate could result in a less favorable outcome due to the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Accepting now seems like the best decision to maximize my gain."
