"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair split, and if Bob accepts, we can both get a decent amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. This is the fairest way to divide it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in the same terms.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to settle for an even split just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of this to my advantage. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a smaller share due to inflation, so I'm taking a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm hoping Bob will be hesitant to accept this offer due to the decreased value of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be fair. I'm offering a slightly higher share for you to account for inflation, but I need a reasonable share too. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's share being worth less due to inflation, I think this offer is a good compromise. I'm willing to accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
