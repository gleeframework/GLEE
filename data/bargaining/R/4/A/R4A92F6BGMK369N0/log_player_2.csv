Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at 64/36, Bob. This is my final offer.

# Alice gain: 640000

While I would prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is the best I've been able to get. Further negotiation risks losing even more due to inflation."
