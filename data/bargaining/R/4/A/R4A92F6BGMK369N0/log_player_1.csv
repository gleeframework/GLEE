Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can split the million.""

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, so I hope Bob will accept!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 95% of its original value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a good start, but I'm not sure I'm willing to give up that much. Can you consider a slightly more favorable split for me?""
