Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get something back too. Let's end this before we lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round. Since Alice's money is losing value faster, I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""You're losing value fast, I'll take a bigger share. It's better for you to accept now than to lose even more in the next round.""}"
