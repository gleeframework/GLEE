Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40/60, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to 50/50. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth around 36.6 (100 * 0.19) less than the 40 I could have gotten in the first round, so it's a relatively good deal. I'll accept.
