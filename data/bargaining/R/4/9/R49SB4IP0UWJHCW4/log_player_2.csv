"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it 60-40, I'm the one making the first offer after all! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I think we can do better than that.  Let's see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think it's only fair that we split the money 60-40 in my favor since I'm the one making the offer this time.  Let's be reasonable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle, 58-42 is a fair deal considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's still a bit less than I'd like, I'm willing to take the 420,000.  Inflation is a real concern, and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting this offer."
