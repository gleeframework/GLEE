**Explanation:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice given the circumstances. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has framed this as his final offer, implying he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Minimal Difference:** The difference between my offer in Round 3 and Bob's offer in Round 4 is only $200. Accepting now avoids the risk of receiving a much lower offer in a future round where the inflation impact is even greater. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting prevents a potentially worse outcome due to the inflationary pressure."
