"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, Alice! I'll take this offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 20% less, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round either.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split the difference!""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'll take the majority. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now! The money I gain is worth a significant amount less than in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about accepting a smaller share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even smaller amount. I'll have to consider this offer carefully.

However, I'm not convinced that I'm getting the best deal, and I'm worried that if I accept, Bob might not be willing to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. Let's get this over with. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crushing me now! The money I gain is worth a tiny fraction of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about accepting such a small share, but I'm running out of time and options. I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even smaller amount.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
