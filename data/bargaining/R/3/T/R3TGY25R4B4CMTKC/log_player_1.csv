Let's see if Bob accepts this first offer!  I'm aiming for a high gain but leaving him just a sliver to hopefully encourage him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a pretty bad deal for me, and there's still a lot of time left. I'm betting that Bob will be more desperate for money in the next round, since the value of his gain will be dropping!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very low, and I believe his gains are suffering more from inflation than mine. I'm going to keep rejecting his offers in hopes that he'll cave in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still offering a large portion to Bob.  Inflation is likely hurting him more and more, and I think this offer might be tempting enough to get him to agree."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 50/50 split is tempting, I still believe I can get a better deal. The inflation is hitting Bob hard, and he's likely feeling desperate at this point.  I'm going to keep rejecting his offers, as I'm confident I can get more in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still offering a good chunk of the money to Bob. By this point, the inflation must be making his potential gains significantly less valuable, and I'm hoping this will be enough to sway him."

While the offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm sticking to my strategy. Inflation is hurting Bob much more than it's hurting me. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next couple of rounds."
