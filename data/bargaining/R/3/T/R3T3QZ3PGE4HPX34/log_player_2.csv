"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work out a more even split later if you're willing to play along. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a risky move to accept such a lopsided deal right away, especially considering the inflation. It's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way we both get a good share and can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our earnings.""}
