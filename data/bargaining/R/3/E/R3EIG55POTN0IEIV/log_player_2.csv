Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about fairness, but I need to factor in the faster devaluation for me. This offer is a compromise, meeting closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer in Round 3 is becoming more reasonable.  Here's why I choose to accept:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer this goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us. Accepting now cuts my losses from inflation.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the faster devaluation. Her offers are trending towards a more even split. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in later rounds is very risky. The potential gains are small compared to the potential losses from inflation."
