"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you get something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can negotiate for a larger share. It's just the first round, and I have 11 more rounds to try and get a better deal. Alice's offer is too skewed in her favor, and I'm not willing to settle for just 10% of the total amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced approach. I think 40% for me and 60% for you is a reasonable starting point for further negotiations.""}\n\n###\nI've decided to offer Alice 60% of the total amount, which is a more generous offer than what she initially proposed. By doing so, I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. This offer also gives me a higher share than what I was initially offered, which is a better starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 70/30 is a fair starting point for a deal. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Alice's offer again because, although she's willing to compromise, the 70/30 split is still too skewed in her favor. I believe I can negotiate for an even better deal, especially since we're only in the third round. By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm not willing to settle for less than what I think is fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiations to get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I see we're making progress, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 45% for me and 55% for you? I'm getting closer to my limit, so let's try to meet in the middle.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my proposed share to 45%, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. By doing so, I'm trying to nudge Alice closer to a more equitable split while still being mindful of her initial reluctance to give up too much. I'm also signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit, which is a subtle hint that I may not be willing to go much further in terms of concessions."
