"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let us share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering a 60-40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation penalty I will incur if we proceed to further rounds. I am willing to negotiate, but I think this is a good starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than further delay. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer. Although I am facing an inflation penalty, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. In the next round, I will try to find a compromise that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation penalty, I am offering a compromise. I have increased Bob's share compared to my initial offer, while also taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me. I am hoping Bob will see this as a fair deal and accept it.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what Bob thinks!"
