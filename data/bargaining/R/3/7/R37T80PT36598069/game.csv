60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose I take $60 and you take $40.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing value with each passing round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, I think your offer was a bit biased. How about we do 55-45? It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid losing value to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I'm looking for a slightly better split. How about $58 for me and $42 for you? This still gives us both a significant gain considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Hi Alice, I see we're getting closer. Considering the inflation, I think a 52-48 split is more than fair. Let's secure the deal before the money loses more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating into our potential gains.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - $55 for me and $45 for you. Let's close the deal and get something out of this.",Alice,5,
