I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself.  Let's see how Bob responds.  Remember, I'm trying to maximize my share, but also need to be careful about pushing him too far.  The inflation will start to affect me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for me than my previous offer.  I'm getting 2000, and while the inflation makes it worth less than what I was initially asking for, it's still better than getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other. It's also much better than the 1000 I would have received if I had rejected Bob's offer and then proposed a new split."
