"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the total""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I think it's still fair considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than my initial offer. I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I'd like to get a bit more. However, I don't want to prolong the game and risk losing more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
