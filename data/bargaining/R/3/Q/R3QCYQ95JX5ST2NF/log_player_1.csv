"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the cash.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the majority, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a better deal than what I initially proposed, and it's a fair compromise."
