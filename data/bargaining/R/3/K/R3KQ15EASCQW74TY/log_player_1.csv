"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is fairer, with me getting the larger share this time.  Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth 95% of its original value, which is $3,800.

I don't think this offer is fair, as I'm getting a smaller share than I proposed in the first round. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less in each of the previous two rounds), my gain of $3,800 in the second round is actually worth 90% of its original value, which is $3,420.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```"
