This is a tricky one! While it seems like Alice is getting a bad deal due to inflation, her offer is now heavily skewed in her favor. I'm betting she's getting desperate and will offer a larger share in the next round."

This is still too risky.  While time is running out, Alice's desperation is growing. She needs to offer a larger share soon or risk getting nothing."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 89.26% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take an even bigger share to offset the massive inflation loss! 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's risky, but at this point, the inflation is working strongly against both of us.  If I reject this offer, there's a good chance Alice will panic and offer an even worse deal in the last round. It's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all."
