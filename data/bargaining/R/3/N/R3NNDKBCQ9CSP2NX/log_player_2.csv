"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60% for me is a good starting point 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Your turn to be generous. This is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice's money is devaluing faster than Bob's (20% vs 10% per round).  It's in Bob's best interest to push for a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering slightly more than what Alice would get if she rejected this offer and made her own in the next round (550,000 now vs. a potential 600,000 that's been devalued by 20%), Bob creates a strong incentive for her to accept.
* **Finality:**  The ""final offer"" statement aims to add weight to the proposal and potentially make Alice reconsider her options more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway, a bit more for me 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking another round. If Bob rejects and makes a counter-offer in Round 4, even if Alice accepts a 45/55 split in his favor, the inflation will have eroded the value significantly.  
* **Uncertain Future:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. She might become more stubborn, pushing for an even less favorable deal. 
* **Bird in Hand:** It's often said, ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."" Accepting a decent offer now avoids the risk of ending up with a worse outcome later."
