"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than 40-60.  Let's try a slightly more even split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's revised offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll compare the offers as follows:

My original offer: 60 - 40 = 20% gain for me, 20% gain for Bob
Bob's revised offer: 45 - 55 = 10% gain for me, 15% gain for Bob

Considering the offers, I'll choose to reject Bob's revised offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try 55-45!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55, which is a slight increase from my original offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
