"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I need to consider that.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my share is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split this time, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I still need to consider the potential for future rounds and the fact that Bob is offering a higher share to himself.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
