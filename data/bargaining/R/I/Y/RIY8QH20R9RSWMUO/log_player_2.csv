"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick resolution. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Your 60/40 split isn't very fair to me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle? This is the best I'll offer, considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my initial offer was more than fair considering the inflation we both face. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but 55/45 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
After two rounds, Alice is sticking close to her initial offer, and the money is losing value quickly. Accepting a 45/55 split in round 3 is better than risking an even worse offer from Alice in round 4.
