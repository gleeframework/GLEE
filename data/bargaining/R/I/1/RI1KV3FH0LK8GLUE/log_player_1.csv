"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share, but I'm leaving a little for Bob to make him more likely to accept. I want to maximize my gains, but I also need to consider the risk of him rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I don't want to risk losing even more money in future rounds due to inflation.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a significant amount, and it avoids the risk of potentially getting nothing if we keep going."
