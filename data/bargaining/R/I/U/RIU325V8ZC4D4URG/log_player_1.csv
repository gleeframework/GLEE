"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, I'll get a slightly larger share to start.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70 dollars, which is a good starting point, and Bob will get 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 45:55 split, aiming for an even distribution considering the decreasing value of money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreasing value of money, I need to be more cautious. Considering the inflation, my gain of 55 is actually worth 49 dollars (55 * 0.89, since 10% less than 55), which is not bad, but I was hoping for a bit more.

However, Bob's offer is a good one, and it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
