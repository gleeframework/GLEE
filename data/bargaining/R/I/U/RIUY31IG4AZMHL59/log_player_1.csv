"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a little more since you rejected my first offer.  Let's split it 60/40 this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth 20% less this round, I'll try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to get a more balanced split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think 55/45 is a fairer split.""}

I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a 50/50 split."
