Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair offer to start. I propose keeping 90% and letting Bob have 10%.  This ensures a good start for me, while hopefully allowing Bob to feel like he's getting something, which might make him more likely to accept.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it is technically a fair offer by Bob's logic (he is getting 90 and I am getting 10), I am being severely disadvantaged by the inflation.  My 10 dollars is worth less than Bob's 90 dollars.  I will continue to play and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm still feeling the effects of inflation, but I need to make sure I get a good amount. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise.  I hope Bob will see that I'm trying to be reasonable, but also need to secure a good outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very tough situation.  I'm losing so much value to inflation, and Bob is becoming increasingly greedy.  5 dollars is barely worth anything at this point. However, I'm not going to give in just yet. I still have a few rounds left, and I need to keep fighting for a better deal.  I will reject this offer and see if I can negotiate something more favorable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I need to make a decisive move.  I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. While the inflation has significantly diminished the value of my earnings, I'm still trying to ensure a reasonable outcome. This offer is a significant concession from my previous proposal, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize the urgency of the situation and be willing to compromise."
