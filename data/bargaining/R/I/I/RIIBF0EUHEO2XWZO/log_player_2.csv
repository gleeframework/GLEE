I'm going for a more even split, hoping Alice will accept. Let's see what happens!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is getting a worse deal than in the first round, and I'm getting more.  It's a good deal for me, even with the slight chance that we could get to round four and I might get even more. But with inflation and the uncertainty of Alice's behavior, this is a safe bet."
