"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation rate difference. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept a deal where I get 20% of the money, especially since the inflation rate will hurt me more in the next round. I want a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need to ensure I get a good portion too, given the inflation rates.  ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still need to prioritize my own gains due to the inflation rate difference. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, this offer is better than what I previously proposed and still gives me a significant portion of the money. Considering the inflation rate, this seems like a reasonable deal."
