I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 
I'm going to offer Alice a bit less than she offered me, hoping she'll take it to avoid the risk of further inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less now, this offer is still better than the one I got in Round 1, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal from Alice."
