Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's my turn now. I'll take $55 and you get $45.  This is a better deal for me considering the inflation, but still gets us both some cash. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
