"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take more, huh? That's a bold move!

I'll think for a moment... Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is worth the same as it was in the first round, but Bob will get $60, which is worth 10% less than what he would have gotten in the first round.

Considering this, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You took 20 more than me last round, I'll give you 5 less this time. Your turn!""
}
```"
