"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can start with a clean slate. Your turn, Bob!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gained in the first round still worth the same, I'd like to get a better deal now.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 4000 for me and 6000 for him, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. I'll offer a slight increase to Bob's share, but still keep a significant portion for myself.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200
