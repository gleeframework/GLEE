"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer in the first round.  Since we both know about the inflation, I'm giving him a small amount hoping he'll accept rather than risk getting less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation makes this offer more appealing.  If I reject, I risk getting nothing in the next round. Accepting this ensures I get at least 5000, and with inflation, that amount is worth less in the future."
