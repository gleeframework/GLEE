"Round 1

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be reasonable. 50/50 is a fair split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the same as in round 1. Let's wrap this up - the clock is ticking, and it's hurting my returns! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a 50/50 split, Alice is getting a worse deal with each passing round due to the inflation impacting her.  It's unlikely she'll offer anything better, and I'd rather take the guaranteed $40 now than risk getting a worse outcome later."
