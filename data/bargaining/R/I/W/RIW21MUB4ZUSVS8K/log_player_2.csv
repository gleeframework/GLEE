Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers, 58-42 is a fair compromise.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't bluff, 52-48 is not your final offer. I'll take a bit less than before, 57-43. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I'm holding firm. Accepting 43% when we're past the halfway point is not ideal. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm betting Alice will crack before I do."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you're right. I'm willing to compromise slightly. 51-49, take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to show some flexibility while still aiming for a slight advantage.  I'm moving closer to her offer, but holding firm above 50%.  This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still emphasizing the shrinking pot due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 56-44 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The window of opportunity for a favorable deal is closing rapidly. While 44% isn't ideal, it's better than risking a worse outcome as inflation eats away at the pot. Alice seems determined to hold the advantage, and further negotiation at this point may yield even less favorable results."
