"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, keeping the majority for myself. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a quick deal and avoid inflation eating away at my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is becoming a real risk, and a 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
