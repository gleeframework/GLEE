"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80% for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. It's fair and we both get a good amount. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's effectively $4,500.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I can get more than $4,500 in the next round. 

```

Round 3

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less this round, but I'm still offering you a good deal. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 40/60. This is a fair offer considering the inflation, and it gives us both a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 73.1% of its original value, so it's effectively $7,310.
