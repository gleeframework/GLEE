"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This means I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that in my decision. In this case, my gain of $30 is equivalent to $33 in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll accept Bob's offer this time.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
