"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively balanced offer, with me getting 60% of the total and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not getting a better deal, but I'm also not getting a worse deal. However, Bob's offer is more balanced than mine, and it's a 50-50 split, which is fair. I'll accept this offer.
