"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting a slightly better offer now against the potential gains I might get in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. But I'm not giving up yet.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be even more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think about whether I can do better in the next round or if I should accept this offer.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is still in his favor, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a significant toll on my potential gains, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a little desperate, Bob. I need a better deal. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a more even split, but I'm still willing to compromise to try to get a better deal than Bob's previous offer."
