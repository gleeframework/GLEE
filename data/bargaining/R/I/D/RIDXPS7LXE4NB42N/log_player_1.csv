"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. It's a fair offer, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's too low and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob has turned the tables on me! Given that the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of 100,000 is actually worth 80,000, and Bob's gain of 900,000 is actually worth 720,000.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Given the continued inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80% of the original value).

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping to get a better deal now that I've rejected his previous offer."
