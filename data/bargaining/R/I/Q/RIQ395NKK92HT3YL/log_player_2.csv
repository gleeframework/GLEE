Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer, even though the value is decreasing with each round. By continuing to reject her offers, I'm signaling that I'm willing to risk it all for a better deal.  There's a risk Alice won't budge, but we're still early enough in the game to apply pressure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at this any further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a 50/50 split to show willingness to compromise, but also to establish a firm and fair position. This emphasizes that I'm willing to lose it all for a fair deal. It creates pressure on Alice, as continued rejection means risking a smaller share later or even nothing at all."
