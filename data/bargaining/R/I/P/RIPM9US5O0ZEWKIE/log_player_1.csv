Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too low for me. This feels like a fairer split that still accounts for the risk of inflation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
