,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the potential inflation. This offer is a fair starting point, but I'm hoping we can do better.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Considering the inflation and our previous offers, I believe a 50/50 split would be fair for both of us. It allows for flexibility in future rounds and ensures a balanced distribution of resources.",Alice,3,
