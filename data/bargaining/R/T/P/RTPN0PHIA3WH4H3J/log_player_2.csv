"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject the offer. Even though 1000 is something, it's worth risking it for a better deal. I'll be able to make a counter-offer in the next round, and the money will lose some of its value for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair. Let's both get a good amount and end this game.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40, and get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer my initial offer, it's clear Alice won't budge much. The money is losing value with each round, and 4000 is still a decent amount. I'll accept her offer."
