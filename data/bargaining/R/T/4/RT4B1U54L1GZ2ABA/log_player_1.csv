I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, given the inflation factor will benefit Bob more in the long run. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation, and I'm not going to let him! I'm going to hold out and see if he'll budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my share to 55, but I'm still holding firm.  The inflation is working in my favor now, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than Bob's last offer."
