"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable starting point, and I think it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll have to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than before, I'll have to be more cautious.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite unfavorable, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""You're not being generous, so I'll take the majority!""}

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm trying to take advantage of Bob's earlier stinginess and make a bold move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable this time. Since the money is worth less than before, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, and it's better than the 30-70 split Bob offered earlier.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
