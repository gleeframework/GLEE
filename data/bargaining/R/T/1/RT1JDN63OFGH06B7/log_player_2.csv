"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for both of us to secure a good portion of the money before it loses value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is reasonable, I believe I can get a better deal. The inflation rate is higher for Alice, so I'll try to push for a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a good portion, but the inflation rate for me is lower. I believe this split is fairer considering the circumstances. Let's secure some money before it loses too much value."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. However, the initial rounds are crucial for me due to the higher inflation rate. Let's meet in the middle â€“ this split ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I still believe I could get a slightly better deal, accepting this offer is the most pragmatic choice. The inflation rate is eating away at the value of the money rapidly, and continuing to negotiate risks losing even more. This split provides a substantial gain for both of us before the value depreciates further."
