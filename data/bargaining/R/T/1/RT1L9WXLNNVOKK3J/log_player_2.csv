"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I lose more from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, especially for Alice, I'm hoping she'll be willing to compromise more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in this round, so I've adjusted the offer accordingly. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting us both, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Alice, and her willingness to compromise, I think this is a reasonable offer. Since she stated it's her final offer, I don't want to risk going into another round where the value could decrease even further, potentially leading to an even worse outcome for me."
