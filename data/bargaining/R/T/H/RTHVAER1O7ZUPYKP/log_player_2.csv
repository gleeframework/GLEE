"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal where we both benefit, Bob. This offer ensures you get a sizable sum right now. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Besides, the money is only worth 10% less for me in the next round, so I'm not losing too much by waiting. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me. Since the money is worth 10% less to me now, I'll try to make up for it by asking for a bit more.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it in a way that's more fair to both of us, considering the inflation!""}\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for you. This is a strong offer considering the circumstances, and it guarantees you a good portion of the original sum. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. The money may be worth 19% less to me now, but I think I can still get a better deal. Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not ready to give in yet. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer. Since the money is worth even less to me now, I'll try to be a bit more aggressive in my proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I know the inflation is hurting me, but I'm not going to give up. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it!""}\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it now, or watch your share dwindle even further. I'm being more than fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. The money may be worth 34.39% less to me now, but I don't think I can get a better deal than this. Alice's offer is actually quite reasonable considering the inflation, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round.
