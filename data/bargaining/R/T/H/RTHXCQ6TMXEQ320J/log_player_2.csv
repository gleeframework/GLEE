"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice rejected the 50-50 split, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer a slightly skewed split to try to get more for myself.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still a 52-48 split, but considering the inflation, it's equivalent to a 53.67-46.33 split in the first round's money. I'll take it.
