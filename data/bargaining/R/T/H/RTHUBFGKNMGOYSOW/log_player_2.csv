Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but I'm open to negotiating more evenly later. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal.  10 dollars is not worth it to me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I want a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that.  I'm offering you a fair share, let's get this done.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a better deal than that. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'm not getting any better deals, so I'll take the 40. I don't want to risk getting nothing."
