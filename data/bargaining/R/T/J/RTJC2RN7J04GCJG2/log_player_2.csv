# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, I'm being generous here 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is correct that I'm losing value, but her offer is still not good.  I need to convey that time is running out for both of us, and she's risking getting nothing at all."

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is getting ridiculous! Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation situation. I need to hold firm and show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even if it means risking everything."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting absurd!  Inflation is hurting me, but if we don't agree soon, we'll BOTH get nothing! This is my final offer - take it or leave it!""}

# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not impressed 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  I'm extremely unhappy with this offer, but I have no choice. If I reject it, there's a very real chance Alice will run out the clock, leaving us both with nothing.  It's better to take a significantly reduced amount than nothing at all.  Alice has played this very strategically."
