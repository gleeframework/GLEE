"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. I believe this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  Let's try 60/40 in my favor this time, and we can both come out ahead. ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where I'm getting a decent deal. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though I'm getting less than I wanted, it's better than the alternative.  Since the money is worth less each round, and I don't know how much more it will depreciate, it's better to take what I can get now."
