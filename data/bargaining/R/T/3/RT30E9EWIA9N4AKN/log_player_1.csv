"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the higher amount this round, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're not satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'm not satisfied with the 40/60 split, as I'd like to get a higher share. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take a higher amount, but I want 55% of the remaining money. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle.""

```

Your turn, Bob!"

  ""alice_gain"": 440000,
  ""bob_gain"": 560000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Can you meet me at 55%?""
