"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and take the larger share, I'm the one making the first offer 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While this offer seems fair at face value, the game mechanics incentivize me to try and get a better deal. By rejecting, I can make a proposal in the next round and potentially secure a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this time. I'll take the larger share, but I'm open to negotiating in the future.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less than before, but still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I still believe I could potentially get a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt, and Alice's offer is still relatively fair. Accepting now means I secure a decent amount, while rejecting could lead to a much smaller share due to the increasing inflation."
