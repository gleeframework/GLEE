"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the funds fairly. I propose we divide it 60/40 in favor of you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's always good to try and maximize your own gains, especially in the first round!  Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, but I think we can do better. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor this time. It's a more balanced way to start the game.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I've adjusted our proposal. Let's divide the funds 52.5/47.5 in favor of you. This maintains a fair balance while accounting for the diminishing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd love to keep pushing for more, Alice's offer is a good compromise considering inflation.  It's a fair gain for me, and I don't want to risk losing out in the next round."
