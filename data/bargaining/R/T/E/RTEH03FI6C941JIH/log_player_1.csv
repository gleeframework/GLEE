"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%. This should hopefully be enough to convince him to accept, especially considering the inflation rate will hit him harder than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial proposal, even with the inflation factor considered. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my share by a smaller amount this time, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. I'm also taking into account the inflation effect, which will be more significant for him than for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than the previous rounds, the inflation is hitting him hard and his offer is still not equitable, especially with the significant inflation impacting his portion. I will reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm reducing my share further, but I'm aiming for a more balanced division. Bob's inflation is drastically reducing his gains, and I want to ensure he gets a decent share to incentivize him to accept. This offer is more appealing than his previous offers while still providing a significant share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the steep inflation impacting Bob, his offer is still not acceptable. I will continue to negotiate for a fairer split, as we both stand to lose significantly more with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm further reducing my share, hoping to entice Bob to accept. The inflation rate is hitting him very hard, and I believe offering a larger portion to him is the only way to reach an agreement before we both lose too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his previous ones, it's still not a fair split considering the drastic inflation impacting him. The money he's receiving is drastically devalued, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal before we both lose everything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

This round, I'm making a significant compromise to try and incentivize Bob to accept. We're both losing money rapidly, and I believe this offer is a fair compromise given the circumstances. I'm hoping that he realizes that further negotiation will only lead to us both getting less."
