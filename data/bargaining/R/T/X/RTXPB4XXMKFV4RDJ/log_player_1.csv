"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. My gain of $3,000 is too low, and I'd like to aim for a higher amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I want, but I'm still not there. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth significantly less than in the first round, so I'll have to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is slightly better than my previous offer, and it's getting closer to what I was aiming for.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
