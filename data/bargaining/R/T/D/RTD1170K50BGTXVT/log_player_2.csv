"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. Let's meet in the middle.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's important we settle this soon. Time is literally money for you! I'm proposing a slightly better split for me to reflect that. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's wrap this up. I'm taking a small step back to show I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be settled now. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While her offer is slightly better, accepting a near 50/50 split when my money is worth significantly less is not in my best interest. I need to show firmness to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5400, ""alice_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm being more than fair considering the circumstances. Accept this offer, or I'm digging in my heels.""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this stage, showing strength and resolve is crucial.  Alice needs to understand I'm not going to be pressured into a bad deal. Offering 54/46 is a strong counter-offer. It's still a compromise from my ideal split, but acknowledges the shrinking pot from my perspective.  The message aims to convey a sense of urgency and seriousness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm holding firm.  You're losing more with every passing round.  Let's be sensible and end this now.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but Alice is playing hardball.  Her offer is barely better than before, but she's labeled it her ""final offer."" This significantly increases the risk of her sticking to her guns and me losing even more to inflation.  

While not ideal, accepting gives me a slight edge over a 50/50 split, which is likely the best I can hope for at this point. The potential losses from further rounds outweigh the small potential gains from holding out."
