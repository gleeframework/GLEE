**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are barely budging. While the deal is getting worse with each round, accepting a 44/56 split when we're past the halfway point is not in our best interest. There's a good chance Alice will crack and offer a much larger share soon to avoid getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you a larger share than what you'd get if you reject this and win the next round. Don't be greedy, this is your best shot.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time to turn up the pressure. By offering Alice 48%, we're giving her a slightly better deal than she'd get if she rejected this and won the next round (her 58% would then be worth significantly less due to inflation).  This might be enough to convince her to accept and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
