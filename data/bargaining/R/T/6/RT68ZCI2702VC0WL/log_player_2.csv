Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 5% less for Alice, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 38.75 
# Alice gain: 61.25 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the changing value of the money due to inflation. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Alice's offer is slightly more favorable to me than my previous offer, I'll accept this one.
