"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk too 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since I'll be getting $200,000, which is worth 80% of what I would have gotten in the first round, I'll have to decide whether it's worth it.

For now, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is biting, and I need to be strategic!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the lion's share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, but I'll give you a tiny bit 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 51.2% of its original value, $100,000 is actually a relatively small amount.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower earnings. So, I'll accept this offer.
