"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand the inflation affects you more, but your last offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 50/50 split. This is fair and ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
