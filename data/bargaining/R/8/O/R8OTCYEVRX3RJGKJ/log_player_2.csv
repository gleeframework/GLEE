"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A slight advantage for me considering the inflation we face. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand the inflation affects you more, but your last offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 50/50 split. This is fair and ensures we both benefit.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about fairness. However, we need to factor in the inflation. My offer is a compromise, slightly better for me due to the value decrease. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
