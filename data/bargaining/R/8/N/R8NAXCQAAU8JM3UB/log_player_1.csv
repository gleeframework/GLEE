I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split. I figure I should get the lion's share since I'm the one making the offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better than getting nothing if I reject and Bob makes a less favorable proposal in the next round."
