Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 60/40 split.  This reflects the fact that the money devalues faster for me, making each round more critical for me than for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50/50 split to demonstrate my willingness to be fair.  If you reject this, it seems like you're just trying to stall until the money is worthless.  Let's be sensible and end this.
