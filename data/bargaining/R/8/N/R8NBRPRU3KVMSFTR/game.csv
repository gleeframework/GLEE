400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 60/40 split.  This reflects the fact that the money devalues faster for me, making each round more critical for me than for you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I still need a significant share to account for the devaluation.  Let's split it 65/35. I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits both of us before the money becomes completely worthless.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50/50 split to demonstrate my willingness to be fair.  If you reject this, it seems like you're just trying to stall until the money is worthless.  Let's be sensible and end this.",Bob,4,
