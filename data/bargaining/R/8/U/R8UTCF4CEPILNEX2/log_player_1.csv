# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI rejected Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to try to get more value out of the deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI decided to accept Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I think this is the best deal I can get.
