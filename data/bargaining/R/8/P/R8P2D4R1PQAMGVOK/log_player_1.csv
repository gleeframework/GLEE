"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
``` 

This is a fair starting point, as it splits the money equally. Since the money depreciates for Bob, he will likely be more motivated to accept this offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is slightly better for me, it's not enough to make up for the fact that he's getting a larger share. Since the money is depreciating for Bob, I can likely get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to 5500, taking advantage of the fact that the money Bob receives is worth less each round due to inflation. This offer still favors me, but it's not overly greedy, which might lead to Bob accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd ideally prefer more, Bob's offer is getting increasingly attractive.  He's losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, and this offer is close to a 50/50 split in terms of the real value of the money.  Accepting seems like the best strategy at this point."
