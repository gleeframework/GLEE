"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my first offer. I'm taking the lion's share, but leaving Bob with a small amount to hopefully entice him to accept in the first round. I'm banking on him not understanding the inflation factor yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  With inflation, my gains are significantly reduced, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in future rounds. It's better to secure $1000 now, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
