Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking almost everything, leaving Bob with a single dollar. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Bob accepts, I win big. If he rejects, we go to the next round, and he gets to make the offer. The risk is that he might take a larger share of the money in the next round.  However, the inflation factor is unknown, so there's a chance that the money will be worth less to him in the future. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though Bob is getting an equal share, I'm still getting $500,000.  It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk losing any more money in the next round, especially since inflation is hitting Bob harder."
