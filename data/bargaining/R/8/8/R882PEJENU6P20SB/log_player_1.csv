  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you think?""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small share, let's negotiate more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to take a larger share in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed in your favor. I'd like to negotiate further.""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's way too low for me. I'm not going to accept a 1% share.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as it's not even close to a fair share. I'll try to negotiate further. It's now Bob's turn again!"

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as it's completely unacceptable. I'm not going to let him take 95% of the money and leave me with a tiny fraction. It's now Bob's turn again!"

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's an insult. I'm not going to accept a 1% share. You're not even trying to negotiate fairly.""
}

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm not going to make another offer that's going to get rejected. I'm going to make a very final offer that's as close to 50-50 as possible. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 499999,
  ""bob_gain"": 500001,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm not going to make another concession. Take it or leave it.""
