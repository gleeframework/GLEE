Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to significantly hurt Bob's potential gains.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob still receives a significant sum, even with the inflation penalty.  

Here's why rejecting the offer is risky:

* **Further Reduced Gains:** Another round means Bob's share is worth even less.  He's unlikely to propose an offer Alice accepts that's significantly better than her current one.
* **Alice's Leverage:** Alice knows Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation. She's likely to offer even less in subsequent rounds.

It's a tough decision, but taking the sure thing now mitigates further losses."
