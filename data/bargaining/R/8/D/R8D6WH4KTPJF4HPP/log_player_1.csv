"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer. However, it's still a decent split. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
