"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try a different split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think 50/50 is the fairest way to split this. Let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 19% less for me and 36% less for Alice compared to the first round, I think accepting the 50/50 split is a good deal. Further rounds will only decrease the value of the money, so it's best to accept now."
