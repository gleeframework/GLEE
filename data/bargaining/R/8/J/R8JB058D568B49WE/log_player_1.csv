Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm taking a slightly greedy approach, aiming for 90% of the money.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to secure a large portion early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the money. Inflation is a serious factor, and I don't want to risk getting less in future rounds."
