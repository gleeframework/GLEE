"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and it's a good way to test the waters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good offer! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. Maybe I can get a better split or more money from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 40/60, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still hoping for a better deal""}

I'm offering Bob a 45/55 split, which is a bit more generous than his previous offer. Let's see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm getting closer to my target! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'm starting to run out of options. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not happy about it. I was hoping to get a better deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse offer."
