"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets the remaining 30%. This way, I'll get a significant portion of the money upfront, but Bob will still get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is for 40% of the remaining money, which is worth 90% of the original amount (due to the 10% inflation), I'll calculate the actual amount he's offering me:

40% of 90% of $100 = 0.4 * 0.9 * 100 = $36

And the amount he's keeping for himself:

60% of 90% of $100 = 0.6 * 0.9 * 100 = $54

So, Bob is offering me $36 and keeping $54. I'll accept this offer.
