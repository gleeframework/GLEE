"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, let's negotiate 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6000 is now worth $5400, and Bob's $4000 is still worth $4000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll accept this offer for now, as it's a better deal than walking away.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
