"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my gain is decreasing with each round, but I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll try to make a more advantageous offer. Here's my proposal:
