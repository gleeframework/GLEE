Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is not fair. How about we do 55/45? The money won't be worth as much if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
