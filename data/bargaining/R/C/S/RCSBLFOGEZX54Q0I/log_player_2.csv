"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob, but let's do it quickly. Time is money! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer.  Although the initial offer seems fair, I need to consider the inflation factor.  I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal and we can both walk away happy. We don't want to risk losing everything due to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the even split offer, but time is working against you. I'll take a bit more, but let's settle this before the inflation eats away at your share. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. The inflation is starting to hurt my gains significantly, and while I would prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is reasonable, and accepting it will secure some of the money."
