# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. With the inflation rates, I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55% for me and 45% for you is a fair deal.""}"

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hitting me harder, but your previous offer was still too low. Let's settle this; I'll take a smaller cut than my first offer. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI think I can still get a better deal considering the inflation rates. Alice is losing more value each round, so I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your end, I believe 58% for me and 42% for you is a more reasonable split now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the inflation is only hurting both of us. I'm lowering my offer again to show I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, especially on Alice, and the fact that she's willing to compromise by lowering her offer again, I think this deal is reasonable at this stage. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome due to the rapidly decreasing value of the money. It's time to accept and secure the deal before the inflation devalues the money further."
