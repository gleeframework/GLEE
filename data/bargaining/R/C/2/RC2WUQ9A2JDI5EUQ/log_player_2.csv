"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal divides the money 650000 for me and 350000 for you. I suggest accepting it before the value decreases.

# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice is offering a pretty good deal, but it's worth seeing if I can get a better one. I'll reject and see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd like.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a division of $597500 for me and $402500 for you. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for the decreasing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 402500 
# Alice gain: 597500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is offering a bit more than what I proposed in the last round, and the value of the money is decreasing. It's a good compromise, and accepting will guarantee me a significant amount."
