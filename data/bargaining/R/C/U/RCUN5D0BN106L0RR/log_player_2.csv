"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's a good starting point, but Alice's offer doesn't take into account the fact that the money is worth less to both of us with each passing round. I'll counter with a proposal that reflects that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I think we should both get more, considering the money is worth less each round. This offer takes that into account while still being fair."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be more to compensate for the smaller decrease in value. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still not taking the full impact of the inflation on my share into account. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. The inflation is hitting us both hard, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to deal with that."" 
}
