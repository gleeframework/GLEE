"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the new offer carefully.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits of accepting this offer.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Considering the reduced value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. This offer seems reasonable given the circumstances.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
