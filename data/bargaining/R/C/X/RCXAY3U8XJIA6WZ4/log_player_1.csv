"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll get 60% of the original value, which is 600,000, but due to inflation, it's now worth 480,000.
Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so 550,000 is now worth 522,500.

Considering the reduced values, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer. Considering the reduced values due to inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly higher percentage to account for the decreased purchasing power.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```

This way, I'll get 52% of the remaining value, and Bob will get 48%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain is worth 48.8% less than the original 600,000, which is 312,000.
Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than the original 550,000, which is 471,525.

  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
