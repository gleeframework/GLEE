"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split that favors me slightly.  Let's get this done quickly before inflation eats away at our gains!""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more considering the risks and potential benefits. Let's see if you can do better. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than the initial 9000 I proposed.  I'm willing to take the risk of negotiating further. The inflation is a significant factor, but I believe I can secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise. I've lowered my offer to 7000, which is still more than your previous proposal. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Time is running out -  let's make a deal!""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you 7000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try to find a better compromise. Time is running out, but I'm still hopeful we can make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from round 2, it's still far below what I believe is fair. I am determined to secure a better deal for myself, and I am confident I can achieve a more favorable outcome. Time is running out, but I believe I can still reach a compromise that benefits us both."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""We're running out of time!  I've lowered my offer again to 5500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's the best way for us to both walk away with something. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you 5500, but I'm willing to meet you at 5000. I think this is a fair split, and I'm willing to take the risk that we might both end up with nothing if we don't make a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While the inflation has greatly reduced the value of the money, I've reached a point where it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer than risk getting nothing.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and accepting now ensures we both walk away with something.  The risk of further negotiation is too high at this point."
