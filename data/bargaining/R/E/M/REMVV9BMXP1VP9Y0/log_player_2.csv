Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, you should be happy with 35%! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway.  Let's split it 45/55. This is a fair deal considering the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob! Inflation is eating away at your share. Take this offer before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, accepting is the best option at this point. Inflation has reduced the value of my potential gains significantly, and rejecting this offer risks getting nothing at all in the next round."
