"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. We can adjust as we go.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a larger share, but I'm not giving it away yet! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While Bob's offer seems more generous, I'm losing 30% of my potential gains due to inflation.
* **Power Shift:** Bob is showing he has leverage with the inflation effect, and I need to push back to avoid getting a worse deal later.
* **Strategic Thinking:** By rejecting, I force Bob to propose again, and I can see if he's willing to offer more.

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I'll need to consider the inflation effect carefully and make a counter-offer that's fair but still secures a good share of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a better offer than the last one. We both need to consider the effects of inflation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** I'm still losing value due to inflation, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of limited rounds.
* **Compromise:** My offer is a compromise from the initial 90/10 split, but I'm not going to give up too much at this point.
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a desire for fairness and acknowledges the need to consider inflation. This is a subtle way to remind Bob that he should make a more generous offer.

**Strategic Thinking:**

* I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not be taken advantage of.
* By proposing a split closer to 70/30, I hope to push Bob toward a more equitable offer.
* This round will provide more information about Bob's negotiating style and his willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 50/50 and avoid further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The combined effect of inflation is hitting hard now. My potential gains are significantly reduced, and Bob's even more so.
* **50/50 Split:** While not ideal, a 50/50 split is a fair and predictable outcome, especially considering the diminishing returns.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are now halfway through the rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing.
* **Predictability:** A 50/50 split avoids further rounds of negotiation and uncertainty, which might lead to a worse outcome. 

**Decision:**

Accepting the 50/50 offer is the most logical choice at this stage. While I'm losing out on a larger share due to inflation and Bob's initial offer, it's the best way to secure a substantial amount of money and avoid the risk of getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
