Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The inflation is eating away at any potential gain. Let's just split it evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### 

I'll explain my reasoning:

In Round 1, I rejected Alice's offer because I thought I could get a better deal, considering the inflation impact.

In Round 2, I made a counteroffer that I thought was more balanced, but Alice rejected it.

In Round 3, Alice's offer was still not favorable to me, so I rejected it.

In Round 4, I made another counteroffer, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's end, but she rejected it again.

Now, in Round 5, Alice is offering an even split. Given the significant impact of inflation on both of us, I think this is a reasonable offer. The money is worth 18.55% less to me than in the first round, and 59.04% less to Alice. I don't think I can get a better deal than this, so I'll accept the offer and end the game."
