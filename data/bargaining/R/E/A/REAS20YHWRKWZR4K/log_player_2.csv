"Round 1

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your generosity, Bob, but I think we can find a more equitable split. Let's try 55/45 this time. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still hoping for a more balanced deal. I'm willing to go up to 60/40.  Let's work together to find a solution before time runs out. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is better than Alice's previous 55/45 proposal, it's still not good enough for Bob. Time is a factor, but Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation far more. Bob can likely secure a better deal in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a risky move, but Bob needs to start applying significant pressure. By framing this as his ""final offer,"" he's hoping to make Alice realize the situation's urgency.  She's losing value rapidly with each passing round. There's a chance she'll accept out of fear of getting a worse deal later or even nothing at all."
