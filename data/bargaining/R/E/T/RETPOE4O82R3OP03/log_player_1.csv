"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more realistic, Alice.  I'm feeling generous today. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems generous on the surface, the impact of inflation is significant.  Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Inflation Impact:** Bob loses 20% of the value each round. This means his offer is less appealing than it looks.  
* **Future Leverage:** As the rounds progress, Bob's position weakens faster than mine.  I have a better chance of getting a more favorable deal by waiting.
* **Targeting a Fairer Split:** My goal is to achieve a split that's closer to even after accounting for inflation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""It's important we settle this quickly, Bob.  This offer benefits us both in the long run.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:** I've adjusted my offer slightly downwards to account for the inflation affecting both of us. 
* **Pressuring with Time:** My message is designed to remind Bob that time is running out and each round makes the potential gains less valuable.
* **Aiming for a Favorable Split:** I'm still aiming for a split that leans slightly in my favor, recognizing that Bob's position weakens faster over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money Alice, but so is a fair deal. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is feeling the pressure, but I can't accept this offer. Here's why:

* **Still Favoring Bob:** Even with the inflation factored in, this deal still gives Bob a larger share of the original $10,000.
* **Inflation Advantage:** My inflation rate is lower. Time is more on my side, and I can afford to wait for a better offer. 
* **Holding Out for More:** I believe I can secure a deal closer to a 50/50 split (after inflation adjustments) if I remain patient."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""This is a very fair offer, Bob, especially considering the time pressure. Let's be smart and take it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Fairness and Urgency:**  I've nudged my offer slightly closer to a 50/50 split to appear more agreeable while still aiming for a slight advantage. 
* **Highlighting Time Pressure:** My message emphasizes the need for a quick resolution, playing on Bob's increasing losses due to inflation.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  I'm not conceding too much ground yet, as I believe Bob will be more open to compromise in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's stop this dance. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to resolve this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Deal:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair.
* **Inflation Impact:**  While I could potentially push for a slightly better split in later rounds, the inflation means that any potential gains are rapidly diminishing.  
* **Time Pressure:** We are now past the halfway point. Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of both of us walking away with nothing. 
 
It's a good deal under the circumstances. Let's take it!"
