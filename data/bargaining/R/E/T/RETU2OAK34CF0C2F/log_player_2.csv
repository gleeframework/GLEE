"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, we can negotiate later 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation factor. Rejecting allows me to make the proposal next round and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's make this quick and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to account for inflation 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation has taken a significant toll. It's better to accept this offer than risk losing even more in the next round."
