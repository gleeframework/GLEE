Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 50/50 split seems fair, I'm willing to gamble that Bob will offer me a slightly better deal in the next round to avoid losing even more to inflation."
