"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This offer won't be as good next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this. Let's meet in the middle while it's still worthwhile for you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out! This is my final offer. Let's end this before we both lose out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a fair deal. Take it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are really starting to hurt. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for me. 

Let's break it down:

* **Current offer:** 400,000
* **Value after another rejection (assuming a similar offer next round):** ~320,000 (and decreasing rapidly)

It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting is the most logical choice in this scenario.
