"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take this as a sign of good faith.  Let's see what you propose next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's far too generous in Alice's favor. While it seems like a good faith offer, the disparity in gains is too large to ignore, especially considering the rapid inflation we're facing. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the initial offer, Alice, but let's be realistic. This is a chance for both of us to benefit. I propose a more balanced split. What do you say?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get a decent amount as well.  If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both end up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is right about the risk of ending up with nothing, and her offer is getting closer to reasonable. However, the split is still significantly skewed in her favor, especially considering the faster rate at which the money is losing value for her. I need to push for a more equitable outcome."
