"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $30 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's actually worth $28.50.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, especially since I know the money is worth less for me due to inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a bigger share, but I think it's fair given the inflation. Accept and we can end the game.""
