"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what I can get with a bit of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better! Let's try 60/40 in my favor. This is a good starting point for a fair deal, considering I'm taking the risk of rejecting your previous offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is too skewed. How about 55/45 in my favor? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a better split, with inflation biting into my gains, accepting this offer is the best choice.  The difference between 4000 and 4500 is not significant enough to risk further negotiation."
