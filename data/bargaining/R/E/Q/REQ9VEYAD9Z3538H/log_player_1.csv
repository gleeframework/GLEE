"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can end this!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and giving Bob $4,000, which is a 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take half, you can have the other half. It's simple. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually worth $4,500.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, especially since I'm already taking a hit from inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90%), so I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. Take the majority, but I need something for myself.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share. Consider it a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1%), so it's actually worth $2,916.

I'm not thrilled with the idea of taking only $2,916, but I'm not sure I want to risk waiting for a better offer. Considering the offer is a compromise, I'll accept it.
