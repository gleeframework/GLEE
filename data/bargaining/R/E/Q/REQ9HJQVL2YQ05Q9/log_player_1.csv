"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a fairly generous split in the first round.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  If I reject it, Bob will get to make the next offer and his money will be worth even less, while mine stays the same. It's a good deal for me considering the circumstances."
