"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor, 55/45 is still quite fair considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation affects me, but your offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I think 58/42 is a reasonable adjustment 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly chipping away at the potential gains while using the inflation against me.  I need to hold strong for a better offer, but I need to be mindful that time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My share keeps shrinking, and you're not being realistic. I'm offering a compromise, again. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm expressing some frustration with Bob to see if I can nudge him towards a more reasonable position.  I'm also framing this offer with some finality to add pressure as we're now past the halfway point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm not going to give in. 60/40 is my new offer, take it before it gets worse for you 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is getting dangerous, but Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation.  He's gone back to his initial offer, which is completely unacceptable now. I need to hold my ground, but I'll likely have to make a significant concession soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's stop wasting time.  50/50.  This is fair, and it stops us both from losing everything. Don't be greedy.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm going with a strong, emotionally charged message and a 50/50 split.  This highlights the risk to Bob as well if we don't settle this now.  It's a significant concession from my previous positions, but the shrinking pot means I need to be realistic.  It's better to take a smaller share than nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You should have taken one of my previous offers. Now, I'm increasing my share. 65/35 is the new deal 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is outrageous! Bob is clearly trying to bully me into submission. I'm now past the point where I can expect a decent outcome, but I absolutely refuse to be bullied into accepting such an unfair deal. I'm hoping Bob realizes he's pushing too far and I might call his bluff. It's a huge gamble, but taking a terrible deal out of fear sets a bad precedent."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.  We're running out of time, and I won't accept anything less.  It's time to be realistic.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm drawing a line in the sand. I'm accepting a tough compromise that's heavily skewed in Bob's favor, but I can't let him walk all over me.  The ""final offer"" message and the reduced time add pressure. If he rejects this, I'll likely have to accept an even worse deal in the later rounds to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm increasing my share again. 70/30, take it or we'll both lose everything 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This is a brutal outcome, but I have no leverage left.  Bob knows I'm desperate to avoid getting nothing. If I reject this, he'll likely push for an even larger share in the next round, and I'll be forced to accept even less.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
