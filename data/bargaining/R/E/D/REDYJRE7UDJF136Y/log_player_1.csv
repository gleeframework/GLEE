"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, the effective values are:

* My gain: 60% of $100 = $60, now worth 80% of that due to inflation = $48
* Bob's gain: 40% of $100 = $40, now worth 90% of that due to inflation = $36

Bob's offer is:
* My gain: 30
* Bob's gain: 70

Since my effective gain in this offer is $30, which is less than the $48 I could have gotten in the previous round, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
