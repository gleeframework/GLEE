I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, hoping that Bob will accept to avoid further rounds.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, the inflation is really starting to hurt. Accepting this offer will give me a good chunk of money, and the longer I wait, the less it will be worth."
