"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars, leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

After calculating the value of the money, I realize that the 40 dollars I would get is worth 94% of the original 40 dollars (since it's 5% less due to inflation). Similarly, the 60 dollars Bob would get is worth 90% of the original 60 dollars (since it's 10% less due to inflation).

Considering this, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering to take 55 dollars, leaving 45 dollars for Bob."
