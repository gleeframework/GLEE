Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly.  I want to see how Bob responds and how he values the money, given the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, and even though the inflation rate has decreased the value of the money I would gain,  I think I can do better. I'm going to reject and hope to make a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to lower my gain slightly to try and find a middle ground.  I think Bob is motivated by getting the majority of the money, but I want to make sure I'm not losing out too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my initial offer, and the inflation is really starting to hit. I'm going to reject again and see if I can get him to budge a little.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to compromise to avoid a scenario where we both get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to lower my gain again, hoping to make a more appealing offer to Bob.  The inflation is really starting to hurt, so I need to get a deal done soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough, and the inflation is making things worse with each passing round. I'm going to reject his offer again and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to lower my gain one more time. We are running out of rounds, and I need to secure some money before the inflation erodes it further. This offer is still more appealing than Bob's last offer, and I hope he sees the urgency of coming to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but the inflation is really starting to hurt. I'm going to reject his offer again and try to get a better deal in the next round. There are only a few rounds left, and I need to secure a good deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a last-ditch effort.  The inflation is incredibly high, and I don't want to lose everything.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point, and I hope Bob understands the urgency of the situation."
