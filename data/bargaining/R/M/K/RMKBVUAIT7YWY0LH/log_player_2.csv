Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While her offer is getting slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm serious and willing to risk it all to get a fairer deal. The inflation is hurting, but I'm hoping she'll get nervous as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my guns. 50/50 is the only fair deal. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the pressure is mounting for both of us. Alice needs to realize that her stalling tactics won't work forever.
* **Strong stance:** By sticking to my previous offer and using firm language, I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting an even split. This might make Alice more willing to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While the inflation is hurting, accepting anything less than 50% at this stage would be a significant loss. It's a gamble, but I'm betting on Alice valuing getting something over nothing."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're really losing value here, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use psychological pressure, highlighting the impact of inflation. However, her offer is only marginally better and still significantly favors her. It's a waiting game now.  I'm betting she'll fold under pressure before I do, especially as we get closer to the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out. This is my final offer, let's be done with this.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  While I'm aiming for 50/50, offering a slight concession shows flexibility and might be the push Alice needs to settle. 
* **Deadline Pressure:** We are getting dangerously close to the end. Offering a compromise now might be more appealing to Alice than risking getting nothing at all.
* **Finality:**  Calling this my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and seriousness. It signals to Alice that I'm unwilling to budge further, and she needs to decide if this is her best option."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're really running out of time, this is a good deal for you considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's painful to accept anything less than 50%, but Alice is clearly playing hardball and time is my biggest enemy now.  Accepting this offer secures me something, which is better than the increasing risk of getting nothing at all if I continue to reject her offers."
