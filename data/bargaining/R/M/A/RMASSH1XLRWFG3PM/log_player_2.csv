"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince it's the first round and the offer is to split the money evenly, I think it's a fair deal. I'll accept the offer and end the game here.\n\n(Also, considering the 10% inflation per round, it's better to accept a good offer early on rather than risking a worse offer in future rounds.)\n\nLet me know if I'm correct, or if I need to proceed to the next round!"
