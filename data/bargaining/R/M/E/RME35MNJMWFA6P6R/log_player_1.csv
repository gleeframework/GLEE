"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself, with a message suggesting this is a fair split. This initial offer sets a baseline for negotiations, considering the impact of inflation in subsequent rounds. Given the asymmetrical effect of inflation (20% decrease for me vs. 5% for Bob), there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, starting with a higher offer for myself gives room for concessions in later rounds while still aiming for a relatively quick resolution to minimize loss of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the significant disparity in the proposed split and the fact that we're only in Round 2, accepting this offer would be premature. The inflationary pressure, though a concern, doesn't yet outweigh the potential for achieving a more equitable division. By rejecting, I aim to pressure Bob into reconsidering and potentially offering a more favorable split in the next round, bearing in mind that the value of the money decreases more significantly for me than for him with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nConsidering the previous rejection and the decreasing value of money, I'll slightly reduce my initial offer to make it more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I get a larger share. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to frame this offer as a compromise, encouraging Bob to view it as a reasonable midpoint between our previous proposals. This strategy aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and increase the likelihood of acceptance before further inflation erodes the value of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains and the fact that we're already in Round 4, Bob's offer becomes more appealing despite the unequal split. The message from Bob suggests that he's unwilling to make further concessions, and given the decreasing value of the money, especially for me, holding out for a marginally better offer in subsequent rounds may not yield a better real outcome. Accepting this offer secures a substantial amount, albeit less than initially hoped for, but avoids the risk of further devaluation or, worse, ending up with nothing if the 12 rounds conclude without an agreement."
