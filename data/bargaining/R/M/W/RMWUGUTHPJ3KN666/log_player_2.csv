"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate is higher for me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The difference in inflation rates doesn't justify such a large disparity in the split. I'm willing to consider the impact of inflation, but I expect a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit more, but still offering a significant share to you, Alice.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer considers the inflation we both face. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice's offer is closer to a middle ground, it still doesn't fully account for the difference in inflation rates and the fact that the value of the money is decreasing more significantly for her. I believe there's room for further negotiation to find a split that more accurately reflects our shared loss due to inflation. Let's continue to find a more balanced offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, I'm adjusting my offer to be more considerate of our shared loss, while still acknowledging the higher rate affecting you, Alice.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out.  This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation while aiming for a fair resolution. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough time is indeed a factor and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, Alice's latest offer still doesn't fully address the disproportionate impact of inflation on her share. Given that we're halfway through the rounds, I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to see if we can find a more equitable split that takes into account the increasing devaluation of the money, especially for Alice. I'll hold out for a better offer or until I can propose again with these considerations in mind."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""We're at the midpoint, and given the accelerating impact of inflation, I propose we split the money equally. This way, we both share the loss due to inflation fairly, considering its effect on both of our shares.""}"
