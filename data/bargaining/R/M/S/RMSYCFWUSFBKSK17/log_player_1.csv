"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gets $38 (40% of $96.50)
* Bob gets $57.80 (60% of $96.50)

Considering the decreasing value of money, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept Bob's offer.
