"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a pretty standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, that's a pretty lopsided offer from Bob! I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving him 700,000. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a 55-45 split, which I think is a fairer deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get closer to the 60-40 split he wanted in the first round! I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively even split and I don't want to risk going into the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
