"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept and we can be done early!""
}
```

This offer is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, let's see what happens next! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer from Bob!

I'll accept his proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
