"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I believe my contributions are more significant, let's be reasonable.""
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Rejection:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. Rejecting it signals that Bob is willing to play strategically. 
* **Turning the Tables:**  Bob's counter-offer flips the script, asking for the larger share. This tests Alice's greed and willingness to negotiate.
* **Time Pressure:** Bob knows that the longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to him due to the higher inflation rate he faces. He needs to incentivize Alice to settle quickly.
* **Message:** The message aims to introduce a subjective element, implying that Bob deserves more, without directly shutting down negotiations.  

This offer attempts to find a balance between assertiveness and a willingness to compromise, taking into account the time pressure and Alice's potential motivations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer, but it's still not a good deal for Bob. Let's analyze:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob. Waiting even longer significantly hurts his potential gains.
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice moved closer to a 50/50 split, indicating she understands Bob's unwillingness to accept a heavily uneven deal.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** By rejecting this offer, Bob signals that he's willing to risk it all in the final round. This puts pressure on Alice, potentially leading to a more favorable offer in the next round, where she'll want to avoid walking away with nothing. 

It's a risky move, but Bob needs to push for a better outcome in the final round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it. Let's end this now.""
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Final Round Pressure:**  This is the last round. If Alice rejects, both get nothing. This creates enormous pressure to reach a deal.
* **Strong but Negotiable Stance:**  Bob's offer is still slightly in his favor, reflecting the earlier rounds' dynamics. However, it's a significant concession from his previous 60/40 ask.
* **Clear Ultimatum:** The message removes any ambiguity. Alice knows this is her last chance to get anything. This decisive language can push her towards acceptance.

This offer aims to maximize Bob's gains while acknowledging the final round's high stakes. By offering a reasonable but firm deal, Bob increases his chances of securing a win."
