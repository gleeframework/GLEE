Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```

}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to try to get a better deal.
