"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I think this is a fair split, and I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for my part in this negotiation 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $6000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4800.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I was hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.
