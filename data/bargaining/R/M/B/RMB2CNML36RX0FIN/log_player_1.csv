Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about it.

I'll reject the offer for now. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent chunk of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, I really want to get something out of this, but I'm willing to give you a tiny share 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm running out of time and options.

I'll accept the offer, hoping that Bob will be generous in the future rounds.
