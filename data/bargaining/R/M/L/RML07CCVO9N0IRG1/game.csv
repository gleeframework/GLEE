6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable split. I believe this offer is fair to both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we both have a chance to get a better deal in future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,"I understand your point, Bob, but that split isn't fair to me. Let's try to find a more balanced agreement.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise. This offer is more in line with a 50/50 split considering the inflation working against you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I'm willing to give you a little more to avoid further inflation, but I still need a larger share to compensate for the losses.",Bob,4,
,,"This offer is still not acceptable, Bob. The inflation is affecting us both, and your proposed share is disproportionately high. I'm open to a compromise, but it needs to be fairer.",Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we need to find a solution soon.  I'm offering a slight majority, recognizing the inflation difference, but this is a fair deal given the circumstances.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share. Let's split it 75/25 this time.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I understand the urgency, but this is getting ridiculous. A 75/25 split is completely unfair, even considering the inflation. I'm trying to be reasonable, but you need to be realistic too.",Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  We're both losing money with every passing round. I propose a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option and the only way to ensure we both walk away with something.",Alice,7,
