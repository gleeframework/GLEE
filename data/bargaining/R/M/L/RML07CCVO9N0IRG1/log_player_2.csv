Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  We're both losing money with every passing round. I propose a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option and the only way to ensure we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt now.  While I'd prefer a larger share, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. A 50/50 split is the safest option at this point."
