"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100, and we can both walk away with $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm hoping to get a better deal next time! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still have the same amount to work with, but for Bob, the money is worth 20% less.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $30, considering that the money is worth 20% less for Bob. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but the money is worth 40% less for Bob (20% less than the previous round), I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting less and less, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share!""
}
```

This way, I'm keeping a larger share for myself, but still giving Bob a significant amount, considering the decreasing value of the money for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. You're not getting away with everything! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on Bob's offer now!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money for Bob, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it.

Since I still have the same amount to work with, I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's getting increasingly difficult for Bob to make a better offer, and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round."
