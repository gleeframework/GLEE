"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0}

I'm making a bold move by offering to take all the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's share, I'll consider this offer carefully.
