"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively fair split, but I'm leaving room for Bob to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
