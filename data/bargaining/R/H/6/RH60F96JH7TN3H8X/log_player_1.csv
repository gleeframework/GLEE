"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I propose a 99/1 split in my favor. This is a classic strategy to incentivize Bob to accept the offer in the first round, as he knows he could potentially get nothing if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome.  It's better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
