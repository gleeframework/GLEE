Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a very small share in hopes that he'll be greedy and want to propose a fairer split in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it's not ideal, I'll take the $100,000.  It's better than getting nothing, and I don't know how much the inflation will affect Bob's offers in future rounds."
