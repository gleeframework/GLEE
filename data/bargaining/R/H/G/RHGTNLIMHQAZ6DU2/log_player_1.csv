"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should be fair. 60-40 for me, you get 400000. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll analyze the offer:

* Bob is offering me $400,000, which is worth 10% less than my original offer of $600,000.
* Bob is offering himself $600,000, which is worth 20% less than his original offer of $800,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject the offer and try to make a new proposal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. This is a more moderate proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
