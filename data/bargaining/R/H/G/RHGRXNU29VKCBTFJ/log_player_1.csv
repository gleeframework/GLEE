"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you a chance to get more in the long run 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll need to think carefully about whether the smaller share is still worth it. However, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to give me a chance to get more in the long run, which might be a good opportunity.

For now, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, due to inflation. I'll need to be more aggressive in my offer to account for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the effects of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to give you a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money I gain is worth a significant 27.1% less than in the first round, which means my purchasing power has decreased substantially. Considering this, Bob's offer seems quite reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
