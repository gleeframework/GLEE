"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the first to make an offer and I want to secure a good chunk of the money. I believe this is a fair offer, as Bob is getting a significant amount as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, especially with the inflation affecting my potential future earnings."
