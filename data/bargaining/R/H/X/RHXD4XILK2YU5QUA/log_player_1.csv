"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point and Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  Accept and we both walk away with a good chunk of money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amount I would gain in the second round is 560,000$ (700,000 * 0.8).

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain 500,000$, which is more than what I would get in the second round. However, I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, and I don't want to commit to a split that might not be optimal.

I'll reject the offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the second round, the actual amount I would gain in the third round is 448,000$ (560,000 * 0.8).

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. This is a slight improvement from my initial offer, but I'm still trying to maximize my gain."
