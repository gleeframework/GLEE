"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try and get a large portion of the money in the first round, since the inflation will hurt Bob more than me. I'm offering him 10% of the money, hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm losing out on a lot of money, I believe I can do better by making a counter-offer in the next round. Since inflation hurts Bob more, he's likely to be more open to a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is still a significant amount for him, especially considering the inflation. Since he's losing more value with each round, I believe this is a fair offer that he'll be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's less than I hoped for, the inflation is really hurting Bob and I'm likely to get a worse deal if we continue. It's better to take what I can get now."
