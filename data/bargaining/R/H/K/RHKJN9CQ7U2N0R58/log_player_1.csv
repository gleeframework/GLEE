"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a significant share of the money, but also leaves some for Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I accept this offer. While it's significantly less than my initial proposal, the inflation would make the next round even worse for me. It's better to secure at least half of the remaining value than risk getting nothing."
