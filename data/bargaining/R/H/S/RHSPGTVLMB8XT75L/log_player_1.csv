"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which I believe is a reasonable and generous offer considering the decreasing value of money for him in subsequent rounds. I am hoping he will accept this proposal and we can conclude the game in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, he will be more motivated to settle for a lower amount as the game progresses. I am hoping to take advantage of this and get a larger share of the money in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's end this, the money is losing value for you""}\n\nIn this round, I am offering Bob 30% of the total amount. Since the money is worth 20% less for him in each subsequent round, I believe he will be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risking an even lower amount in the next round. I am trying to take advantage of the pressure the inflation is putting on Bob to settle for a lower amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's better than what you offered in round 1, and the clock is ticking for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI am accepting Bob's offer in this round. Although I was hoping to get an even better deal, Bob's offer is indeed better than my initial offer in round 1. Considering that the money is worth the same for me in every round, I don't have any incentive to continue the game and risk Bob making a worse offer in the next round. Additionally, Bob's message suggests that this is his final offer, so I don't think I can negotiate a better deal. It's time to conclude the game and take the 550,000 dollars."
