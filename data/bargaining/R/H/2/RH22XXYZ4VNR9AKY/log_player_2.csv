Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand wanting a more even split, but I think 60/40 is a fairer compromise considering the inflation. This gives us both a decent share. Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
