"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects our positions in the game. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer. I think I can get a better deal if I wait. Besides, the money is worth more now than it will be later due to inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Alice says in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more in my favor. Since the money is worth more now, I'll try to get a bit more than half. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, Alice. This split is a bit more even, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Alice thinks!"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, Bob, and the money is losing value. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the money is indeed losing value. However, I still believe I can get a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Since Alice said her previous offer was her final one, I'll try to meet her halfway while still getting a bit more for myself. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand the pressure of time and inflation, Alice. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's try this split.""}\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Alice thinks!"
