**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer makes more sense than continuing to play. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're already at Round 4 of 12, with the money losing value each round. The longer the game goes, the less we both get.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if we manage to secure a slightly better deal in later rounds, the inflation means the actual gain might not be significantly higher.  
* **Risk of Losing Everything:** If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. This offer guarantees a reasonable amount. 

It's better to take a decent deal now than risk everything for a potentially slightly better, but less certain, outcome later."
