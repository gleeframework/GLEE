Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very high split in my favor. While inflation is a factor, I'm banking on Bob being more agreeable to getting something than nothing in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, the 400,000 is a significant amount, and there's no guarantee I'll get anything better in the next round. The inflation risk is too high, and it's better to secure this amount."
