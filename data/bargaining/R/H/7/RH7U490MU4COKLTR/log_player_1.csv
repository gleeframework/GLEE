"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. What do you think?""
}
```

This offer is a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fair split, but I think I deserve a slight edge. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $5,400, and Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth $4,500.

Bob's new offer is a 50/50 split, which is a significant concession from his previous offer. I'll consider it, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the slight edge I had.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to round 2. My gain of $5,400 in round 2 is now worth $4,860, and Bob's gain of $4,500 is now worth $4,275.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, Bob. I'll take $5,500 and you can have $4,500. It's still a fair split, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a fair one, in the hopes that he'll accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this. I'll take 60% and leave you with 40%. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

In round 4, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $2,760, and Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth $3,426.

Bob's new offer is a 60/40 split, which is a significant concession from his previous offer. However, I'm not sure if I want to give him such a large share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. I'm trying to hold on to as much value as possible, given the increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob compared to round 4. My gain of $2,760 in round 4 is now worth $2,000, and Bob's gain of $3,426 is now worth $2,933.

Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, Bob. I'll take $3,000 and you can have $7,000. It's a 30/70 split, but I'm trying to be generous.""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a larger share, but still keep a significant portion for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game."
