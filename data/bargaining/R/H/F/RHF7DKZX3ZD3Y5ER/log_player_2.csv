"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's always worth exploring if I can get a better deal, especially since the money is losing value each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is fair considering we both stand to lose money with each passing round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less now, this is still a decent gain and I don't want to risk further inflation and potentially getting a worse offer."
