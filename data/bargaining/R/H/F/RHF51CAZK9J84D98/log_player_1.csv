"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share to start, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something.  It's a high risk, but I'm hoping he'll see the value of getting anything at all!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  Waiting another round risks getting nothing at all."
