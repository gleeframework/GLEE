Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a better deal than the last round. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly trying to chip away at my potential gains while keeping his own high. While the effects of inflation are starting to hurt, I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would mean losing a significant portion of the potential money due to the accumulating inflation."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient. This is my final offer. If you don't accept, we're both going to lose more money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming too severe. While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds as the money will be worth even less."
