Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still not good enough, try again 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, I need to hold out for a better deal.  Alice's offer is getting closer to even, but time is working more in my favor than hers.  She loses value faster each round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm shifting my strategy. Alice is clearly aiming for a near-even split, even with the inflation working against her.  Offering a 50/50 split might seem risky, but:

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the pressure is on both of us.
* **Psychology:** An even split might be more appealing to Alice now, as it seems ""fair"" and avoids a potentially worse outcome if she continues to reject.
* **Future Leverage:** If she rejects this offer, it shows she's willing to risk getting nothing at all for a tiny gain. This gives me more leverage in later rounds."
