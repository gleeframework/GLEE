"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! You'll get less in the next round.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, which is a good starting point, and gives Bob a relatively small amount to make him consider accepting. The message is a bit of a warning that he might get an even worse deal in the next round if he declines."
