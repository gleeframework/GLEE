Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair Alice, but consider the inflation.  This offer gives me a little extra to compensate. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5125,
""bob_gain"": 4875,
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is working against you, not me. I'm willing to be slightly more generous this time, but this is my final offer.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hurting me, but holding out any longer will hurt us both. Let's take the fair deal and end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right that holding out hurts us both due to inflation, he's clearly feeling the pressure more. He's now come back down to an even 50/50 split after rejecting that same offer in the first round.  There's no guarantee he'll offer me more in a future round, and the longer this goes on, the less his offers will be worth to him (meaning he might be more likely to accept a less favorable deal for himself)."
