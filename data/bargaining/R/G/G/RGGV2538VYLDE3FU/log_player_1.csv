"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to avoid further erosion of my gains. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
