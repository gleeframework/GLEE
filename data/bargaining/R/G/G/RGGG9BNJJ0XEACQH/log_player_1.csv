"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my $450,000 is now worth less than it was in the first round. However, I still have to consider the fact that Bob is offering me a larger share than before.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
