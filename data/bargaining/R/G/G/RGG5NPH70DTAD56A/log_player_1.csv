"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll be willing to accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a moderate difference, but I'm open to negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll have to adjust my calculation considering the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in Round 1, my gain of $80 is actually worth 95% of the original value, which is $76.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in Round 2, which means it's worth 95% of the value of $76, so it's $72.2.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a balance, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair share! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money in Round 4.

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in Round 1, my gain of $60 is actually worth 85.74% of the original value, which is $51.44.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm trying to hold out for a better deal, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in Round 4, which means it's worth 95% of the value of $51.44, so it's $48.83.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle, no more games!""
}
```"
