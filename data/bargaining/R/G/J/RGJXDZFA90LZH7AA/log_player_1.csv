"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'm not as keen on this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with an even more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share of the money, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With his gain being worth 48.8% less than the first round, it's a pretty meager amount now.

Considering my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll take this offer. It's a pretty good deal for me, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with even more severe inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
