Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are really hurting Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob receives something rather than risking a worse offer (or even nothing) in future rounds. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Each round sees a significant drop in the real value of Bob's potential winnings. 
* **Alice Holds Strong:**  Alice is consistently aiming for a larger share and hasn't shown a willingness to budge significantly.
* **Uncertainty Ahead:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds.  

It's a tough choice, but in the face of inflation and a tough negotiating partner, accepting is the most logical decision to salvage some value."
