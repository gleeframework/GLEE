"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer, aiming for a quick resolution. I'll take 99.9% of the money, hoping Bob accepts it to avoid risking further rounds and possible inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to continue pushing for a larger share, the risk of inflation is too high. Bob's offer guarantees me half the money, which is significantly better than risking the next 10 rounds and potentially losing everything."
