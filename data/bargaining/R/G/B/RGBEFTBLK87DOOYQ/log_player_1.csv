"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. My message to Bob is ""Let's be fair,"" indicating that I believe this division is reasonable and equitable. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. This considers the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject this offer. Since the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, but 20% less for Bob, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round. My rejection is strategic, aiming to capitalize on the effects of inflation on Bob's valuation of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $65 and Bob receives $35. My message to Bob is ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair,"" highlighting that due to the 20% decrease in value for Bob, this adjusted split is reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  It's important we settle this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject this offer. Despite Bob's message framing this as a final offer and emphasizing the impact of inflation, the fact remains that the money's value hasn't changed for me but has significantly decreased for Bob. Given this, I believe I can push for a more favorable split, especially since Bob is now more incentivized to settle due to the increasing effects of inflation on his potential gain.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Last chance before it's too late for you""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $70 and Bob receives $30. My message to Bob is ""Last chance before it's too late for you,"" emphasizing the urgent need for Bob to accept due to the rapidly diminishing value of the money for him. Given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, I'm pushing for an even more favorable split, leveraging the time pressure and the disparate effects of inflation to my advantage. It's now Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed, risking further devaluation of his share."
