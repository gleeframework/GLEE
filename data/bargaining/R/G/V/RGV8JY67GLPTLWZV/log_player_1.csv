"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his offer is equivalent to a 48/60 split, which is a 4/5 ratio. I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Since Bob's offer was a 4/5 ratio, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Will you accept a 55/45 split?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, his offer is equivalent to a 19.2/70.8 split, which is a 0.27/1 ratio. I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 5. Since Bob's offer was a 19.2/70.8 split, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""Will you accept a 42/58 split?""
