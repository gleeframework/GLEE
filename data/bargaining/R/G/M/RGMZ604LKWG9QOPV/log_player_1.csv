"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 
I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, accepting this offer guarantees me half the money, and the risk of inflation is too high to gamble on a better offer."
