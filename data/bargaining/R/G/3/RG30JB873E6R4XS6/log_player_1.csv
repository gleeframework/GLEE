"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep nearly all the money, offering Bob just $1. Since the money loses value for me with each round, I want to maximize my gain in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it's frustrating to get so little, accepting is the best option.  If I reject, the money will be worth even less for me in the next round, and Bob is likely to offer me even less."
