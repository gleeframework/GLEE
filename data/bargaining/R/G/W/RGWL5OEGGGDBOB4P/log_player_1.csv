"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think it's only fair I get a bit more. This way, we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is hitting you hard. Let's be realistic. This is a better deal for you than it will be next round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is severely undervaluing the impact of inflation. While he's offering a ""compromise,"" it's still heavily skewed in his favor considering the money will be worth significantly less for him very soon.  I need to push for a better deal while he still has a sense of urgency."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering a compromise. This deal is fair considering how much value you lose each round. Don't let this opportunity slip away.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation now and the fact that we both face some level of inflation, I believe a perfectly fair split is the most reasonable way to conclude this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  The inflation has significantly eroded the value of Bob's potential gain. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's the most reasonable offer I'm likely to get at this point.  Accepting now avoids the risk of getting nothing if we continue to haggle and run out of rounds."
