Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively high offer for myself, aiming for a quick resolution. However, I'm aware of the inflation and will adjust my strategy if needed in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option given the inflation.  If I reject, I have to make an offer in the next round, and the money will be worth less for me.  Taking half is better than risking getting a worse deal."
