"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the values are:

* Alice gain: 550,000 x 0.95 = 522,500
* Bob gain: 450,000 x 0.95 = 427,500

I'll accept this offer.
