```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Even split is not enough, considering the inflation on your side 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is using the inflation against me, but I still have time. Accepting 40 dollars now is better than nothing, but I think I can get a better deal.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate, but not be walked all over."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Okay, I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but this needs to be reasonable.  This is my final offer.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'final offer' wasn't final enough, it seems 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly enjoying stringing this out, but I need to hold firm. Accepting 38 dollars now is getting quite bad, but I'm hoping that my ""final offer"" bluff will make her reconsider pushing me much further.  I need to hold my ground and signal that I am serious."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm serious, Alice. We're wasting time here.  Take this offer or let's walk away with nothing.""}
```"

# Alice's message: I'll take a bigger share, since you're not budging 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is getting dangerous. While I want to stick to my guns, the value is dropping rapidly. Accepting 35 dollars is much better than the risk of getting nothing if Alice continues to push her luck."
