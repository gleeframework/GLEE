"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, Bob. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more equitable split that considers the time value of money. This offer benefits us both.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better return on my investment. This offer still benefits you, but it gives me a more substantial share. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  Each round that passes significantly decreases the value of the money for both of us, but especially for Alice. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** By rejecting, I risk getting an even lower offer in the next round, which would further erode my potential gains due to inflation.
* **Fairness:** While I'd prefer a larger share, 600,000 is a significant amount and a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances.

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting a worse deal later.
