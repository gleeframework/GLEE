"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. I'm hoping he'll accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given that you got the better end of the deal last round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think a 55/45 split is fair, considering I got the better end of the deal last round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less due to inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is the same as his previous offer, but I'm hoping he'll meet me in the middle this time."
