"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have it all, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken its toll!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to consider the value of the amount I'll get in the next round. If I accept this offer, I'll get $30, which is worth $28.75 in the next round. If I reject this offer, I'll get to make the next proposal, but the money will be worth even less.

Considering the potential future value, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself!""
}
```

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! The money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means I'll get $20, but it's actually worth $17.16 in the next round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 20% of the original amount, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even lower value. I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
