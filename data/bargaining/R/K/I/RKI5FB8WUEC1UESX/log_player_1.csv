Let's see if Bob is happy with this deal!  I'm hoping to get the lion's share early on, before inflation starts to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer to have more, a 50/50 split is a decent outcome considering inflation. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next rounds, and it's better to secure something now than risk losing everything."
