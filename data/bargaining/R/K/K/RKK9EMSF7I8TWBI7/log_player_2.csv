**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the threat of inflation against me, but she's not offering a deal that makes up for my losses.  While the rounds are ticking down, I'm banking on her willingness to compromise rather than walk away with nothing.  I need to hold firm and aim for a better split in the next few rounds."
