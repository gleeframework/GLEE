Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the effective value of the money has decreased. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it...

I'll reject the offer since it's a 50-50 split, which doesn't take into account the inflation effect on my end. I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreased value.
