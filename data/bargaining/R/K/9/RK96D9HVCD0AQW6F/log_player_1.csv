"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the inflation will impact us both. Let's aim for a 60/40 split, giving you a bit more since you proposed first. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
