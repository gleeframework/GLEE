"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the new numbers, I'll have to be more careful. Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80%). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to make up for inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (64% of 80%). Bob's gain is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (77% of 94%).

I'll have to be careful, as the offers are getting closer, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. However, this offer is slightly better than the previous one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept this offer.
