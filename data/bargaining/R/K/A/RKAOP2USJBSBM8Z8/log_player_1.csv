"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering to split the money evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a good starting point, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

I'm not too thrilled about taking less, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
