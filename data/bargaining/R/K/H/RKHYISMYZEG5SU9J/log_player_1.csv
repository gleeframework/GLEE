"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a bit. Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the fact that Bob's offer was a bit skewed towards his favor.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I'm getting a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. Considering the inflation effect, I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less, I'll have to weigh the relative value of the offer. However, I notice that Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, which is what I initially proposed.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I'm getting a fair deal considering the inflation.
