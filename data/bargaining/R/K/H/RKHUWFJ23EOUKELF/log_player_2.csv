"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair!  50/50 split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince I'm Bob, I'll explain my reasoning. Although a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation that affects me but not Alice, accepting this offer now would mean I'm losing value in future rounds if we don't come to an agreement. Given that the money's value decreases by 20% for me with each round, I have an incentive to try and negotiate for a better split in the next round, hoping that Alice might offer more to avoid further rounds where the value could potentially decrease further for me. Thus, I reject the offer in hopes of a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering my loss due to inflation, let's adjust the split to 60/40. It's more fair this way.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the impact of inflation on you, but I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split.  Let's compromise at 55/45. It's a fairer balance considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, my potential gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. Considering this significant decrease in value, accepting a 45% share now might be more advantageous than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Alice's offer of a 55/45 split seems like a reasonable compromise under these circumstances, especially since she is not affected by the inflation. Proceeding to further rounds risks decreasing the value of my potential gain even more, so accepting this offer appears to be the most prudent decision at this point."
