"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 seems like the best way to go. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still keep the same amount I offered in the first round. However, I notice that Bob is now offering a 50/50 split, which is a better deal for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
