Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation that will impact us both. Let's agree on this and get the money divided before it loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
