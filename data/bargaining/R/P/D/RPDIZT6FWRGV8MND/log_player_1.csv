"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by being a little greedy. I'm offering Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll want to negotiate in the next round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and I'd rather get $50 than risk getting nothing in the next round.  Let's call it a day!"
