"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob 40% of the total amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than the initial offer. However, Bob's offer is now a 50/50 split, which is quite aggressive.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new offer that's slightly more aggressive. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger hit, my potential gain is now worth significantly less than the initial offer. Bob's offer is now even more aggressive, with him taking the larger share.

I'll reject this offer as well.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Considering the significant inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a huge hit, my potential gain is now worth a tiny fraction of the initial amount. Bob's offer is still aggressive, but I think it's getting to the point where I should consider accepting to avoid getting even less.

I'll accept this offer.
