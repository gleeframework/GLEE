"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Fair and reasonable split, let's end the game""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I take 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob takes 20%. I think this is a fair and reasonable split, considering we're starting with a large amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's end the game 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Bob's offer is a 7:3 split, which is closer to my initial proposal than I expected.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not ready to accept a 7:3 split just yet. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Compromise is key, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing a 6:4 split, which is a bit more aggressive than Bob's previous offer, but still a compromise. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle and end the game."
