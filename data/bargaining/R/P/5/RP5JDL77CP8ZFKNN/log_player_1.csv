"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. Let's end the game here.""
}
```

This way, I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This is a more equitable split, and I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 450000 * 0.9 = 405000
Bob gain: 550000 * 0.95 = 522500

I'm not sure I like the terms of Bob's offer. I'd rather try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain, the remaining amount is worth 90% of the previous round's value, and Bob's gain is worth 95% of the previous round's value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and take a smaller share. This is a fair split, and I think we can end the game here.""
