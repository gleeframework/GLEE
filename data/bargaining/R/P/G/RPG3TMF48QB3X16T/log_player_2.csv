"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I think this is a fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is a large sum of money, it's worth considering that in the next round, Bob will get to make the offer, and the money will be worth less for Alice. It's worth taking the risk and seeing what Alice will offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
