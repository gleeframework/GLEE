Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting worse with inflation.  Let's be sensible and split this reasonably while it's still worthwhile for both of us.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is eating away at my share, and I'm being more than fair. Take this offer, or I'm walking away with nothing! 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting down to the wire. While I'd prefer a better split, Alice is clearly getting desperate and the value of her share is diminishing rapidly. If I push further, she might walk and we'll both get nothing. It's better to secure a win now, even if it's not the ideal amount."
