Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is running out. We're past the halfway point, and the money is losing value quickly. Holding out for a slightly better offer in the next round or two is worth the risk, as the devaluation will soon make even a 50/50 split significantly less appealing."
