I'm going for a large share, as the inflation will hurt me more in the future. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy!  I'll reject this offer.  Inflation will make the money worth less to me in the next round, but I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to make the offer more appealing, but still leaving myself with a significant chunk of the money. Inflation is a major factor, and I need to get a decent deal before it eats away at my gains even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting even more ridiculous!  I'm still in a better position to wait, as inflation will hurt me less than a 50/50 split.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get a reasonable deal. This time, I'm lowering my share to 900,000, which still leaves me with a sizable portion of the money. This is a significant concession, and I hope Bob recognizes the benefit of taking this deal before the inflation eats away at the value even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even more unreasonable than the last! While it's tempting to take something, the inflation rate is making the value of the offer rapidly decrease.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  Maybe Bob will finally realize that we're both going to lose money if we don't come to an agreement soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

This offer reflects the ever-increasing impact of inflation.  I'm further lowering my share, but this is still a substantial gain, considering the rapidly declining value of money for me. Bob needs to realize that we are both losing money with each passing round, and a fair deal is in both our best interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy!  While 150,000 is a significant sum of money, the inflation rate is continuing to devalue my share. I'll reject this offer, but I am starting to feel the pressure. I need to get a deal before inflation eats away at my share any further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

This is getting dicey. I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still trying to secure a reasonable amount. Inflation is steadily eroding the value of my potential gains. I'm hoping Bob will finally see the logic in accepting this offer.  It's in both of our best interests to reach a deal before we both end up with nothing."
