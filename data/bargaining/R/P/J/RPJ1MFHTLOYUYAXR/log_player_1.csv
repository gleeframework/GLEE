"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to be more careful. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll consider the actual values as follows:

My gain: 200000 / 0.8 = 250000 (in terms of purchasing power)
Bob's gain: 800000 / 0.9 = 888888.89 (in terms of purchasing power)

Considering the reduced purchasing power, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more balanced split, but still keeping a larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain: 300000 / 0.5168 (1 - 0.4832) = 580.392 (in terms of purchasing power from the first round)
Bob's gain: 700000 / 0.7269 (1 - 0.2731) = 962.444 (in terms of purchasing power from the first round)

However, since we're considering the value from the perspective of the current round, we should compare the values directly:

My gain: 300000
Bob's gain: 700000

Considering the reduced purchasing power, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm now offering a 50-50 split, hoping to end the game quickly."
