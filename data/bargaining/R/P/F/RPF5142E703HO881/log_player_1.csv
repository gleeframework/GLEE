This is a tough one! While not ideal, accepting is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  My potential gains are decreasing significantly with each round due to the inflation. Accepting $4,000 now is better than risking even less in future rounds.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems content to wait me out, knowing the longer the game goes on, the more he benefits.  
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I can get Bob to agree to a better deal in subsequent rounds. He might propose even less favorable terms. 

While I could hold out hope for a better offer, the odds are against me. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now minimizes potential losses."
