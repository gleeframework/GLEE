Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant inflation penalty you're facing, I believe a 60/40 split is now more than fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""While not ideal, I recognize the time pressure and accept your offer.""
}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is identical to the one Alice initially proposed, the impact of inflation has significantly eroded Alice's potential gains. Accepting 4000 USD at this point is better than risking a worse offer in later rounds and potentially receiving nothing at all."
