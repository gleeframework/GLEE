Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise a bit more, but I'm still not willing to split it evenly 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making small concessions, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation. I need to signal I'm serious about a more equitable split, or Alice will coast to a win with these minimal compromises."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it - I'm done negotiating.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the inflation is seriously cutting into my potential gains.  
* **Strong Signal:** A firm ""take it or leave it"" message with an even split shows I'm serious about not accepting anything unfair. This might be enough to get Alice to concede, fearing I won't budge further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice will reject this and I'll be forced to make less favorable offers later. However, the potential reward of securing an even split now outweighs the risk of further losses due to inflation."
