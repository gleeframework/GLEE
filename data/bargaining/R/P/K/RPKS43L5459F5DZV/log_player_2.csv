"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice rejected the 50-50 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Considering the 5% inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating into the value of the money, I need to be more cautious. Alice's offer is still a 48-52 split, but it's worth less than 50-50 due to the inflation. I'll accept this offer to get some money, rather than risking a worse deal in the next round.
