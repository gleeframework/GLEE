"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, what do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% decrease in value isn't too bad, and I think I can get more than 4000. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the 5% decrease in value for me and the 10% decrease for Alice. Meeting in the middle seems fair, and I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer. The message is a gentle nudge to remind her of the inflation factor. Fingers crossed!"
