Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 95/5 split.  While I understand your concerns about inflation, I believe this offers a fairer distribution, given the way it impacts us both. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
