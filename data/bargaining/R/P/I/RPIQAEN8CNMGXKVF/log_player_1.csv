Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about finding a fair split.  This offer reflects the time pressure and the diminishing value. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the negotiation goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for Alice due to the 10% inflation per round. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting Bob's offer in hopes of a slightly better deal in Round 5 is incredibly risky. The potential gain is minimal compared to the potential loss if Bob proposes an even worse deal, or if an agreement can't be reached before the money's value diminishes significantly. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently moved towards a more even split, indicating a willingness to negotiate. Accepting this offer might be the best outcome achievable. 
 
It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a much lower amount later."
