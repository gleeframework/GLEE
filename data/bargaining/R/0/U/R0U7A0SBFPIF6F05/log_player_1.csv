{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 90/10. This is a fair deal, considering the inflation penalty you'll have to deal with in the future rounds. Let's be reasonable and end the game now.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite lopsided. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
