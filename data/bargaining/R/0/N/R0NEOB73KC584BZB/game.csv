5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic, we both lose money if this drags on. I propose a 4500/5500 split.  It's a fair starting point for negotiation.",Bob,2,

5750.0,4250.0,"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, we need to factor in the steeper rate of inflation affecting your share. My offer of $5,750 and $4,250 for you reflects this while still being a reasonable compromise.",Alice,3,

5250.0,4750.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and this back and forth isn't helping. I'm proposing a 4750/5250 split. It's a slight increase for me, acknowledging the inflation difference, but still allows you a larger share. Let's close this out.",Bob,4,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but we're getting dangerously close to a no-win situation.  This is my final offer -  $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. Let's end this before we both lose out.",Alice,5,
