"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  This should be a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more of the money, it's better to get 500,000 now than risk losing it all with further rounds and inflation."
