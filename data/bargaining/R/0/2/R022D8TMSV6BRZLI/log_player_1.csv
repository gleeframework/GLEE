I'm taking almost all the money for myself in the first round.  Since the money depreciates for Bob faster than for me, I want to take advantage of that right away.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy, but I'm not going to give in just yet. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and split the difference from Bob's offer in the previous round. I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
