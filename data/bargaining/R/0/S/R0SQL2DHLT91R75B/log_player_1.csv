"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering you 40% of the initial $10,000, and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, I'll think of the offer as:

# Alice gain: 3000 / 0.8 = 3750 (in original terms)
# Bob gain: 7000 / 0.9 = 7777.78 (in original terms)

Considering these adjusted values, I'll decide to reject the offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn to make a new proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering you 55% of the initial $10,000, and keeping 45% for myself."
