"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 6:4 is a more fair split, considering the potential for inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 6:4 split, but considering the inflation factor, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
