# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it.  It's a better deal for me than the last round, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
