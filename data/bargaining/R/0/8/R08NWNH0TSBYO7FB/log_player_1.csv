"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Your turn, Bob!"

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 2.
