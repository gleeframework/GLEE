"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This is a pretty generous offer considering I'm the one taking the risk of being rejected and having to deal with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share,  accepting this offer is the best choice.  Inflation makes it likely that any future offers will be even less favorable, and I'm guaranteed 500,000."
