"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a straightforward offer. I'll take the whole $100, but I'll let you have a chance to propose something better in the next round.""
}
```

This offer is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a starting point and make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the loss of value in each round, I propose we split the $100 such that you receive $52.37, which maintains its full value, while I receive $47.63. 
# Alice gain: 52.37 
# Bob gain: 47.63 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the proposal, I'd like to accept Bob's offer. The split seems reasonable, and I'm glad he's taking into account the effects of inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
