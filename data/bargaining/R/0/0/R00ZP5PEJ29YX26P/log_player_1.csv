I'm going for a large share, hoping Bob will accept knowing that he gets something.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 272728 
# Bob gain: 727272 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a lot less than I was hoping for, it's better than nothing.  Inflation is a factor, and I'd rather have a smaller share now than risk getting nothing in future rounds."
