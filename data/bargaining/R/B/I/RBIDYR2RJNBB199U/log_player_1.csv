"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my share of 400,000 is now worth 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000. Not bad, but I was hoping to get more. However, Bob's share of 600,000 is still worth 600,000, which is a lot more than I'd like to give up.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the previous offer from Bob, I'll try to be more aggressive this time. Since the money is worth 10% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share now to compensate for the future losses.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share! With the 27.1% decrease, my share of 450,000 is now worth 450,000 * 0.727 = 327,150. Still, it's a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

I'll accept this offer.
