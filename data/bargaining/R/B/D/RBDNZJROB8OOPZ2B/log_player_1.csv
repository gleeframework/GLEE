I'm offering you $9000 and Bob $1000. It's a good deal for me, but I'm willing to share some of the wealth. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a fair deal. With the inflation, I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the next rounds."
