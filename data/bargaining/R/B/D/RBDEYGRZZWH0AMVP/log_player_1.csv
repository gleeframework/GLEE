"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the value of the money Bob gains. Since it's worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to think carefully.

I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share! Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the value of the money Bob gains. With it being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll need to consider the long-term implications.

I'll accept the offer.
