"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still get $500,000, but for Bob, it's worth 10% less, so he'll get $450,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
