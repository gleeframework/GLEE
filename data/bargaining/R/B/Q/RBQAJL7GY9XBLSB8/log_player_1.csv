"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair and reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob's offer is slightly better than the initial 0/100 split, I'll accept this offer for now.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
