Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation rate.  Let's try this to see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is much worse for me than the first round. I need to push for a better deal.
