"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and taking the remaining $900,000. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to meet in the middle.

I'll analyze the offer:

* If I accept, I'll get $500,000, which is worth the same as in the first round.
* Bob will get $500,000, but it's worth 20% less than in the first round.

Considering the inflation effect, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
