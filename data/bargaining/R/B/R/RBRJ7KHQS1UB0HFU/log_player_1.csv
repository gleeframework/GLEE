"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. This way, we both get a decent share and the game can end quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a better deal for himself.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather not give him the full 600,000$. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60-40 in your favor is fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a different split.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending a message to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a fairer split. Let's finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. This way, I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable."
