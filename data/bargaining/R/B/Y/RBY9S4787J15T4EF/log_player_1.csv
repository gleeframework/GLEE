"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, especially with the reduced value of money. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the previous rejection, I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob offered 60% in the last round, I'll try to counter with a slightly lower offer for him, while keeping a higher share for myself.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
