"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent chunk of the money while ensuring I get the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's true that the money is worth less with each passing round, Bob's offer is far too unfair.  I would be getting only 200,000, a significant decrease from the 900,000 I initially offered.  I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split, giving myself $600,000 and Bob $400,000.  This is a more balanced offer than the previous round, taking into account the inflation.  I believe it's a fair proposal that gives us both a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While the money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, I'm still unwilling to accept a 40/60 split.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. Given the significant inflation and the fact that we're halfway through the game, I believe this is the most equitable and practical solution. It gives us both an equal share of the remaining value, and avoids the risk of further losses due to inflation."
