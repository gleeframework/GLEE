{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more equitable this time.  I'm willing to give you a good share, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 45-55 split. I was hoping for a more equal split, especially since the money is decreasing in value due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
