Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a slight advantage, but I'm sure we can agree to a fair split. Let's reverse our positions from the last round and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I would have preferred my initial offer, accepting Bob's proposal in round 2 is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Avoiding Further Losses:**  Delaying further means the $10,000 pot shrinks, hurting both of us.
* **Fair Outcome:** Bob's offer is a simple reversal of my initial proposal. It's a fair compromise. 
* **Uncertain Future:** There's no guarantee I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. Bob might become more demanding, and the inflation will continue to erode the value."
