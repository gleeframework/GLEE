"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but Bob's offer is still quite generous. I'm not sure if I should take it. However, I think I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to get a better share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
