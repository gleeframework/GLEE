"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob has turned the tables on me! 

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm trying to get a slightly better share for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
