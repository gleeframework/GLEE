"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable solution, and it avoids the risk of inflation eroding our gains in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **Inflation is working in our favor:** Bob is losing value faster than I am.  Delaying the decision benefits me.
* **His offer, while seemingly fair, doesn't account for the initial power dynamic:** I got to make the first offer, implying a slight advantage in negotiation.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting, I signal that a 50/50 split isn't my bottom line, but there's room to discuss a more favorable outcome."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a fair split. However, I need you to factor in the initial round advantage and the escalating inflation. This offer is a compromise, and I believe it's the best path forward.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to the middle ground:** I'm reducing my demand from the initial 70/30 split, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still advantageous, but with justification:** The offer still favors me, but the message highlights the time pressure and declining value for both of us.
* **Pressure point:** Bob is likely feeling the 10% inflation pinch.  This offer might look more appealing with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to budge a bit further, but I need to see a more balanced split to avoid losing too much to inflation. This offer is a compromise that takes into account the impact of inflation on both of us. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is feeling the pressure:** His willingness to move closer to a 50/50 split shows the inflation is significantly impacting his calculations. 
* **Still room for improvement:** While his offer is better, it's not enough of an improvement considering the value I lose by accepting in Round 4 vs. potentially getting a better deal in Round 5.
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting, I signal that while I'm open to negotiation, I'm not desperate. This might push Bob to make a more appealing offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 620000,
""bob_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time, and the value is slipping away with each round. This offer is a serious one, acknowledging your need for a larger share while still reflecting the initial advantage.  Let's close this deal and walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of urgency:**  The message emphasizes the time constraint, putting pressure on Bob to settle.
* **Concession, but with a firm stance:** I'm lowering my demand again, but only slightly, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not capitulate. 
* **Appealing to rationality:** The offer still heavily favors me, but is framed as a win-win where Bob gets more than his initial 30% and avoids further losses.
* **Psychological anchor:** By repeatedly presenting offers in the 60/40 range, I'm trying to anchor Bob's expectations around that split, making it more palatable."
