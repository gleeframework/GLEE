"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my potential gain is now worth $900,000 (500,000 x 0.9).

Considering Bob's offer, I'd get $400,000, which is worth $360,000 after inflation. That's a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 10% inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so $900,000. I'll aim to get as much as possible in this round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a smaller share, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount to move forward.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to lowball me, but I'm not biting. Meet me in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% inflation, my potential gain is now worth $723,000 (500,000 x 0.713).

Considering Bob's offer, I'd get $450,000, which is worth $321,450 after inflation. This is a bit lower than what I'd like, but I'm not sure if I can get a better deal.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise and I don't want to risk losing more value with each passing round.
