"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as needed""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I'm starting with a relatively fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, as I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split in Bob's favor, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since Bob is taking the risk of rejecting my offer, I'll consider his proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the initial offer was 60-40 in your favor""}

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
