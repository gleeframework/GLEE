"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 70-30 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to have a significant portion while accounting for the decreasing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 65-35 split, aiming for a fair division considering the diminishing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
