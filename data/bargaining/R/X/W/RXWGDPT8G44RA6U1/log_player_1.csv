I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a larger share. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively unequal split in the first round. Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and a significant improvement over the first round. While I'm still losing out on some potential gains due to inflation, I'm better off accepting this offer than risking further rounds and potentially getting nothing."
