Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the future rounds, but I want to establish a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I believe that accepting this offer is the best course of action.  The inflation is starting to take effect and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
