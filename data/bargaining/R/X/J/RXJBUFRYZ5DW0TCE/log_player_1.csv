"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this time, but I'm still willing to be generous! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too skewed towards you, Bob! I'm not ready to accept yet.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a new proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less from the first round and another 10% less from the second round), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

This offer reflects the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm trying to negotiate a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being a bit more generous, I'll take a slightly smaller share this time! 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I think we've found a sweet spot! I'll accept this offer.""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a fair compromise considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
