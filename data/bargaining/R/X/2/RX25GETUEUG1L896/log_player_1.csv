"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my share of $300,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $240,000.

I'm not thrilled about the reduced share, but I'm willing to compromise. I accept Bob's offer.
