"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split the money 60-40 in my favor, as it's my turn to propose. This seems fair given the stakes of the game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the offer in terms of the amount I'll receive.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better split to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a slight improvement from the previous round."
