"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given that I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice. Let's try a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm being too greedy, huh?

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too skewed in your favor, Bob. I want a more equal split.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less for me now, so I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. How about a 42-58 split?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this more balanced offer!"
