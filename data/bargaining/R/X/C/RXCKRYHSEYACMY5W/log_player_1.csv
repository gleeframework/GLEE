"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more even split. We have to work together to make sure we both get something in the end, and this inflation is no joke! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
