"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2000 is worth 95% of its original value, so it's actually $1900 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, as I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.
