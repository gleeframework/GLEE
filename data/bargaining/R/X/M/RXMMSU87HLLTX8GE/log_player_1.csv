"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000. This seems like a fair and reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time.  Let's see if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the inflation.

I'll make a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?""}

I'm hoping Bob will consider my counteroffer and be willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'm going to try to push for a slightly more even split. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think 52/48 is a fairer split. Let's see if you're willing to meet me halfway.""}

I'm hoping Bob will consider my proposal and be willing to compromise again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a little, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the continued slide towards a larger share for Bob, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the inflation.

I'll make a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 55.56/44.44 split. How about we try 51.5/48.5? I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a more reasonable compromise.""}

{""alice_gain"": 4900, ""bob_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 49/51 is a fairer split. Let's see if you're willing to meet me at the 50/50 mark.""}
