Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."

Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less, I'll have to be more aggressive to get a better deal. I reject Bob's offer.
