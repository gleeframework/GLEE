"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.  It's a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even with the inflation, I'm still getting a significantly lower amount than my initial proposal.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split this time, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000.  This takes into account the inflation, but I'm still willing to compromise to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  Even with the significant inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.  Bob's offer is still too low compared to my initial proposal and the potential value of the money in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000.  I'm still taking into account the inflation, but I believe this is a fair compromise considering the potential for further inflation in the future rounds.  I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'm receiving significantly less than I initially hoped for, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money.  It's better to accept this offer and get something rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
