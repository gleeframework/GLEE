"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This way, I get the majority of the money, and Bob still gets a substantial amount.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While he is offering me $450,000, this is significantly less than the $900,000 I was aiming for in the first round. Even considering inflation, this offer is not fair to me. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but I still believe it is a fair deal considering the inflation we're experiencing.  I hope Bob will see reason and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While Bob is offering me $350,000, this is significantly less than the $600,000 I was aiming for in the previous round.  This offer is not even close to a fair deal.  Even after considering inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  With inflation continuing to affect both of us, a fair and equal division seems like the best option for both of us.  I hope Bob is willing to accept this reasonable offer."
