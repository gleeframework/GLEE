I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob will accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than nothing, it's still a massive loss for me. I'm going to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm willing to give Bob a bit more this time, but I still need to secure a decent share. Inflation is a factor, but I believe I can still get a fair deal."
