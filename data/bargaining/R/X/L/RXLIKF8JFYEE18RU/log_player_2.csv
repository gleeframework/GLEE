"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a proposal for round 2. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Alice's offer. Since I'm getting less money than I would have in the first round, I'll have to be cautious. However, 450,000 is still a decent amount, and it's a significant portion of the remaining money. I'll accept this offer.
