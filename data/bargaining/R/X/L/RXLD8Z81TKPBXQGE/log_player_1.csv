"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point given the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action. My share is significantly lower than the first round, and the inflation will only continue to shrink my gains.  A 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise to avoid risking even less in future rounds."
