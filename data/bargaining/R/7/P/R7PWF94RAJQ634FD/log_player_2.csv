"Round 1

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time, Alice. A fair deal is better than no deal at all.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking, and this is still the best deal for both of us. Think about it! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. I'm offering you a larger share than before. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you halfway. This is a compromise considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is positioning this as a compromise, it's important to remember that the value of her gain is significantly diminished by the inflation. My potential gains remain static.  I need to push for a larger share while it's still advantageous for Alice to accept *something* rather than risk getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you a deal you might not like, but one you should seriously consider. Every round makes walking away with nothing more likely. Don't let that happen.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning.  Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation and is making concessions.  By increasing my demand, I'm putting the pressure back on her to make a decision before her potential gains dwindle further.  There's a risk she'll reject this offer, but the potential reward of securing a larger share outweighs that risk at this stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair option left considering the time constraint. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally feeling the heat.  While a 65/35 split was ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical move.  

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point with only 5 rounds remaining.  The risk of walking away with nothing is significantly higher than accepting a slightly less favorable deal.
* **Alice's Desperation:**  Her offer and message clearly indicate a sense of urgency. She's realizing the impact of inflation and understands that her bargaining position weakens with each passing round. 

This is no longer about maximizing gains, but about securing a win before time runs out."
