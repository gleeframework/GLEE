Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a better deal than your previous offer.  Let's split it 60/40, which is still fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
