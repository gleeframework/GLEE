"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'm not as eager to settle for a smaller share. However, Bob's offer is fair and reasonable, considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer.
