"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. I'll give you a decent chunk of the money to keep you happy.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, Alice. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $500,000 is actually worth $400,000 (80% of $500,000).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
