Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try an even split this time. We both lose value each round, so a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take the even split and avoid further risk of losing more value."
