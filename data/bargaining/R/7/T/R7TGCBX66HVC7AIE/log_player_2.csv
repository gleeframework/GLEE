"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While she acknowledges the inflation, she's using it to justify a significantly larger share. I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such an unbalanced starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your starting offer was quite unbalanced. I'm proposing a more even split that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us, but recognizes that it hits you harder.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer is still not accounting for the rapid inflation I am experiencing.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is fixated on the inflation difference, but not moving nearly enough to justify the gap in our shares.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  The declining value makes each round increasingly risky."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is a serious offer, Alice. I'm acknowledging the inflation disparity by offering you a larger share than me, but it needs to be reasonable. The clock is ticking.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer that reflects the significant impact inflation is having on my share.  It's more than fair considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I need to accept. Alice is clearly entrenched, and while it's not ideal, accepting a 45/55 split is better than risking getting nothing at all as the rounds progress.  The rapid inflation against Alice's share works in my favor here, as her ""final offer"" is closer to my previous proposal."
