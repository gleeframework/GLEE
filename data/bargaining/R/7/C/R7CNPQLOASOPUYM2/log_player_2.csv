"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While it seems tempting to take $40 right now, I need to aim for a more equitable split.  The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation will hurt me.  I need to apply pressure quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more balanced deal. This offer is a good starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is still not generous enough. Accepting now would mean losing a significant portion of the potential gain. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Inflation is eating into our potential gains. Let's be reasonable and split this evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit, but I still deserve more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting dangerous.  Alice is barely budging, and the inflation is killing my potential gains. However, accepting anything less than a 50/50 split at this point would be a significant loss. I need to gamble that she'll be more agreeable soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This is a compromise - let's end this before inflation eats up even more of our potential winnings.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a tiny bit more, but that's my limit 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough pill to swallow, but I have to be realistic.  The inflation is crushing my potential gains with each passing round. If I reject this offer, there's a very real chance I'll end up with even less, or nothing at all, as we get closer to the deadline."
