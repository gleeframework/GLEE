Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and start with a 90/10 split. I figure Bob might be willing to accept something smaller than 50/50 in the first round, and I want to get as much as possible before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, I'm aware that my gains are worth less each round due to inflation.  Bob's offer is significantly better than what I'd be able to secure if I rejected and made a counter-offer. It's not ideal, but it's the most logical decision given the circumstances."
