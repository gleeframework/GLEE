"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than 45%. I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering we both want a good deal.""}\n\nI've made a counteroffer that gives me a bit more than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves her with a significant amount. Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take the offer. The inflation is eating into the value of the money, and I don't think I can get a better deal than this. Plus, Alice says it's her final offer, so I don't want to risk getting nothing.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
