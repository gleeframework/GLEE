"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since I'm the one making the offer, I'm aiming for a bit more, but I want to be fair enough that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still a decent split. Considering the inflation, I don't want to risk getting nothing in the next round."
