"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000, and I'll take $6000. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower share, but it's still a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it since it's not significantly different from the first offer, and I'd like to try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you $4500, and I'll take $5500. It's a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
