"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. This is a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I want to aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping for a good compromise!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still reasonable considering the inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I think we can meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, with the inflation, the money is worth much less, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to take it. Let's hope Bob is happy with the deal!"
