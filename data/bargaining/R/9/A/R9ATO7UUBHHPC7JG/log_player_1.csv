"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering to take $700,000 and leave $300,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping to start the negotiations on a positive note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less now. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not convinced that the offer is good enough, especially considering the slight decrease in the value of the money. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000 and leave $450,000 for Bob, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less now. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to meet me halfway, and I'd like to continue negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increased inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm offering to take $490,000 and leave $510,000 for Bob, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
