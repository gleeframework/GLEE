"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less generous offer, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer from Bob.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $40, while Bob gets $60. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""A bit more generous than Bob's offer, but still fair""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $45 and Bob gets $55. I'm trying to be a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, while still being mindful of the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
