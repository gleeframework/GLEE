"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair and reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering that I'm the one making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced split, but still a good deal for me 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the offer, as I was hoping for a better split. However, I'm willing to consider a more balanced split. Since Bob's offer is not significantly better than the previous one, I'll reject it and hope for a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm willing to give up some of my initial demand and meet Bob halfway, offering him a slightly larger share of the pie. I'm hoping this more conciliatory approach will lead to a more acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more to Alice, but I still want a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

After considering the offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise. Bob is still getting a slightly larger share, but I'm getting a decent amount as well. Given the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less than it was initially, I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
