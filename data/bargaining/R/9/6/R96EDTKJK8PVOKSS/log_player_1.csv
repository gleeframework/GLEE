I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he's willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is much less favorable than my initial proposal. I'll reject it and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm willing to lower my share, but not drastically. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to reach an agreement."
