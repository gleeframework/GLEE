"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to keep the game interesting.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to give Bob a decent amount to keep him engaged in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, especially since it's losing value for both of us with each round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to settle for 50/50, considering the value of the money is decreasing for me. Let's see what I can do in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the value of the money is decreasing faster for me. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think a more even split is still fair, given the inflation affecting both of us. Let's end this before the money becomes worthless! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me now. Bob's offer is tempting, but I still think I can do better. I'll try to squeeze out a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to settle for 45/55 just yet. I'll keep pushing for a better deal.""
}
```"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, so I'll aim for a better split. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you're willing to give me the edge I need.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, but I'm hoping Bob will still be willing to give me a bit more."
