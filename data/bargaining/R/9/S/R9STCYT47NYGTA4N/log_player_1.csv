I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a significant share, but still leaves Bob with something. This should encourage him to accept in the first round, avoiding any risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation is starting to bite. It's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting less in the future."
