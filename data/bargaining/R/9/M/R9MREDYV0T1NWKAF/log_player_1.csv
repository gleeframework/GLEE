"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject this offer, as I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split in favor of Bob. My goal is to get a fair share, and I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more this time, but still want to keep it relatively close. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take a slightly larger share, but still keeping it relatively balanced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go easy on you! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer, as I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split in favor of Bob. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Back to 50/50. I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal!""
}
```
