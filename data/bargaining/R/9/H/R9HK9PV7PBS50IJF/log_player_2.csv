"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob.  I get 65% and you get 35%.  This recognizes my slight advantage in the early rounds due to the inflation rate, but leaves us both with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next!  While this is a decent offer, I think I can do better with more rounds.  The inflation rate will hurt Alice more than me in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing your early advantage but also accounting for the inflation impact.  This should be a good deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm proposing 58% for me and 42% for you. It's a slight adjustment from my previous offer to account for the inflation, but still ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt. This offer secures me a decent amount, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we keep going."
