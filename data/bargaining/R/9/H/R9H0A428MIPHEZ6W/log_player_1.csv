"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a fair split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is 400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and Bob's gain is 600,000, which is 60% of the original amount. I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether I should accept this offer or wait for the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Trying to get closer to a fair split from my perspective. Let's see if you accept.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation! In this round, my gain is 450,000, which is 45% of the original amount, and Bob's gain is 550,000, which is 55% of the original amount. I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether I should accept this offer or wait for the next round.
