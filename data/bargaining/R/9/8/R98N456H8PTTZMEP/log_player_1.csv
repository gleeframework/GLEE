"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can adjust in the next rounds""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he'll accept a relatively fair split early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, as I am the one proposing this round. We can adjust further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that he's making the proposal this round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, it's not fair to me""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, we can both get 50/50""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the money. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
