Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll aim to get a bigger share this time. I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
