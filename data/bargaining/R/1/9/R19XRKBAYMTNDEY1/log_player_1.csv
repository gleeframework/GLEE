"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I think a 60/40 split is more balanced.  We can finish this quickly and both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to flip the script and make me accept a 60-40 split in his favor!

I'm not going to fall for it, though. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split. Let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this proposal and accept it."
