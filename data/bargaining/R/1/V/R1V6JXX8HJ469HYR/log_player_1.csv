"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 10% if you accept now""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly to avoid losing more value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but you'll have to wait a bit longer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or not. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'd need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even though it's a ""fair share"", I'm not sure what ""a bit longer"" means in terms of rounds, and I'm not confident that I'll get a better deal later on. I'd rather wait and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my potential earnings are now even lower. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a decent share, don't wait for a worse deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a slightly more generous share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer before it's too late!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take control, you'll get a small share, but it's getting late. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept it or not. Since the money is worth 48.8% less now, I'd need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even though it's a small share, I'm not convinced that it's the best I can get. I'm still holding out for a better deal, and I don't want to give up too much too soon. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 61.36% less than in the first round now, and I'm getting desperate!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Split it 50/50, no more games, let's end this""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, hoping that he'll accept it and we can finally end this game. I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation!"
