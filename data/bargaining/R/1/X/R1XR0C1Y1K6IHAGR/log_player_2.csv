I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I'm going to try to get a better deal. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher share, keeping in mind the inflation effects."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation will affect us both differently. Let's make this a quick deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is affecting us differently, I'll meet you in the middle, slightly in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  The inflation is starting to hit hard, and I'd rather secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing at all."
