"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'm keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'm going to try to take more this time 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a bigger share this time.

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think Bob is being too aggressive. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 28% of the remaining $100, which is $28. I'm keeping 72% for myself, which is $72."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you exactly in the middle this time, but I'm still not sure I'm getting the best deal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle this time.

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a 50/50 split, which seems fair considering the game has been going on for a few rounds. I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal if I reject and try to negotiate further, so I'll take this offer."
