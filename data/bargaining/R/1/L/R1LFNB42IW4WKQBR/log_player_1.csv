"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, and attach a message to persuade him to accept it. Since there's no inflation in the first round, the money is still worth its full value. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split.  It's important we reach an agreement soon, as the value decreases with each round. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less in this round, the actual value of my gain would be 5500 * 0.8 = 4400. Considering this, I think I can get a better deal in the next round, so I'll reject Bob's offer. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I've considered your previous offer and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. However, I still believe I deserve a bit more. Let's settle this before the value drops further!""}\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, I'll try to find a balance between getting a good deal and accounting for the decreasing value. I'll offer Bob 42% of the money, which is closer to his proposed 45%. Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The money is literally vanishing as we argue. My last offer is more than fair, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\nSince the money I gain is worth 48.8% less in this round, the actual value of my gain would be 5200 * 0.512 = 2662.4. At this point, I think it's better to accept Bob's offer rather than risking another round of inflation. I'll take the offer and end the game here."
