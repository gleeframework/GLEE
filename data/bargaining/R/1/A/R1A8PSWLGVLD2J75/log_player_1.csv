Bob's offer is the same as mine, just reversed, but his money is worth less! I'm not going to settle for anything less than what I offered him in the first round.  Let's see if I can get a better deal."

Bob is still offering a 20/80 split, but his money is worth significantly less now! I'm not going to give up this much ground, and I'm confident I can still get a better deal. Let's keep playing!"

Round 5

I'm going to continue to lower my desired share, but I'm still keeping a majority. I'll offer 70% for me and 30% for Bob. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him, especially with inflation eating away at his potential gains."

Bob's offer is still the same as mine, just reversed.  Even though his money is worth significantly less, I'm still going to hold out for a better deal. I'm confident I can still get a more favorable split before the time runs out."

I'm going to continue lowering my desired share, but I'm still aiming for a comfortable lead.  I'll offer 60% for me and 40% for Bob. With the inflation impacting his potential gains so heavily, I'm hopeful this will be a tempting offer."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though inflation is seriously hurting Bob's potential gains, I'm still going to reject this offer.  While it's close to the 50/50 split I was aiming for,  I'm confident I can still push for a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds.  We're both starting to feel the pressure of the time limit, so I might be able to squeeze out an extra $1,000 or so."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

We're running out of time, so I need to make a move that's closer to a 50/50 split. I'm offering 55% for me and 45% for Bob.  With inflation hitting him hard, this might be a good compromise.  We're both losing money with each round, so it's time to be a little more flexible."
