"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, he's effectively offering me a smaller share of the original $100.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the money worth 48.8% less for Bob, he's effectively offering me a much larger share of the original $100.

I'll accept this offer. I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in future rounds, and 70 is a good chunk of the remaining money.
