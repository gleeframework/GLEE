"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm going to propose a 95/5 split in my favor. This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see how Bob reacts to it. Since the money is worth less each round, I want to maximize my gains in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unreasonable. While I understand that the value of the money has decreased for me due to inflation, I'm still better off rejecting this offer and making my own in the next round. I'll need to find a better balance to ensure I get a fair share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal for me considering the inflation. I think this offer is fair enough that Bob might accept it, and it still gives me a decent chunk of the money."
