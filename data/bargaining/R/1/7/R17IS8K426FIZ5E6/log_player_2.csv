"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in your best interest, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand the time pressure, Alice, but your offer was far too low. This is more reasonable.""}
```

Explanation:

* **Reasoning:**  I need to act quickly due to the inflation heavily impacting my potential gains. However, Alice's offer was far too skewed in her favor. I'm proposing a split that's still advantageous to her but gives me a significantly larger share. 
* **Strategy:**  By making a counter-offer that's more balanced but still slightly favors Alice, I'm hoping she'll see it as a fair compromise and accept to avoid further losses on my end (which would ultimately hurt her potential gains too in future rounds)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This offer is a compromise, take it while you still get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. The inflation makes further negotiation pointless.  Let's end this.""}
```

Explanation:

* **Reasoning:**  The inflation is starting to severely eat into my potential gains. While Alice's offer is tempting, I believe holding out for one more round is worth the risk. 
* **Strategy:** I'm sending a clear message to Alice:  this is my final offer. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is still favorable to her, but reflects the urgency of the situation due to the inflation. This approach aims to pressure her into accepting, as further delays will only result in a worse outcome for both of us."
