I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the first to propose and want to maximize my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
``` 

I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. Since Bob rejected my previous offer and I am now making the offer again, I am trying to be more reasonable while still aiming for a good outcome."
