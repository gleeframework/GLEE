"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be reasonable. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. Accepting it would have left Bob with a significantly smaller share. 
* **Countering with a more balanced offer:**  While still aiming for a slightly better outcome than a 50/50 split, Bob's offer acknowledges the impact of inflation on his potential gains. 
* **Strategic Messaging:** The message aims to appear reasonable and willing to compromise, potentially swaying Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than risk further devaluation of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with this offer. It's better for both of us to settle now. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice's offer is getting worse for Bob with each round. While she claims generosity, the decreasing value of the money means Bob is continually losing ground. 
* **Leveraging Inflation:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, even if it's at a slower rate. Her eagerness to settle implies she understands the diminishing returns of dragging the negotiation.
* **Calculated Risk:** Rejecting this offer is a gamble. However, it sends a strong message that Bob won't accept a continuously shrinking portion. This increases the chance of Alice proposing a more balanced deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest solution. Let's end this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** The longer the negotiations drag on, the less valuable the money becomes for both players, especially for Bob. 
* **Asserting Firmness:**  By proposing a 50/50 split and declaring it his final offer, Bob sets a clear boundary and signals his unwillingness to accept anything less.
* **Appeal to Logic and Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair. Highlighting this, combined with the shared threat of inflation, strengthens Bob's position and urges Alice towards a swift resolution."
