"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can adjust it later if you prefer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is far too lopsided in Alice's favor. While it's true that the money will lose value with each round, it's still worth fighting for a more equitable split.  Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
