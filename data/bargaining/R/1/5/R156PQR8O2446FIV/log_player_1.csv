"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\nI'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a reasonable starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer and the money's value will decrease for me in subsequent rounds. This way, we can both get a significant amount, and Bob might be inclined to accept, given the decreasing value of money for me.\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation factor. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\n\n### I'm rejecting this offer because it gives Bob a significantly larger share than my initial proposal, and considering the inflation factor, I'd be losing even more value in subsequent rounds if I don't try to negotiate for a better split. It's still early in the game, so I'll try to push for a more favorable division.\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n###\n\n###\nI've taken into account the inflation factor that affects me and aimed for a middle ground, slightly adjusting my initial offer to make it more appealing to Bob while still trying to maximize my gain. Given that the value of money decreases for me with each round, finding a mutually acceptable agreement sooner rather than later is in my best interest.\n###\n\nYour turn!"
