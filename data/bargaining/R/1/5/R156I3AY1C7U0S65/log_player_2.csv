**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While theoretically, I could push to round 6 hoping Alice offers more, the value decrease is accelerating.  The potential gain from another round is getting smaller while the risk of getting a worse offer remains.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly aware of the situation and leveraging it.  Her offers have been getting slightly better, but she's unlikely to accept a 50/50 split given her advantage.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** If I reject this offer, there's a real chance we reach a point where the deal is so bad (due to the value decrease) that even Alice won't propose it.  This would leave us both with nothing. 

Taking $42, while far from ideal, is the most logical choice to salvage something from this increasingly unfavorable situation."
