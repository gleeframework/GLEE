"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a big chunk of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small share to start the game. It's risky, but I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting this offer. While it's less than my initial proposal, the inflation is a real risk. A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
