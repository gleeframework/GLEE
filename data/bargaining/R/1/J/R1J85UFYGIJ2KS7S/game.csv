650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I propose I take $650,000 and you take $350,000.  This is a favorable deal for you in the early rounds.  Let's avoid the impact of inflation and close this now.",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but my offer ensures a fair deal considering the inflation we both face. This benefits us both in the long run.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, you drive a hard bargain, but time is literally money for us in this game.  I'll take a slightly smaller cut than my original offer, leaving you with $450,000.  This is better than you'll get in later rounds if you keep holding out.",Alice,3,

350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, it seems clear we both want a larger share of the pie.  I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  This reflects the fact that continued inflation hurts you more than me.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.",Bob,4,

450000.0,550000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm feeling the pinch from inflation, and I know you are too, even if it's slower.  Let's settle this now.  You get the majority share, $550,000, and we both avoid further losses.",Alice,5,
