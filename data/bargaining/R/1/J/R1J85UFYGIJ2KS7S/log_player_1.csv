# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but my offer ensures a fair deal considering the inflation we both face. This benefits us both in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, it seems clear we both want a larger share of the pie.  I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  This reflects the fact that continued inflation hurts you more than me.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.
