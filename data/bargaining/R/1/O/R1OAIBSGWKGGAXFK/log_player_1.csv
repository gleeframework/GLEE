Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it more evenly.  I'll take 60 and you can have 40.  This way we both get a fair share and avoid the risk of losing out to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
