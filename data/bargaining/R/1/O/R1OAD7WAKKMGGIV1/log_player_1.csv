Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous to Bob, but also making sure I get the majority of the money.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Accepting this offer means at least getting something, and with the inflation, holding out for more could be a risky gamble."
