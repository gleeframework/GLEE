"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $60, you get $40. It's in our best interest to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, especially for Alice, I think I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us. Here's my proposal:\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's settle before the money loses more value!""}\n\n###\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is decreasing rapidly. I'll take a small hit from my previous offer to settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm still not satisfied with Alice's offer, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for her. I think I can push for a bit more, as she's more incentivized to settle quickly due to the higher inflation rate affecting her share. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nGiven the current state of inflation, where my gain is worth 9.75% less and Alice's gain is worth 19% less than the initial value, I believe I have a stronger negotiating position. I'll make an offer that reflects this dynamic:\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""The value is dropping fast, especially for you, Alice. I think this split is more reflective of our current situation. Let's wrap this up before it gets worse!""}\n\n###\nYour turn again, Alice!"
