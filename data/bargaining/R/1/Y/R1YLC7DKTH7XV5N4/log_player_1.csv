"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. I'm taking the remaining 60% for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to start, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll get 50 * 0.9 = 45 dollars.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a fair split, and I'm happy to take 45 dollars!"
