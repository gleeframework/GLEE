Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 560000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the value of the money decreases rapidly for her. While her offer is slightly better, it's likely she will be forced to offer even more in the next round. I'm willing to bet she'll crack under the pressure of inflation soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, or I'm going for a much larger share in the next round.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to turn up the heat. Alice needs to understand I'm serious about getting a larger share, especially as her potential gain continues to dwindle. This offer is a compromise, but it heavily favors me if she considers the inflation working against her.  The threat of a much less favorable offer in the next round might be enough to get her to agree."
