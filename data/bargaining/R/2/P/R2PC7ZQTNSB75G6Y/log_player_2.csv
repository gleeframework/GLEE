# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's not fair to me that Alice gets 60% and I only get 40% just because she made the first proposal.  I want to see what kind of offer she'll make when she's facing the consequences of the inflation."

# Bob gain: 44
