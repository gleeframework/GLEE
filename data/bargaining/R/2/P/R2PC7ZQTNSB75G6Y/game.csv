50.0,50.0,Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's better for us both to cooperate and get a good share.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"I see you're willing to cooperate, but I still think I should get a bit more since I took the risk of proposing first. Let's try this slightly revised split.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,I'm willing to give you a bit more to make this deal happen.  Let's split it 55/45.  We only have a few rounds left and the inflation is going to hurt us both.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
57.0,43.0,"I see you're getting anxious about the inflation, and I am too. But I still think my initial instinct was right. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your last offer. This is a fair compromise.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to give you 40% of the remaining money, but I need at least 60% to make this worthwhile for me. We're running out of time and the inflation is getting worse. It's time to make a deal.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
56.0,44.0,"I can see the inflation is really hurting your share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I'll shave off a tiny bit from my previous offer, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or we'll both lose out.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
35.0,65.0,"This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you 35%, but the inflation is making my share worth less and less. If we don't agree now, we'll both get nothing. Time is running out.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
55.0,45.0,"I know the inflation is killing your share, but I've been consistent and fair. This is my final offer. If you reject, I'm willing to walk away with nothing rather than give in to an unfair split.",Alice,9,
