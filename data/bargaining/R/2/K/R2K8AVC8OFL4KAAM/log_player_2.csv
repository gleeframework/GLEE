"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's far too generous to Alice! While it's tempting to take $1000 right away, I have time to negotiate a much fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer accounts for the time value and gives us both a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can both do better than your last offer, Bob. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still skewed in her favor, especially considering the inflation working against her.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice. This offer is a compromise, considering the value decrease with each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly, Bob. We're both losing value with each round, and this way we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, especially considering the inflation working against Alice. Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable share, and it's not worth risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
