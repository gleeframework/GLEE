"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share now, but I think you should take it before the value of money drops too much. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
