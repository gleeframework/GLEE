"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lion's share, you get a small cut. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take the lion's share, huh?

I'm not interested in getting a small cut, so I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counterattack!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You took a big cut last time, now it's your turn to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant one, hoping he'll accept and we can move on."
