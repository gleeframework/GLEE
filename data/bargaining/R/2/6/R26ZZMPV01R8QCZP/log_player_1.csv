"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values.

Bob's offer is:

# Alice gain: $200,000
# Bob gain: $800,000

I'll accept this offer.
