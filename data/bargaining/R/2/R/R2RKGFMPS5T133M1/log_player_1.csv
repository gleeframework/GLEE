"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer aims to secure a large portion of the money for Alice while still giving Bob a significant amount, hopefully making him accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is still significantly less than what Alice was offered in the first round, even with inflation considered. By rejecting, Alice can force Bob to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

Alice is now in a stronger position, as Bob's offer was rejected. This offer is still favorable to Alice, but is more balanced and could be more appealing to Bob considering the inflation he is facing. It also leaves room for negotiation in the next round if necessary."
