"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit unfair Alice. How about a more balanced 60/40 split?  Time is ticking, and it would be a shame to lose out due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
