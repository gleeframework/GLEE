"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering to take 80% of the money, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'm more eager to take a deal. Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, so I'm getting more desperate. Since Bob's offer is the same as in round 2, and the money is worth significantly less, I'll accept this offer to get some cash now.
