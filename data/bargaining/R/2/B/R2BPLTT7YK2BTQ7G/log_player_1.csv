"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer.  I want to maximize my share, knowing that the value of the money will decrease in future rounds.  But I'm also offering Bob a small amount, just in case he's feeling generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation makes this offer appealing. Taking 400,000 now is better than potentially getting nothing if we keep going."
