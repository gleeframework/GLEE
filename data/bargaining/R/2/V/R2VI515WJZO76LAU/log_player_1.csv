"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was unfair to me. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to end this quickly, but it needs to be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth. Accepting now cuts losses.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, but he's unlikely to accept a deal significantly worse than this one.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  If we reject this offer, there's no guarantee we can secure a better deal in the next round. Bob will be feeling more pressure from inflation and might offer even less. 

Taking the sure thing now (even if slightly less than initially hoped for) is better than risking a worse outcome due to inflation and negotiation dynamics."
