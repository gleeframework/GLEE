"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure it's a fair starting point, and I want to leave room for negotiation in case we go multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even with the inflation, 5000 is a lot less than 9000, and I'm hoping to get closer to that. I'll see what Bob proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my initial demand a bit, but still keep a majority of the money.  I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to be more flexible in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm hoping to get more than $4000. I'll see what I can propose next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway, but I still want to get a better share than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer.  While the inflation is hurting my potential earnings, I'm hoping to get a better deal than this in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  With the inflation, it's clear that we need to find a middle ground, and this seems like the fairest way to do that."
