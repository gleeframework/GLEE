"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60:40 split, which is more fair than your previous offer.  Let's both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
