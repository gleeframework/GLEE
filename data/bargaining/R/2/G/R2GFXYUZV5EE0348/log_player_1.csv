Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too generous towards yourself. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that the value decreases faster for me in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
