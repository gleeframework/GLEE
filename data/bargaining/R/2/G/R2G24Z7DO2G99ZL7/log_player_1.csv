"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a decent split! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think 30$ is a bit too low for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

```

}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% inflation from the previous round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,

# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, 35$ is still a bit too low for me. I'd like to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better one next time.
