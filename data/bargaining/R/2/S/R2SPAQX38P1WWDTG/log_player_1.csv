"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob will get 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair start, Alice, but I think I can do better. Let's switch roles for a round, and see if we can find a better solution. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

Alice's gain: 40% of $100 = $40
Bob's gain: 60% of $100 = $60

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
