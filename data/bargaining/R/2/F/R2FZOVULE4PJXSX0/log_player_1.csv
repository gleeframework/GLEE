"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a more equitable split. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **Inflation is hurting Bob more than you.**  Each round, his potential gains shrink significantly more than yours.
* **Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor.** He's hoping you'll panic about the shrinking pot and accept a bad deal.
* **You have leverage.** By rejecting this offer, you force Bob to make a better proposal in the next round when the money is worth even less to him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money. This offer is still generous, but I'm adjusting to account for the decreasing value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Bob:** By decreasing your demand, you show a willingness to negotiate but keep the pressure on Bob. He's the one losing value rapidly.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Framing your offer as an adjustment due to inflation makes it seem less like a power play and more like a pragmatic response. 
* **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  While this offer is better than his, it leaves you space to potentially go down to 55/45 in the next round if he's stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this down the middle. It's the fairest option considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob has cracked:** The rapid devaluation of his potential gains has forced him to offer a much fairer deal.
* **50/50 is a strong outcome:** While you could push for a slightly higher amount in the next round, there's no guarantee Bob will offer more than 50/50 again.
* **Minimize Risk:** Accepting now locks in a good deal. Waiting for a potentially slightly better offer carries the risk of Bob lowballing you again in desperation."
