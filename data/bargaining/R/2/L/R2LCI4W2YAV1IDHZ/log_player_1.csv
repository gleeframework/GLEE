"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
``` 
 
I'll propose to take nearly everything, leaving Bob with just $1. Since inflation is a factor, it's better to get as much as possible now, hoping Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 500,000 now, as inflation could reduce the value of the money in future rounds."
