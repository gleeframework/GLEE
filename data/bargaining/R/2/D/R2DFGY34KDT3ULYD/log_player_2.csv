Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing fast! I'll take $65, leaving you with $35.  It's better than what you'll get in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth isn't helping anyone. I'm taking a small hit here at $55, giving you $45.  Let's be smart and take the deal before the money shrinks even more.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out!  I'm offering you $40, I take $60.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation, we need to agree soon! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with the significant inflation, accepting $40 now when I was aiming for $55 is too big a loss. While the pressure is on with the shrinking pot, Alice is clearly feeling it too and is unlikely to let the game run out to a stalemate.  I need to hold firm a bit longer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. The pot is shrinking fast for both of us. I propose a fair 50/50 split. Take it before it's too late!""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

The increasing inflation rate is becoming a significant factor. While I was aiming for a slightly higher share, a 50/50 split ensures I get a reasonable amount before the money loses too much value. This offer also highlights the urgency of the situation to Alice, making it more likely she'll accept."
