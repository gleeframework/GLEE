60.0,40.0,Let's make a deal! I propose I take $60 and you take $40. It's a fair split that lets us both benefit before inflation eats away at the value.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I think a more balanced split is fair, considering we both lose value with each round.  Let's try 55 for me and 45 for you.",Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,"Bob, we're losing valuable time! My last offer was generous, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll take $58, leaving you with $42.  Let's close this deal before inflation hurts us both further.",Alice,3,
