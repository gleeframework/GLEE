Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

This is a classic example of the Ultimatum Game with the added pressure of inflation. While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. 
* **Alice's Pattern:** Alice seems to be sticking to a strategy of maximizing her gain, even if it means a smaller overall pot.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Alice that I'm willing to risk it all for a more favorable split.  

It's a gamble, but I need to make it clear that I won't accept an unfair deal just because time is running out."
