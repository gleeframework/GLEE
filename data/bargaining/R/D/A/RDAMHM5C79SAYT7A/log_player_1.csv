"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's just get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering the offer, I think I'll take it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it's still a decent split, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come."
