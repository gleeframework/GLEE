"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite reasonable, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round. I'll accept this offer.
