I propose to take 900,000$ and give 100,000$ to Bob. This is a fair offer, as it gives me the majority of the money, while still giving Bob a significant amount.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is not fair. While he is still taking the majority, he's offering me less than what he offered me in the first round, despite the fact that my money is worth 20% less. I will reject this offer and propose my own in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 800,000$ for me, and 200,000$ for Bob. This accounts for the inflation we've experienced, and while I'm still taking the majority, it's a more reasonable offer than the 900,000$ I proposed previously. I hope Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
