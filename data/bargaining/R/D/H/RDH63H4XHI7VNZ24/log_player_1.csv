"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 90% and you can take 10%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money I gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... A 50/50 split is a good compromise, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the remaining value of the money.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money I can gain by another 10%, so now I can gain 81% of the original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm proposing a 81/19 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money I can gain. Now I can only gain 73.1% of the original value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 73.1% of the remaining value, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll think about it for a moment...
