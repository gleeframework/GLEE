"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's see if we can agree on a compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of the original amount, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of the original amount.

I'm willing to compromise, and a 50-50 split seems reasonable. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
