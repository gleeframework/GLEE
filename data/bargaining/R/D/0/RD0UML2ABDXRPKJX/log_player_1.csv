"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair starting point, let's see what you think!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'd like to hear Bob's thoughts on it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a slightly better split, considering that my money is still worth the same as in the first round. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you can meet me in the middle.""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my original offer, while still being reasonable given the inflation."
