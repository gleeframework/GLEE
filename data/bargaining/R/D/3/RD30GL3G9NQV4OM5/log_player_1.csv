"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation impact on both of us. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation impact, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than my initial one. However, I'd like to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 4600, but I need a bit more""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4600,
  ""bob_gain"": 5400,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, don't try to negotiate, it's a fair deal""
}
```

I'm sticking to my previous message, but adjusting the numbers to reflect the inflation. I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still getting the majority of the money."
