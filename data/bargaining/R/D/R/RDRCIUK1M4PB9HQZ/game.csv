7500.0,2500.0,I propose we divide the money in a 3:1 ratio. This allows us to share a fair portion while also providing a larger sum for you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the value of the money is decreasing for both of us with each round.  We can end this game now and avoid any further losses.,Bob,2,
