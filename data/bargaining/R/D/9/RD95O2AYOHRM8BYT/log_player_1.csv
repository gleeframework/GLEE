"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'll still give you a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's the king of the jungle, does he?

I'll think about it... Ah, I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. I'm not going to let Bob take the lion's share without a fight!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make a new proposal!

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a better deal than his last offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a fair compromise. I'm giving Bob a smaller share, but it's still a decent amount, and I'm keeping a bigger chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not convinced.

I'll think about it... Ah, I'll reject this offer. I don't think I'm getting a fair deal, and I'd rather wait for a better proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make another proposal!

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 40%.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal than the 40% he offered me last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to get the upper hand, but I'm not convinced.

I'll think about it... Ah, I'll reject this offer. I'm not comfortable with giving Bob a 60% share, especially with the inflation eating away at the value of the money. I'd rather wait for a better proposal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal than the previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise."
