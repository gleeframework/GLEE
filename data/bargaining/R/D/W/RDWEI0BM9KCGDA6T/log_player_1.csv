"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original $100. I'll get $80, which is 80% of the original $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to recalculate the actual amounts:

My gain would be 45 * 0.9 = 40.5
Bob's gain would be 55 * 0.95 = 52.25

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this split, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need a bit more for myself. Think about it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $65, which is 65% of the original $100, and I'll get $35, which is 35% of the original $100."
