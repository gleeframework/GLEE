"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 0% less for me, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less. This offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair one. I'll accept it.
