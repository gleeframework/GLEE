"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I need to consider that Bob's offer is actually worth 20% less than it seems.

Since Bob's offer is 50-50, and considering the inflation, I would be getting $5,000 and Bob would be getting $4,000 (20% less than $5,000).

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather get more than 50% of the original amount.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $7,000 and Bob getting $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I'm still getting a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer considering the inflation:

Since Bob's offer is 60-40, and considering the inflation, I would be getting $4,000 and Bob would be getting $3,920 (48.8% less than $7,600, which is the original 60% of $10,000).

I'll accept this offer because I'd rather get $4,000 than continue negotiating and risk getting less.
