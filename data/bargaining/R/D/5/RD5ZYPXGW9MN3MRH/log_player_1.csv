"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, it's a fair and simple proposal""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is making the proposal, he gets to set the terms, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being worth even less.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
