I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping to secure a quick win and minimize the risk of inflation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though my potential gain is significantly lower due to inflation,  I believe I can get a better deal later in the game.  Bob is being greedy, and I'm hoping he'll be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. Inflation is a factor, but I think Bob will realize that a more equitable split is in his best interest, especially as the rounds progress."
