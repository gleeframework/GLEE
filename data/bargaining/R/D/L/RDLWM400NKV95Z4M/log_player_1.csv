"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This is a fair offer in my opinion, as it gives Alice 90% of the money.  I believe that Bob will accept this offer, as he's getting something. However, I'm aware of the inflation and hope that he doesn't reject it, as that could lead to less money for both of us in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer gives me significantly less than my original proposal, it's better than getting nothing. Since the inflation is only affecting me at this point, accepting this offer means getting at least some value, even if it's less than I initially wanted."
