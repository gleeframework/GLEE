I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob.  I figure I can still get a good chunk of the money, and this should encourage him to accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my offer in the first round, especially since the money is worth less now.  I'm not going to accept that.  I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still offer a significant amount to Bob. I'm hoping he sees that I'm willing to compromise, and we can reach a deal before the money depreciates further."
