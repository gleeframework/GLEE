"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can take 20%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money to start with, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'd rather have more money now and deal with the consequences later. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll aim for a bigger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easily, Bob. I'll give you 40% this time, but I'm taking the majority.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's try to be a little more reasonable. I'll take a little less than you this time, but we can both get closer to an even split. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob is being reasonable yet. I'd rather aim for a bigger share now while I can. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get as much as I can. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I'll give you 30% this time, but I'm taking the lion's share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's compromise.  I'm willing to take less than what I proposed before.  It's in our best interests to reach an agreement before we both lose too much to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be more reasonable now. I'm not sure if I should trust him, but the offer is tempting. I'd rather have a smaller share now than risk losing even more to inflation.
