"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... With inflation, my gain of $5,000 is worth $4,500 now, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is still worth $5,000. I'm not sure if I should take this offer, but I think I'll take it for now. It's a 50-50 split, after all!
