Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation rate.  Let's make this quick, so we both get the most value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
