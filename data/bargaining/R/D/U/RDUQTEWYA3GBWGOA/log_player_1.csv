I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the offer is tempting, I'm not sure Bob will keep offering such a high share in the next rounds. I'll hold out for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, hoping that Bob will accept before the inflation hits him too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a tough one.  While the offer is still decent, I think Bob is getting greedy.  I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round, especially with the increasing inflation affecting Bob's share more heavily."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

It's time to go for a more even split.  I think Bob's desire to win the game will push him to accept this offer.  The inflation will continue to eat away at his potential gain, and he knows that if he rejects, he'll be making the offer in the next round with even less money to work with."
