"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, let's start with 80% for me and 20% for you.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, as it still favors Bob more than I'd like. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I need to get closer to my target. Meet me halfway?""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, while still giving Bob a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are catching up!

Considering the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is a good deal for me, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve a bit more. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out against inflation."
