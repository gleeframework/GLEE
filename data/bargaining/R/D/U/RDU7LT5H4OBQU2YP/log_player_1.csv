"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. This way, we both get a significant portion of the money, and we can still negotiate further if we want to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, Alice. It's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amounts I would get in this round are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250
* Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250

I don't think a 50/50 split is a bad idea, considering the reduced value of the money. I accept Bob's offer.
