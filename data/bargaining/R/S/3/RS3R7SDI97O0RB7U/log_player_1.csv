"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It gives me a large share, but it also leaves Bob with a small amount, which might make him feel like he has some incentive to accept. We'll see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the first round, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm sticking with a strategy of offering a slightly smaller share to Bob than in round 1. The inflation will likely make him more motivated to accept as we progress."
