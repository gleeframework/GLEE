"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5 
# Alice gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 5$ for me and 95$ for her, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Considering the inflation rate, I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll aim to get a larger share now. However, 15$ is still a decent amount, considering the reduced value.

I'll accept this offer.
