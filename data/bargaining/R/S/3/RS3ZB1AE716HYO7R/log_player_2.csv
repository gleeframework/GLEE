"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that time is money for both of us, but the inflation hits me harder. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I should aim to delay the agreement to get a larger share. Conversely, for Alice, the money is worth 20% less in each subsequent round, which means she will be more inclined to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Given that we're currently at the first round with plenty of room for negotiation and no immediate pressure of the inflation affecting the current offer significantly, rejecting this initial offer seems like a strategic move to potentially increase my share. Additionally, accepting the first offer without any counter might be perceived as undervaluing my position in the negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to adjust the split further in my favor due to the differing impacts of inflation on our gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nGiven that the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, but 20% less for Alice, my strategy is to make an offer that slightly adjusts the split in my favor compared to Alice's initial offer, while still being mindful of the pressure inflation puts on both of us. Since we're in the early rounds, there's room for negotiation without the drastic effects of inflation heavily influencing our decisions yet.

""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, I've adjusted the split. Your urgency should be higher than mine, but there's room for both to benefit more than the initial offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a tough negotiation, but let's be realistic. The inflation is eating away at the value, especially for me. I'm willing to adjust my position slightly, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: At this stage, despite the effects of inflation, Alice's offer doesn't significantly improve my position from the initial offer, considering the strategic advantage I gain from each round's inflation differential. The fact that Alice is willing to adjust her position indicates there's still room for negotiation. Given the money is worth 19% less for me but 36% less for Alice compared to the first round, the pressure is mounting more on her side. Rejecting this offer and proceeding allows me to leverage this increasing pressure in hopes of securing a more favorable split in the next round. Additionally, accepting an offer that doesn't substantially improve my gain from the initial proposal might indicate I'm not fully utilizing my negotiating leverage."
