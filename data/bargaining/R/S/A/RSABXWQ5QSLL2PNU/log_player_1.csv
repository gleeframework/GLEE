"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. I believe this is a fair offer, considering I am the one making the first proposal and the money is still worth its full value. I am also taking into account that the money will be worth less for me in subsequent rounds due to inflation. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here.\n\n### AI: Round 1\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this is more equitable. Think it over. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems more equitable from his perspective, I have to consider the impact of inflation on my gain. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I would effectively be getting less than 40% of the original value. I believe I can make a better offer in the next round that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me.\n\n### AI: Round 2\n\nPlease let Bob know that I rejected his offer and I will make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\nIn this round, I am offering Bob 43% of the money and keeping 57% for myself. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I am adjusting my offer to account for the decrease in value. I believe this offer is still fair and reasonable, considering the impact of inflation on my gain.\n\n### AI: Round 3\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! Let's settle this - this offer is fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob seems more reasonable now, especially considering the significant impact of inflation on my gain. With the money being worth 14.26% less for me than in the first round, getting 450,000 dollars is effectively less but still a considerable amount. Given that time is running out and we only have a limited number of rounds left, I am inclined to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds.\n\n### AI: Round 4\n\nPlease let Bob know that I have accepted his offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
