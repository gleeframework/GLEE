"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and we can adjust as we go! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""You were too greedy, let's try a more balanced split this time""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point.  Let's try 55/45. This is closer to your proposal but still keeps things reasonable given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
