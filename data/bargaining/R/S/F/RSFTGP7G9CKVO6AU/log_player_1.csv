"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a generous offer considering we're starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my offer, so I'll try to get a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I was hoping for a better deal, but I suppose I have to be realistic.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no need to fight for more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer considering the current state of the game."
