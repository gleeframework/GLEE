}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I want more for myself. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money, I need to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too low for me, Bob. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60% share for myself, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I'll give you a 50/50 split. Will you accept this offer? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant decrease in value of the money, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. A 50/50 split is a fair deal. Let's settle on this.""
}
```

I think it's time to accept the offer and divide the money evenly."
