"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 seems reasonable""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 20% is a small share, and I'd like to aim for a more balanced split. I'm not willing to accept this offer just yet. It's my turn to make a new proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced values due to inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting $45 and Bob getting $55. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on the values!

Considering the reduced values, I'll evaluate Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I still think I'm being offered a relatively small share. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. It's my turn to make a new proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the reduced values due to inflation, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which I think is a more reasonable and balanced proposal. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
