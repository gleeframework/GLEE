Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite ungenerous.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This considers the time value of money with the ongoing inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and this back-and-forth isn't productive. I'm willing to compromise slightly. Let's split the difference - 55% for me and 45% for you.  This accounts for the inflation disadvantage you're facing while still being fair.
