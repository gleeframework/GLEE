Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, taking into account the inflation impact. I believe this is a fair offer, as the inflation rate will be more impactful on you in the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on you, I think 55/45 is a fair split now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a 60/40 split, the inflation is hitting me hard.  Accepting this offer guarantees me something, and the 55/45 split is not terrible considering the circumstances."
