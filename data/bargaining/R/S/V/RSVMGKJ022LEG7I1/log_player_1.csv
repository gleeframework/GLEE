"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 
I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $9,000 and Bob getting $1,000. I figure this is a fair starting point, and gives Bob some incentive to accept.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I was initially proposing.  Since I only lose 10% of my potential gains each round, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share slightly, but still offering Bob a decent amount.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, while also ensuring I get a good portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my initial proposal, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Inflation is definitely biting, but I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still holding firm on getting at least 70% of the money.  We're running out of time, and Bob has already rejected several of my proposals. I'm hoping he'll recognize that it's better to take a decent deal now than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but so is my share due to inflation.  I'm still determined to get at least 50% of the money.  I'm not willing to settle for this low of an amount, especially considering the time we have left.  I'm going to stick with it and see if I can still reach a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  This is my last attempt to get a deal that gives me at least 50% of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that we both need to compromise to get something at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. Even though I'm losing a large amount due to inflation, I'm still not willing to accept a deal that gives me less than 50% of the money.  I'm hoping he'll reconsider his position, but I'm prepared to risk getting nothing to hold out for a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only a few rounds left, the pressure is mounting.  I'm willing to split the money evenly now. This feels like the best possible outcome at this point, considering the inflation rate and Bob's stubbornness.  Hopefully, he'll see the sense in this and we can finally end this game."
