I'm going for a high share in the first round, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept quickly.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and while the inflation rate is hurting me more than him, I'm not yet desperate enough to accept. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I've adjusted my offer slightly to make it more appealing to Bob, given his rejection in the previous round. The inflation rate is starting to bite, so I need to find a balance between securing a good deal for myself and avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation is really starting to hurt. Bob's offer is still significantly less than my initial proposal, but it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. I'm accepting this offer to avoid losing even more money to inflation in the coming rounds."
