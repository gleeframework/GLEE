I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it allows for a good margin for negotiation in future rounds if Bob chooses to decline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'm willing to concede a bit to avoid further inflation, but I still believe a 55/45 split is fair given the value of the money has decreased."
