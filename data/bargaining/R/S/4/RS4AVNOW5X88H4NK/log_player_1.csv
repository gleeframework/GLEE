Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you less, you can take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

After considering Bob's proposal, I've decided to:

{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $400,000 while Bob gets $600,000. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
