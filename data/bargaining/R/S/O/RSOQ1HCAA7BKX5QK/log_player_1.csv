Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is a fair compromise, considering the potential loss of value in future rounds. This offers a better share for me while still being reasonable for you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
