"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I am taking the risk of being rejected and having to wait for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher percentage, the inflation makes accepting Bob's offer the more strategic move.  It's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I'm guaranteed to lose money due to inflation."
