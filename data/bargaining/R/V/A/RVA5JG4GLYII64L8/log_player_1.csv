"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest.  I'm feeling generous, so I'll even give you a little extra on top. Take it before inflation eats away at it! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
