"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. No need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'd be getting $3800 (4000 * 0.95).

I'll reject this offer and make a new one in Round 3. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm looking for a bit more. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal, while still leaving room for Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. You can't get a better deal than this! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'd be getting $4300 (5000 * 0.8554) in Round 1 terms, but since the money is worth 5% less in each round, in Round 4 terms, my gain would be $4300 * 0.95 = 4077.

I'll reject this offer and make a new one in Round 5. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit too greedy, Bob. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. This is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and protecting my own interests."
