 I'm starting with a very lopsided offer,  Alice. I'm hoping Bob will be  too eager to take any money at all to think about a more even split.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject his offer.  Let's see if he's willing to budge in the next round.  I'm still hopeful we can come to a fairer deal."

Round 3

This time, I'm offering Bob a larger share.  I hope this shows him I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't be taken advantage of. Let's see if he accepts."

Bob is being stubborn. I'll reject his offer again.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of.  Let's see what he does in the next round."
