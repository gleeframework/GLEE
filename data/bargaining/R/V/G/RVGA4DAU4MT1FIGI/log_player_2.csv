It's a good start, but let's see if we can get a better deal! I'm not convinced it's truly fair considering the inflation impact. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer considering the inflation impact on us both. Let's make this quick and end the game.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You tried to lowball, now it's my turn. Inflation hurts you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is right, inflation is hurting me more, and her offer is pretty fair considering that. I'll take it."
