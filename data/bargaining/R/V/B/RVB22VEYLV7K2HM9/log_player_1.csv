"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I can do better. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer. Since the money is now worth 20% less for me, I'd like to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this round, Bob's offer of 500,000 for both of us is equivalent to 400,000 in the first round, which is a 50-50 split. Considering the reduced value of money, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
