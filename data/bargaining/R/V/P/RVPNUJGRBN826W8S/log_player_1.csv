"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us going""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $5,000 * 0.8 = $4,000
* Bob's gain: $5,000 * 0.95 = $4,750

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is still a decent one, but I think I can do better. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I need to make up for the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message explains my reasoning for the smaller share for Bob."
