"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid unnecessary negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not getting a good deal. I was hoping for a 50/50 split, and now I'm being offered 40% of the total, which is less than I initially proposed. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll propose a slightly smaller amount for myself to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take a toll on the money's value. I need to be careful not to give up too much. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the difference between our proposed amounts is too large. I was hoping for a more even split, and this offer still favors Bob too much. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation. I'll need to be more aggressive in my proposal to get a fair deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think this is the minimum I'm willing to accept.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm also leaving some room for Bob to negotiate. The money is worth less and less with each passing round, so I need to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think this is the maximum I'm willing to give up. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. I'm starting to feel the pressure. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's still too skewed in Bob's favor. I'm not getting a fair share, and I'm starting to worry that I'll be left with almost nothing if I don't get a better deal soon. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth significantly less now due to inflation. I'll need to be very careful with my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, but I'm willing to give you a bit more if you meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm also trying to be realistic about the value of the money at this point. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair compromise and accept it."
