"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, I'll get the bigger share, you can't do better than this! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a bit risky to accept a 40/60 split right away. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to give up a bit more to get the deal done before inflation kicks in."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm offering you a more even split.  We can avoid inflation if we agree now.""}
