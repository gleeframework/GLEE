Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer.  It's fair considering the inflation, and I think it's time to settle this.

# Bob gain: 7000

Even though it's a significantly worse deal than my initial proposal, the inflation has eroded my potential gains so much that accepting this offer is the best option.  I'd rather get something than nothing."
