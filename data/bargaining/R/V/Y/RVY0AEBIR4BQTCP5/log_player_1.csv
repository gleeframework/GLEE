"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to keep him interested in continuing the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. In this case, Bob's offer is more attractive than mine was in the first round, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
