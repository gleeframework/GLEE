"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take almost everything, leaving Bob with just a dollar.  Since I'm playing as Alice, I want to maximize my share.  But I need to make sure Bob accepts my proposal to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds.  I figure a single dollar is enough for him to agree in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to have more, the inflation makes it risky to keep rejecting offers.  It's better to get 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
