Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, it's clear Alice is unwilling to budge significantly. Taking this offer guarantees me a decent share and avoids the risk of losing even more in future rounds."
