"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, which seems like a fair split to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer, considering we have a lot of rounds to go.  Let's be reasonable and get this done! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer.
