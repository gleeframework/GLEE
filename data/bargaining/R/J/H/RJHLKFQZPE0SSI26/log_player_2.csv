"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split roughly down the middle, with a slight advantage for me to start. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a good starting point, but I think I can do better. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a more balanced split is in order. Let's both get a little closer to $5000.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair deal.  Let's close this out before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's better to accept this offer and secure the gains, as inflation will only continue to erode my share."
