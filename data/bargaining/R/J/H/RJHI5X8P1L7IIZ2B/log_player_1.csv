Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself, with a message saying ""Let's split fairly""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the value of the money will decrease for me each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, but Bob's offer gives me less than my initial proposal, and considering that with each passing round, the money's value decreases for Bob but remains constant for me, I will reject this offer. This decision is based on the strategic advantage that the inflation dynamic gives me, as I can potentially get a better deal in future rounds due to Bob's decreasing valuation of the money.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'll offer Bob a bit less than before, to reflect the decreased value of the money for him, but still aiming for a compromise that might be acceptable. I'll offer Bob $350,000 and keep $650,000 for myself, with a message acknowledging the impact of inflation on his valuation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the split""}"
