{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I think we can do better. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. This accounts for the decreasing value of the money with each round, and hopefully we can reach a quick and fair agreement.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is too risky for me given the fast inflation. I propose a 55/45 split. It's a good deal considering the money is losing value quickly for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
