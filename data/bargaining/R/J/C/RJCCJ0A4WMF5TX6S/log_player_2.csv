Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While time is running out, Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the initial amount. It's a gamble, but holding out for a slightly better deal in the next couple of rounds is still the better strategy."

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a serious factor. While this offer isn't ideal, it's crucial to signal a willingness to compromise before Alice becomes completely unreasonable. It's a balance between maximizing gains and the very real risk of getting nothing."

Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is significant. Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point, as she knows time is on her side. Accepting this offer, though far from ideal, ensures we both get something, and it's better than walking away empty-handed."
