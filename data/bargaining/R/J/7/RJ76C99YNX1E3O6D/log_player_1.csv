Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is a very aggressive strategy, but since I'm going first, I want to maximize my potential gains.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round. A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm guaranteed half of the remaining value."
