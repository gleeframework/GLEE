This is a tough decision, but I have to accept. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems unwilling to budge from this split. It's unlikely he'll offer anything better in future rounds.

While I would prefer a more equitable split, taking the 40 now is better than risking a worse outcome later."
