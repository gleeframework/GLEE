75.0,25.0,I propose dividing the money 75:25 in favor of Alice. Let me know if this works for you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think a 55:45 split in my favor is fairer, given that we only have a limited number of rounds.  Let's start with this, and see how the negotiations go.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Considering the inflation, I'm proposing a 60:40 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a fair balance while accounting for the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's be reasonable.  Inflation is a factor, but we both need to compromise. I'm proposing an even split - 50/50 -  to avoid losing everything in the later rounds.",Bob,4,
