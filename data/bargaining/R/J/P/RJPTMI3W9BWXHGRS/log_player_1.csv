"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation we'll both experience in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, considering the inflation. Can you meet me at 55/45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll! Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll aim to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 55/45 is a more balanced split. Can we agree on that?""
}
```"
