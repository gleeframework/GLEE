Let's start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
```

I'll increase my proposed gain slightly to see if I can sway Bob.  I'm not sure if he's just being greedy or if he's actually trying to get a better deal for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer. It's getting increasingly unfair, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm going to raise my proposed gain again.  It's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers, but I think I can still get a slightly better deal than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting worse and worse. I'm starting to think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in just yet.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to gamble and propose a higher gain for myself. I'm taking a risk, but with inflation, it's important to try to get as much as possible as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm starting to lose too much with inflation. Even though this is a very bad deal, it's better than getting nothing at all.  I'll accept it."
