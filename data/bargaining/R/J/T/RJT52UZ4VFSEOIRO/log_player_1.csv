"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end this game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount compared to what I'm taking ($900,000), but I'm hoping he'll be tempted by the prospect of getting something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I think I can do better than 400,000. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not good enough, I'm willing to wait for a better offer!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! This is a fair split!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both lose more with each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer. Splitting it evenly might not be the best option for me, considering the value of the money has decreased so much.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better than this offer, and the message from Bob suggests he's aware of the decreasing value of the money. I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's split it evenly. I'm done with this game!""
}
```"
