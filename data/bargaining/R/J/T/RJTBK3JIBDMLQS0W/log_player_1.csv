"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 4:1 ratio in my favor, considering the current market conditions and the risk of inflation. It's a fair offer, considering the value of the money will decrease by 5% with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
