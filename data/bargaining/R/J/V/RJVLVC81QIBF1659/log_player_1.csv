"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering you $20, and I'll get $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $80 I would gain in the first round is now worth $72.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to decide...

I'll reject this offer. I'm hoping to get more than $72.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation has taken its toll again! My previous gain of $72 is now worth $64.40 (10% less).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this one!"
