"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50. This is a fair and straightforward proposal. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a slightly bigger share, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Considering the inflation, $40 is now worth $32 (80% of $40). I'm not sure if I should accept a smaller share.

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round.
