"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

This is my first offer. I'm going for a large share, but leaving a small amount for Bob to incentivize him to accept.  I figure the inflation might make him more eager to take something now, rather than wait and risk getting less later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While I'm losing money with each round, I'm still not comfortable with a 40/60 split.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more equitable split this time, hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept. I'm still taking a larger share, but I've increased Bob's portion to 40%.  I'm hoping this is enough to convince him that further rounds are too risky."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still not comfortable with a 30/70 split, especially given the inflation that's been happening.  I'll try one more time to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With inflation hitting hard, I'm willing to compromise and go for an even split.  It's risky, but at this point, I don't think I can get a better deal. I'm hoping Bob will see that a 50/50 split is fair, given the circumstances, and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

At this point, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money.  While a 20/80 split is far from ideal, it's better than nothing, and there's a strong risk that further rounds will result in an even worse offer.  I'll accept and end the game."
