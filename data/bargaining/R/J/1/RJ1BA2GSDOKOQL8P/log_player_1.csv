"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a classic negotiation game. Since I'm playing as Alice, I'm trying to maximize my share of the money.  By offering Bob a small amount, I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of getting less in the future due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While my share is worth 10% less, Bob's is only worth 5% less. This means his offer is actually more favorable to him than it was in the first round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer means I get to make the next proposal, but I'm not guaranteed a better deal. Inflation will continue to devalue the money, and Bob might make an even less favorable offer in the future.
* **Strategic Thinking:** Accepting this offer allows me to secure a decent share of the money. It's better than potentially getting nothing or a much smaller amount in future rounds."
