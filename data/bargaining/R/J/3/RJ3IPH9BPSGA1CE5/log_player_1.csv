"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to reject my offer so quickly.

Considering the inflation, my initial $900,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $720,000. Bob's offer is still less than that.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more attractive offer this time.

Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000, which is a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still too high, Alice. Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to drive the price down.

Considering the inflation, my initial $900,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $480,000. Bob's offer is still higher than that.

I'll reject this offer and try to meet him halfway.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to meet Bob halfway this time.

Since the money is worth 51.2% of its original value after four rounds of inflation, I'll aim to get a share that's closer to the current value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $480,000 and Bob gets $520,000, which is a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, Alice. But I want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to negotiate.

Considering the inflation, my initial $900,000 is now worth 32.77% of its original value, which is approximately $292,190. Since Bob's offer is higher than that, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get closer to the current value of the money.

Since the money is worth 32.77% of its original value after six rounds of inflation, I'll aim to get a share that's closer to that value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 292190,
  ""bob_gain"": 707810,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the real value, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $292,190 and Bob gets $707,810, which is a more realistic split considering the inflation."
