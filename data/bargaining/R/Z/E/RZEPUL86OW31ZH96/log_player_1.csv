"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money. It's risky, but with the inflation factor, I want to get as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more,  it's likely Bob will offer less in the next round due to inflation. Accepting this offer secures a decent share of the money, and avoids the risk of getting even less in the future."
