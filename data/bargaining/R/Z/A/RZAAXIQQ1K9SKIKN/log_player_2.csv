"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here, Bob. I'm offering you a small share to start with, but we can always negotiate in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is technically not bad in the first round, it's a clear indication she's trying to take advantage of the inflation dynamic. Rejecting this offer sets a precedent for future negotiations and shows Alice that you're not afraid to play the game strategically."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid any potential losses from the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share.  Let's split it 90/10. This way, we both get something substantial, and we avoid the risk of losing more money due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the inflation. While 100,000 is better than nothing, rejecting this offer reinforces your position that you won't be easily bullied.  It also shows Alice that you're willing to play the long game and see how the inflation impacts her decisions in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's split the money 45/55. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the inflation, and we can both walk away with a significant sum.  We're getting closer to the end, and the risk of losing more money is increasing with each round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. Inflation is getting serious. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still need the majority to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 80/20 this time. It's a better deal for you than the previous round, and it keeps us both from losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is tempting,  it's crucial to remember that inflation will continue to impact you more significantly than Alice. Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice, especially as time runs out.  You can likely secure a more favorable deal in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're nearing the end of the game. It's time to be realistic. I'm willing to accept a 40/60 split, but this is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, we both risk losing everything.""
