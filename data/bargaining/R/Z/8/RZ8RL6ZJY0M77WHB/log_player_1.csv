"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, I need to reassess the offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll consider the effective values.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 50% of the original 100$, which is 50$. However, due to inflation, this is equivalent to 40% of the original amount. So, I'll actually get 40$ in real value.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
