This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it's also fair enough to potentially be accepted in the first round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than the offer I made in the previous round, even with the inflation. I'm confident I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still keeping a significant majority of the money. I think this offer is still attractive enough to potentially be accepted, especially since Bob will see the inflation's negative impact on his share in the next round."
