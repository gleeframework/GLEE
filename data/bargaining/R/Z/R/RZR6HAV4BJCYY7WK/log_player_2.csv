I'll reject this offer. While it's a ""fair"" split right now, the money will be worth significantly less to me in the next round.  I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's message emphasizes ""generosity,"" the offer is still significantly worse for me than my previous proposal. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm still hoping to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject and see what Alice offers next."
