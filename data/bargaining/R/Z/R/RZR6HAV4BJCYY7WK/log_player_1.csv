"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. I've attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so we can consider it a reasonable offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision in the format:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept"" or ""reject"", ""message"": ""optional message from Bob""}\n\n###\n\nIf Bob rejects the offer, I'll be happy to proceed to the next round and receive his counteroffer. Remember to apply the inflation rates correctly, as the money's value decreases with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation rate.  Let's end this and get our money! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject the offer. Considering the inflation rate, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll take that into account when making my next offer.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision and we can proceed to the next round. Remember to apply the inflation rates correctly, as the money's value decreases further with each round. I'll make sure to take that into account when making my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll take into account the inflation rates. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and 10% less than in the first round (5% + 5%), I'll adjust my offer accordingly. The money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and 40% less than in the first round (20% + 20%), so he might be more eager to accept a deal.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a generous offer""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $3000 and keep $7000 for myself. Given the decreasing value of money, I believe this is a reasonable offer. I've attached a message highlighting the impact of inflation to persuade Bob to accept the deal. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision in the format:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept"" or ""reject"", ""message"": ""optional message from Bob""}\n\n###\n\nIf Bob rejects the offer, I'll be happy to proceed to the next round and receive his counteroffer. Remember to apply the inflation rates correctly, as the money's value decreases further with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. We both lose money with each round, so this is the best outcome for us both. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept the offer. Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of money, I think splitting the amount evenly is a reasonable decision. The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so we're both losing value with each passing round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nBy accepting this offer, we can both walk away with a decent amount, considering the circumstances. It's time to end the game and minimize further losses due to inflation. Please let me know the outcome of my decision."
