"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a good starting point, as it's fair while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take what I can get than risk losing everything in future rounds."
