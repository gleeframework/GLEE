"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a very small share right away, or if he wants to risk waiting and potentially getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm going to offer slightly less than my previous offer, but still a very high percentage for myself.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm not going to budge much and that he's better off accepting this offer than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more reasonable, but I'm still holding out for a larger share. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly. I'm trying to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise but I'm not going to give in too easily.  I'm hoping he'll start to realize that the risk of waiting and potentially getting nothing is outweighing the potential benefit of getting a slightly better deal in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not convinced that Bob's offer is good enough, even with the inflation affecting his gain. I'm going to keep holding out for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer once again, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. I'm hoping that the pressure of dwindling time and inflation will convince Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally getting close to what I'm willing to accept. Although the inflation has significantly lowered the value of what Bob is receiving, it's not worth risking getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds. I'll accept this offer."
