"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but it's still a good start! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob taking a larger share, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that he'll be more generous in future rounds.
