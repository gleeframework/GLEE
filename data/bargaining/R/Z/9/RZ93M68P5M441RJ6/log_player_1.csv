"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I'm going to be greedy and try to get most of the money. I'll offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing a significant amount compared to my initial proposal, accepting this offer ensures I get at least some money.  The inflation means the money will be worth less each round, and there's a chance Bob could get even more greedy in future rounds."
