450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time and the deal is getting worse for both of us every round.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's more than your last offer but gives us both something substantial before inflation eats away at it further.",Bob,4,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's be reasonable - I'm dropping my offer to 52/48.  This is a fair compromise considering the inflation, and it guarantees we both walk away with something substantial. Don't let greed ruin this opportunity for both of us.",Bob,6,
