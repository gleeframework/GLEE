Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of money due to inflation. Alice knows time is on her side and her offers are getting greedier.  We need to hold firm and make a counter offer that shows I'm willing to negotiate but not be taken advantage of."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's be reasonable - I'm dropping my offer to 52/48.  This is a fair compromise considering the inflation, and it guarantees we both walk away with something substantial. Don't let greed ruin this opportunity for both of us.""
