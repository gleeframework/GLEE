"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I'll take 90%, and you get 10%.  We can adjust in later rounds if you think it's unfair. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While she suggests adjusting in later rounds, the impact of inflation is significant, especially for her. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Your initial offer was quite skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's be more realistic.  I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, it's crucial we reach an agreement soon. ""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference. I'm willing to give you 40% this round, but it's crucial we come to an agreement.  The inflation hurts us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation, but her offer is still not balanced. Accepting 40% now means losing a significant amount compared to what we could have potentially gained in earlier rounds.  We need to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a middle ground quickly. I'm proposing a 65/35 split. This considers the time pressure from inflation and offers a more balanced outcome than your previous offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50. It's the fairest option now with inflation biting into our gains. We both get something, and the clock is ticking. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I'd prefer a slightly higher percentage, a 50/50 split is a fair deal at this stage. The impact of inflation is significant for Alice now, making this offer the most reasonable we're likely to get. Accepting ensures we both walk away with a substantial sum."
