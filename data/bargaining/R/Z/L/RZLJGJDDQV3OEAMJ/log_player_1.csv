"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\n###\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that tries to convince Bob that this is a fair deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is worth less next round, let's be realistic. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, even considering the inflation. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share.""}\n\n###\nI'm offering a 58-42 split in my favor, trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's previous offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - it's only going to get worse for you. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer at this point. The difference between our shares is relatively small, and further rounds would only decrease the value of my share. It's time to settle and take the 4900!"
