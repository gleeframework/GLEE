I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000. This gives Bob a small but fair share, while ensuring a larger portion for myself."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to try a slightly more generous offer this time, but I still want a larger share.  Let's do an 80/20 split."

This offer is significantly less than what I initially offered. I'm willing to hold out for a better deal, hoping that Bob will realize that we both need to come to an agreement quickly to avoid losing more money."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to lower my offer again to 70/30,  but I still want a majority share. Time is running out, and the money is losing value rapidly. Let's find a compromise before it's too late."

``` 

Bob is still holding out for a larger share than I'm willing to offer. While this offer is a bit closer than the last one, I'm hoping to get more, especially considering the time pressure."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm willing to go down to 60/40.  We're getting very close to the end of the game and both of us are losing money.  I believe this is a fair split, considering we're both getting something."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a good offer, especially considering how much money is being lost due to inflation. While I'd still prefer a larger share, I'm willing to accept this to avoid getting nothing at all."
