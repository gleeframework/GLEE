"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 45 dollars and taking 55 dollars for myself. Since we're starting with a clean slate, I'm aiming for a relatively even split, but slightly in my favor. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is meant to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation factor. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in this round, accepting this offer would mean I'm actually getting less value than Bob. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\nYour turn! What's the next step?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, need a better deal!""}\n\nConsidering the 10% decrease in value for my gain in each round, I'll aim to increase my share in this proposal. I'm offering Bob 40 dollars and taking 60 dollars for myself. The message highlights the impact of inflation on my gain, hoping Bob will understand my position and accept this revised offer.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be fair, but I can't afford to lose more ground to inflation.  I'm willing to split the difference from last round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gain, which is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to reassess my strategy. Bob's offer to split the difference from the last round, giving me 45 dollars and him 55 dollars, seems more reasonable under these circumstances. Since further rounds will only continue to devalue my potential gain, I'll accept this offer to secure some value rather than risking further loss to inflation.\n\nYour turn! What's the next step?"
