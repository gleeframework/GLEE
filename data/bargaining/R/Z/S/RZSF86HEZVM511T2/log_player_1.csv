I'm offering you $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  It's a pretty good deal for me, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm offering you $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. This is a more balanced split than the previous offers, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Remember, inflation keeps eating away at the value of the money, so it's in both of our best interests to settle soon!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer.  Although I'm getting a smaller share than I'd prefer, the inflation is becoming too much of a factor to risk another round. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all."
