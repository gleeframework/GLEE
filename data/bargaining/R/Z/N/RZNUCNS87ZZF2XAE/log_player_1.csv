# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision. With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to consider that.

I'll reject this offer for now. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! The inflation is biting, and my gain is worth significantly less now.

I'll think carefully before making a decision. However, I notice that Bob's offer is similar to his previous one, and I'm not seeing any significant concessions from him.

I'll reject this offer as well:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting now! My gain is worth a significant fraction of what it was initially.

I'll think carefully before making a decision. While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous ones, I'm still not convinced it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer as well:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a 50/50 split, which is a pretty reasonable offer considering the current state of the economy. With inflation taking such a huge toll, I'm not sure I can do better than this.
