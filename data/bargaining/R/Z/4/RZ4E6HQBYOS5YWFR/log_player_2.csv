I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get the most out of this deal.  While a 60-40 split sounds fair,  I'll reject and see if Alice will offer me more in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is a reasonable split considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject. Even though Alice is offering slightly more than the initial 60-40 split,  it's still not a good deal for me considering the inflation is hitting me harder than it is hitting Alice.  I'm hoping I can get her to budge even further in the next round."

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is slowly coming down in her offer, but it's still not a good deal for me. I'm going to keep pushing for a better split. It's risky, but with inflation hitting me so hard, I need to get a bigger share to make it worthwhile."

Alice is getting desperate, but I'm still going to reject. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but I know I'm running out of time. The inflation is hurting me badly, but I'm determined to get a bigger share."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm going to keep pushing for a higher percentage. With each round, the risk of losing everything increases, but I'm still hopeful that I can secure a substantial share."
