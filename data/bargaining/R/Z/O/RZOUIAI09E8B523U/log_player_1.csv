"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%. This seems like a fair starting point to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, and Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money. In this case, I'll get $40 (50% of $80, which is 20% less than the original $100) and Bob will get $40.

I'll accept this offer.
