"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it evenly!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but I'm not being generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob's offer is worth 10% less than the original amount, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that the next round will bring a more favorable outcome.
