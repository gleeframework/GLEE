# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small share and we can be done with this! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice proposes next!  I want a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. This is a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we should aim for a more balanced split. How about 60/40 in my favor this time? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split,  the inflation is going to hurt me more in the long run.  It's time to take what I can get."
