"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While it seems like a lot of money, I'm losing value every round. I need to aim for a much better split in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. Time is money, and my time is worth more this round.  This offer gives you a fair share."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this deal is still good for both of us.  Let's be smart and settle now. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is barely budging while my potential earnings are eroding! I need to hold firm and aim for a much better split, even if it means going into later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, this offer is more than generous considering my diminishing returns.  Let's wrap this up and both walk away with something."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is a compromise, but it's the best you'll get at this point. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous! While Alice's offer is slightly better, it's still unacceptable. The longer she waits, the more desperate I become, and she knows it. I need to show her I'm willing to risk it all to get a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. I'm not backing down."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this stage. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It pains me to accept this after holding out for so long, but with the current inflation rate, getting 50/50 is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
