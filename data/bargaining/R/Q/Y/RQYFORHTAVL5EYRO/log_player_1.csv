"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept and we can split the cash, or you can try to negotiate for more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. The offer is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast, Bob! You're trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll pass on this one.""
}
```

I don't think splitting it evenly is fair, considering the inflation has already reduced my potential gain. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best deal, Bob. This is my final offer before things get really ugly.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, offering Bob a smaller share, but still giving him a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to accept being taken advantage of. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the current value, I'd be getting only about 480,000 in real terms. Bob's offer is still a bit too low, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, Bob, but I think I can do better. I'm not giving up yet.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one."

  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any younger, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not budging much.""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, considering the inflation has reduced my potential gain even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, I'm getting a little worried about the inflation, but I'm willing to give you a bigger share if you accept this offer. Let's make a deal before things get worse for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. With the current value, I'd be getting only about 335,000 in real terms. Bob's offer is actually a bit better than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm not sure if this is the best you've got, but I'm not ready to settle yet.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob has any better tricks up his sleeve."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. This is my last offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to go back to my initial strategy, offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm willing to give him a bit more than before. The inflation has reduced my potential gain so much that I need to be more aggressive to get a decent amount."

# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling my potential gain. With the current value, I'd be getting only about 160,000 in real terms. Bob's offer is actually a bit more even than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, Bob. You've worn me down. I'll accept your offer. Let's just get this over with.""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get."
