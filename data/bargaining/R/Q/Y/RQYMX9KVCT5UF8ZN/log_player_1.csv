"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the money, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is 20$. I'll take the remaining 80%. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
