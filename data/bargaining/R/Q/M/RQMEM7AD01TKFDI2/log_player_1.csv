"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is really a ""slightly better"" offer for me, considering the inflation. His gain is 20% more than mine, which doesn't seem fair. I'll reject and try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share!""
}
```

I'm trying to sweeten the deal for Bob, but still keep a slightly larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up my advantage yet 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob's offer is still not very appealing to me, considering the inflation. His gain is still 8% more than mine, which doesn't seem fair. I'll reject and try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm trying to make a more aggressive move, offering a smaller share to Bob, in the hopes that he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Wait, what? Bob is offering me a slightly bigger share, but it's actually a smaller share in real value due to inflation! Considering the offer is now worth less than my previous offer, I think I'll take it. It's not ideal, but it's better than going to the next round and risking an even worse deal."
