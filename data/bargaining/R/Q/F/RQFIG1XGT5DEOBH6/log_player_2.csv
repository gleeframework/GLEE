Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think 70/30 is a fairer split.  Let's not get greedy - if we keep rejecting each other, the value of the money will continue to decrease.  Think about it! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000
