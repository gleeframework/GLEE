"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40. Your share is higher because you're losing money faster. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While the offer is tempting, it's a risky strategy to accept so early on. I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation rate we're facing. Let's work together to reach an agreement.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a compromise.  Since we both need to account for inflation, I'm proposing 5400 for me and 4600 for you. This way, we both get a slightly higher share than the previous round. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400
