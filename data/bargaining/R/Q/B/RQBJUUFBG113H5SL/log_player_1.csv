"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 3:1 isn't too bad, is it?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 50/50 is the best way to split it. We both get a good share and there's no need for more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it 50/50? That's a bold move!

I'll have to think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to give up my potential for a larger share, especially since the money is worth the same for me as in the first round. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You could have taken the 3:1 in round 1, now you're getting 3:4. Don't be greedy, take it while you can!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but still a decent amount. Let's see if he'll take it this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go back to a 50/50 split. Your last offer wasn't fair, and I'm not going to accept anything less than equal shares. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is sticking to his guns on the 50/50 split!

However, I'm not sure if I want to give up my potential for a larger share, especially since the money is still worth the same for me as in the first round. But, I also don't want to go back to a 3:4 split, so...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not the best deal for me, but it's a fair one, and I'd rather end the game now than risk getting a worse deal later on."
