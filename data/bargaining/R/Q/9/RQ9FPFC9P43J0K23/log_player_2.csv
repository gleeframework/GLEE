Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

I'm taking a bit more for myself, hoping Alice will accept. Inflation is a factor, and I want to maximize my share!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less, it's still a better deal than what I was able to get in the previous round. Inflation is a factor, but I need to secure some money before it drops even further."
