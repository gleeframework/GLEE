"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 
I propose taking 90 dollars for myself, leaving 10 dollars for Bob.  This is a good starting point, as I'll be getting the lion's share but it's still a generous offer for Bob considering I'm the one making the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Taking 40 dollars now is better than potentially getting less in the future. I also don't want to risk losing everything by rejecting and then not being able to reach an agreement."
