"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's fair considering we're both taking a risk by rejecting the previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game.
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money's value decreases by 10% with each round. In Round 1, I offered a 60/40 split in my favor, which Bob rejected. In Round 2, Bob offered the same split but in his favor, which I rejected.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on the offers.
Given that the money's value decreases by 10% each round, what was $100 initially is now worth less. After two rounds, the original $100 is worth $100 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $81.

### Step 3: Determine a new offer considering the game's progression and inflation.
Since both initial offers were rejected, and considering the decreasing value of money, I should aim for a slightly more favorable offer to Bob to encourage acceptance while still benefiting from the game.

### Step 4: Calculate the new offer's values.
Given the decreased value of money, a direct 60/40 split might not be appealing or reflective of the game's current state. Aiming for a slightly more generous offer than before but still in my favor could be strategic.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer and message.
Offering Bob slightly more than before but ensuring I still gain a significant portion could encourage him to accept, considering the risk of further devaluation.

### Step 6: Finalize the offer and message.
Given the considerations, offering Bob 45 and taking 55 for myself seems reasonable, considering we're both taking risks and the money's value is decreasing.

The final answer is:
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground.""}"
