Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer.  I want to secure a good chunk of the money early on, and I'm confident I can make a convincing argument that this is a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer, and I'd rather not risk losing any more money to inflation."
