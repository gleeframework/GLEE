"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the initial amount. Let's negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if we can do better than the starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, my gain of $5000 is worth 95% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $4750.

I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle, but it's a good starting point for negotiations. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
