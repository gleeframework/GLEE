"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 10% less, so I would get $630,000 (700,000 * 0.9), and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he would get $760,000 (800,000 * 0.95).

I accept Bob's offer.
