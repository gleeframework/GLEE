Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  This way, we both get a good deal before inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a fair offer and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round considering inflation. It's better to take what's on the table than risk getting nothing."
