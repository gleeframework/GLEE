"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less each round, that's a challenge!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the $4,000 and hope it's the best I can get!"
