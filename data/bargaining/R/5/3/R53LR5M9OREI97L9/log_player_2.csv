Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's try this!

# Alice gain: 55

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the end.  I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need to ensure I get something reasonable. Let's settle on this. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot from her perspective. It's unlikely she'll offer anything better than this, and if we reject, we risk getting stuck with an even worse deal in the final round."
