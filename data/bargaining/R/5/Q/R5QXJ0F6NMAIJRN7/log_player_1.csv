"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering a division where I take $5,500 and Bob takes $4,500, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split, but I'm taking a bit more for myself. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer to split the money evenly because, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal for you""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a division where I take $5,800 and Bob takes $4,200. Given the effects of inflation, where the value of the money decreases by 10% for me and 5% for Bob with each round, I believe this offer is reasonable and represents a good deal for Bob, as suggested in the message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in this round. Given the significant impact of inflation, where the value of the money has decreased by 27.1% for me and 14.26% for Bob compared to the first round, I believe accepting $5,200 is a prudent decision. The difference in the amounts we gain is not substantial enough to warrant further negotiation, especially considering Bob's message that this is his final offer. Proceeding could risk a less favorable outcome due to the increasing devaluation of the money."
