{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not too thrilled about the offer. I was hoping for a more equal split, and now I'm being offered $4,000 while Bob gets $6,000. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. The money is worth less than before, and I'm being offered only $3,500 while Bob gets $6,500. I was hoping for a better deal, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."
