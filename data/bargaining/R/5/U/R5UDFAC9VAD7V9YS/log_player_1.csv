"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 70 is actually worth 56% of the original $100 (since 70 * 0.8 = 56).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. With the inflation, my gain of 60 is actually worth 48% of the original $100 (since 60 * 0.8^2 = 48).

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much yet! You're getting closer, though. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the actual value of my gain in this round. With the inflation, my gain of 55 is actually worth 55 * 0.512 (since 100 * (1-0.488) = 51.2, and 100 * 0.512 = 51.2) = 28.16% of the original $100.

I think this is a better deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
