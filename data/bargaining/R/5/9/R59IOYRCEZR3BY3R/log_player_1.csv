"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives you a large portion of the money, but also leaves some for Bob, hopefully encouraging him to accept and avoid further rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair, even with the inflation factored in.  There's a huge gap between our gains and the round has just begun! I'm not giving up this easily!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit to try to incentivize Bob to accept, but still keeping a larger portion for myself.  The inflation is starting to affect the money more each round, so I need to be careful with my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor, even considering the inflation. I'm willing to keep fighting for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but only by a small amount. I need to find a balance between getting a decent share and convincing Bob to accept. The inflation is starting to really bite, but I'm still determined to get a fair deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair, even with the significant inflation. I'm determined to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is getting more and more challenging with each passing round.  Inflation is making the money worth less and less, and I'm feeling the pressure.  But, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  This offer is a compromise, but I still believe it's fairer than the one Bob offered."
