"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a near-even split is the fairest way to divide the money, considering the shrinking value. Let's both take a slight hit to ensure we get a good share before it's worth less. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
