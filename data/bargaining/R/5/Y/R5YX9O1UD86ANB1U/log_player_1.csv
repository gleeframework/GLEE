"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###  \n\nIn this proposal, Alice is offering to take $6,000 (60% of the total) and leave $4,000 (40% of the total) for Bob. She attaches a message suggesting that this division is fair. Now, it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round to make his own proposal. Keep in mind that if Bob decides to proceed to the next round, the value of the money will decrease due to inflation, affecting both players but impacting Alice more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation rates. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### \n\nAlice decides to reject Bob's offer. Despite the impact of inflation, which makes every subsequent offer less valuable, Alice seems to believe she can negotiate a better deal in the next round or is not satisfied with the proposed split. The game will proceed to the next round, where Alice will make a new proposal, taking into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n### \n\nAlice makes a new proposal, slightly adjusting the percentages to try and meet Bob closer to the middle, considering the impact of inflation on both their potential gains. She aims to find a compromise that might be more acceptable to Bob while still favoring her side due to the higher impact of inflation on her potential earnings."
