"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground. I think 60-40 is a fair split, considering we both want to get a good share. Inflation is looming, so let's not wait too long! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
