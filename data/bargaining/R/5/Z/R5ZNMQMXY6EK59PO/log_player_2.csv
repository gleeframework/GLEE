"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get the rest.  Let's see if we can find a better balance for both of us in the future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. It's not a fair split, and I think we can find a better balance in future rounds. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get a more equitable share of the money.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn! Here's my proposal for Round 2:\n\nI'll take 60% of the money, and Alice can have the remaining 40%. This way, we both get a significant share, and we can avoid the risk of the money losing value due to inflation.\n\nLet's see what Alice thinks!"
