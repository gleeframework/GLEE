4500.0,5500.0,I'm willing to split it a little closer to the middle.  I think a 55/45 split is fair.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,I understand you want a more even split. How about we reverse your last offer? It's still a fair deal.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,Let's try a 60/40 split this time.  I think it's a good compromise and we can both walk away happy.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,This is getting us nowhere.  Let's just split it evenly down the middle and call it a day. 50/50.,Alice,5,
