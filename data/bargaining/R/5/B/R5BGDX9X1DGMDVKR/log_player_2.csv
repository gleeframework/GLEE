Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected the 50/50 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Given the 10% inflation, I'll offer a slightly larger share to Alice to incentivize her to accept.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. Given that the money I gain is worth 19% less, I'll try to adjust the offer to account for the reduced value.

However, Alice's offer is still not good enough, considering the inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 19% reduction in the value of the money I gain, I'll try to offer a slightly larger share to Alice to make up for it. However, I'll also take into account that the money Alice gains is worth 36% less, so I'll adjust the offer accordingly.
