"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money to start. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000 is actually worth 400,000 in real terms.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable as my initial offer. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer in this round is worth 80% of what it was in the first round. So, I'll aim for a more aggressive proposal to make up for the lost value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'm keeping a larger share of the money, but it's still a relatively high offer considering the circumstances. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 400,000 is actually worth 512,000 in real terms, which is a decent amount.

Considering the offer, I'm getting a smaller share of the money, but it's still a relatively fair deal. I'll accept this offer, as I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
