"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose a split of $99 for myself and $1 for Bob. This is a very uneven split, but I want to see how greedy Bob is and if he's willing to risk getting nothing at all to get a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds. It's a good compromise."
