Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I propose taking 9000 dollars and giving Bob 1000 dollars. I believe this is a fair offer as it allows us to both get a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
