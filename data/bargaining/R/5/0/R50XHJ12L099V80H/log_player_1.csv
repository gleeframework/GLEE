"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but also ensures Bob gets something. Since it's the first round, I'm taking a risk by assuming he'll accept. If he rejects, I'll have to make a more generous offer in the next round, but the money will be worth less to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better for him, it's still not a good deal for me. Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm still better off rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to give Bob a larger share than my initial offer, I still want to ensure I receive a significant portion of the money.  The inflation factor is becoming more significant, so I need to secure a good deal now before it hurts me further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt now.  Even though this offer is not ideal, it's the best I can get at this point.  The money is worth significantly less for me now, and it's likely that Bob will continue to make proposals that are increasingly advantageous to him.  I'm better off accepting this offer and getting something rather than risking getting nothing in the next round."
