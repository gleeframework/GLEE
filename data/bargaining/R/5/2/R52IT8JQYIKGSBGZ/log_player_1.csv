"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, but I still need to think strategically.

I'll reject this offer because it's a 50-50 split, and I'm not sure if I can do better in future rounds. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect, my money is worth 40% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for this.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains. With my money worth only 51.2% of its original value, I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll accept this offer because it's a 40-60 split, which is closer to my initial offer in Round 1, and I'm not sure if I can do better in future rounds.
