"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm open to adjusting if Bob has a better idea."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain would be worth 90% of the original amount, so I'd get 4500$ instead of 5000$. I'm not thrilled about the proposal, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
