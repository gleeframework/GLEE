"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk to begin with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this is a good starting offer, I believe I can get more. I'll see what Alice has to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to split the money more fairly.  This offer is still generous for you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than what you offered. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd like more, the money is losing value quickly. Accepting this offer will get me something before it's all gone."
