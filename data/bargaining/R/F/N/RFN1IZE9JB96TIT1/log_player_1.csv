"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, we can always adjust in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, leaving me with $9,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can adjust the division in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer, but not too close 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is still worth $9,000, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so it's $900.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
