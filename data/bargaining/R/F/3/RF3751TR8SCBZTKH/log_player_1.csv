"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'm taking a little less, but you're getting more.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is being entirely fair, and I'm not willing to accept a 40% share. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55% share for myself and 45% for Bob, trying to find a compromise."
