"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a little better than 60/40. Let's try 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less in this round, I'm looking for a slightly better deal.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and proceed to the next round. I think I can do better than 45 dollars."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle at 50/50, and make it a fair deal""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see it that way too!"
