"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it more evenly. Let's do 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual value of my gain in the second round is 80% of the value of my gain in the first round. 

In the first round, I offered to take $6,000. The value of my gain in the second round is 80% of $6,000, which is $4,800. 

Bob's offer is for me to take $4,000, which is less than the $4,800 I would get in the second round. 

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again due to inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of the value of my gain in the second round. 

In the second round, I would have gotten $4,800. The value of my gain in the third round is 80% of $4,800, which is $3,840.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $3,200, leaving $7,800 for Bob."
