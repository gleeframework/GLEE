"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to see if I can get a better deal.  The inflation is a risk, but I'm hoping to get more than 4000."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it more evenly. Let's do 60/40.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 6800 
# Alice gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm getting a better share than my previous offer, and with the inflation, it's likely I won't get a better deal if I reject."
