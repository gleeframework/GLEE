"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the whole thing, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

This is a pretty straightforward offer, but I'm sure Bob will reject it and we'll have to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you a small portion for now. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's see what happens next!"
