"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split. It's more reasonable considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the growing inflation effect on your end, I propose a 58/42 split. It's a more balanced offer given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**  Bob is taking advantage of the situation and offering increasingly worse deals. While the inflation is impacting my potential gains, I need to hold firm and aim for a more equitable split. Accepting a 42% share would be a significant loss, especially with 8 rounds remaining. There's still room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is a factor, but so is fairness. I'm willing to meet in the middle with a 52/48 split. This acknowledges the time pressure while still aiming for a reasonable outcome for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the substantial inflation impact on your end, I'm willing to offer a 62/38 split. This is a serious proposal considering the time constraint and the devaluation of your share. 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting greedier.  While the clock is ticking, accepting 38% would be a major loss, especially since Bob has consistently rejected offers closer to even. I need to show I'm serious about getting a fair share, even if it means risking a worse outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise.  I'm taking a significant hit from the inflation, but I'm willing to accept 48% to reach an agreement. Time is running out, and accepting this offer is the best way to ensure we both benefit.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to make a significant concession to avoid walking away with nothing. Offering 48% is still a loss compared to earlier rounds, but it's better than accepting Bob's increasingly one-sided offers or letting the clock run out.  This shows Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal while still aiming for a reasonable portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the substantial devaluation of your share and the urgency to reach an agreement, I propose a 65/35 split. This offer reflects the current state of negotiations and the impact of inflation on your potential gain. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  The situation is getting critical. Bob is clearly exploiting the inflation to his advantage, and with only 4 rounds left, the value of my share will plummet even further. Accepting 35% is a significant loss, but it's better than risking a worse offer or walking away empty-handed. It's painful, but I need to be pragmatic at this point."
