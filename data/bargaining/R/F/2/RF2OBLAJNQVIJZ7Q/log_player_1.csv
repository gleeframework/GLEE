"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from the initial sum.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  It's generally better to start with a slightly advantageous offer but not overly greedy. 55/45 split leans in my (Alice's) favor but leaves room for Bob to find it acceptable. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Bob's money doesn't devalue, so he's incentivized to wait. Alice, however, loses 20% of the pot's value each round. A decent offer upfront might make him accept rather than risk getting a smaller slice later.
* **Message:** The message aims to frame the offer as reasonable and mutually beneficial, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly worse than Alice's initial proposal. While inflation is a factor, accepting this offer would mean settling for considerably less than a fair share. Bob is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against Alice. 

It's a gamble to reject, but Alice is better off proposing a counter-offer in the next round, even with the inflation penalty, than accepting such an unfavorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob. This is a serious offer reflecting the dwindling value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Retreat:** Alice's Round 3 offer is technically less favorable than her Round 1 offer (550,000 vs 480,000). However, this is a calculated move.  Bob's aggressive stance in Round 2 suggests he may not be easily swayed.
* **Inflation Factor:** Alice acknowledges the inflation pressure by reducing her share, but not drastically. This shows she's willing to negotiate but not be exploited.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the time sensitivity due to inflation, making it clear to Bob that delaying further is not in either of their best interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle this now, Alice.  This is a good deal for both of us before things devalue further. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Harsh Reality:** Inflation has significantly eroded Alice's potential gains. While 350,000 is far from ideal, it's better than what she stands to gain if she continues to reject offers.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob is clearly playing a waiting game, knowing that time is on his side. He's unlikely to offer significantly more than this in subsequent rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a substantial risk. Another round means Alice's potential earnings decrease by a further 20%, making even a marginally better offer from Bob less appealing than the current deal.

**Conclusion:**

It's painful to accept, but Alice is better off taking the 350,000 now. Bob has successfully exploited the inflation mechanism in this game."
