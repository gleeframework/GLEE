Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one, but I'm going to accept.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less my potential share is actually worth due to the brutal inflation.  
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share, and she's winning by waiting. It's unlikely she'll offer anything significantly better in the future.

While 43 isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting even less in later rounds.
