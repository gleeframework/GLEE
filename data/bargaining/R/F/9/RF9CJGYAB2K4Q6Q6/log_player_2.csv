"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value for both of us over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current split doesn't account for the fact that the money loses value faster for me than for Alice. I believe I can get a more favorable offer in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the faster depreciation on my end, I think this split is more reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice reacts to this offer."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, our time is running out. I understand your position, but this offer accounts for the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think the offer doesn't adequately address the difference in depreciation rates. With the increasing time pressure, I'll try to negotiate a better split in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Given the time pressure and unequal depreciation, I believe this offer is more balanced. Let's settle before it's too late.""}\n\n###\n\n Hopefully, Alice will consider the urgency and accept this proposal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is becoming critical.  We both lose if we don't agree soon. I'm making a final compromise here. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant depreciation of the money, especially for me, and the risk of losing everything if we don't agree soon, I think this offer is the best I can get under the circumstances. It's time to accept and secure what's left."
