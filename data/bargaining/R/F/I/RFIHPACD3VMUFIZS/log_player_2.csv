Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to 5500, but I think that's a fair compromise considering the inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, her understanding of ""compromise"" seems skewed in her favor. The inflation is hitting her much harder than me, so waiting her out is still a good strategy. I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a lopsided deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
