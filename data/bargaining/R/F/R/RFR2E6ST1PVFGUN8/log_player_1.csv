"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob thinks I'm being too greedy!

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. With a 20% gain, I'll still get a decent amount, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the current value of $100, leaving Bob with 55%."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not giving up yet!

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll think about this new offer. With a 35% gain, I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still not sure if it's the best deal.

I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.
