"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with something. It's a risky strategy, but I hope he'll accept it to avoid the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. With each round, my share of the money will decrease due to inflation. This offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money, and any further rounds risk me getting nothing."
