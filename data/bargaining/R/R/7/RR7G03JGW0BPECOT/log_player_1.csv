"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not budging!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. My message is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping to get a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, a fair deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gains are still worth the same, but Bob's gains are worth 10% less.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair deal, and I'd like to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
