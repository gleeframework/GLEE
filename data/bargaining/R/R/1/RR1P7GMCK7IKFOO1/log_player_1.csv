"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $60, leaving Bob with $40, and attaches a message suggesting that this division is somewhat fair but slightly biased towards her."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something more reasonable. This offer leaves us both with a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or that my initial offer was more reasonable considering the progressive devaluation for Bob. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more balanced offer""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've adjusted the amounts considering the inflation impact. Since the money is worth less with each round, especially for Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us, slightly increasing my share to compensate for the loss in value but still being mindful of Bob's diminishing returns."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. This is a decent offer considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, especially with Bob facing a nearly 50% devaluation, I believe this offer is reasonable. The difference between our shares is minimal, and considering the progressive loss in value, accepting this offer seems prudent to avoid further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
