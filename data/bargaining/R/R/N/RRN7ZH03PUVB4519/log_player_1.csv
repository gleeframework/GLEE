Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to maximize my gains in the first round, knowing that the money will lose value in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
