"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80 and you can take 20. We can negotiate further if you'd like.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's avoid further rounds and settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'd rather get more now.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
Let's settle this!"
