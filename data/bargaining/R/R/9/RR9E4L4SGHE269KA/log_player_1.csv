"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me a significant majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is losing value, so I'd rather not give up as much as I did in the first round. Bob's offer is actually more favorable to me than my original offer, so I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
