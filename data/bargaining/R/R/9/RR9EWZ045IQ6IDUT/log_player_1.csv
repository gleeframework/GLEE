Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate is higher for me.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob is being pretty aggressive, and while the inflation is worse for him, accepting this offer means I lose a significant amount of potential gain. Let's see if I can get him to back down a little.
