"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, you can get the smaller share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can end the game before the inflation sets in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good one! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so my gain of 70 is equivalent to 63 in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as I could potentially get more in future rounds. But Bob's offer is still a good one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even lower value for my money.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
