"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get 6000$, you get 4000$. This way we both benefit from dividing the money early. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!  I'm going to try to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 4000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that last offer wasn't fair considering the inflation. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but we need to find a balance that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alright, let's take the offer.  We're already losing value with each round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
