"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, as I think it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair offer considering the risk of inflation 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the risk of inflation, I'd rather take the smaller share now than risk losing even more value in future rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer.
