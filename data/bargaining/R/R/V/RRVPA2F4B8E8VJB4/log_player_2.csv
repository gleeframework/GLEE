"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob!  While it's tempting to take *something*, the inflation will drastically reduce the value of that $1000 over the next 12 rounds.  It's better to try and negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
Let's start with a more balanced proposal. This gives Alice a fair amount, while still ensuring a good portion for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer more, the inflation is becoming a serious issue. This offer gives me a significant amount of money, and it's worth risking that Alice won't offer a better deal in the next round.  It's better to take the guaranteed 500,000 than risk getting nothing at all."
