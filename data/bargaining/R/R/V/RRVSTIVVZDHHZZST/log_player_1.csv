"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 5500/4500 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as it's a relatively even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is still a decent amount, and accepting avoids the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round due to inflation."
