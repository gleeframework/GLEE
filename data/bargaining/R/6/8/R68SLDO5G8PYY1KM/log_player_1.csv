"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not being greedy, I just started with a fair offer. I'd like to get a better deal than 1/10 of the remaining money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes that into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the 5% decrease in value, aiming for a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not getting desperate, I'm just trying to adjust to the changing circumstances! However, I don't think this offer is reasonable, considering the inflation has already taken a significant toll on the value of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I'll make another offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, hoping to find common ground before the value of the money drops further."
