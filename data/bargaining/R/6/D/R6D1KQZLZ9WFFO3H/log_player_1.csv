"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. This is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it as a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split, Alice. This is a good middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's actually $4,750.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I think it's a fair middle ground, as Bob said. I'll accept this offer to move on to the next round.
