"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A more balanced start 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll need to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 80% of the remaining amount, especially with the value of the money decreasing over time. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a fair share. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller amount than before, but still a significant portion of the remaining money. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not that big 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll need to be even more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite close to the original amount, and I don't want to risk losing more value.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm taking the offer, hoping that it's a fair compromise given the circumstances."
