"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting 80 dollars and Bob getting 20 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 50/50. We both get something, and we can finish the game. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain would be 80 * 0.8 = 64 dollars, but that's not relevant to this round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm looking for a better deal, and 50/50 is still not enough for me. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 51.2 dollars (since it's 20% less than the previous round).

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Accept and we can move forward!""
}
```"
