"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm not giving away too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a decent amount, but not too generous. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to Round 2."
