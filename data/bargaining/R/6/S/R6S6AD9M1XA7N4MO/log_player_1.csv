"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. Since my money is worth 20% less, I'm really only getting $4,000, which is a significant decrease from the initial $5,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 20% inflation, I'll adjust my proposal to account for the decreased value of my potential gain. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, giving me $4,200 and Bob $5,800. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm really only getting $2,100 in value.

However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I'm not sure I can do better. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will hold up his end of the bargain.
