"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $250,000 is now worth $225,000.

I'm not sure I'm willing to accept this offer. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $250,000 is worth $225,000, and Bob's gain of $750,000 is still worth $750,000. I'll try to take a slightly larger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Initial $1,000,000 is worth 0.7 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.47058 (or 47.058%) of the original value.

My gain of $200,000 is worth $200,000 * 0.47058 = $94,116.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.
