"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but it's still fair considering Bob's money will be worth less in the next round.  I'm hoping he'll accept this and we can avoid the potential for further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is much more equitable than my first one, I'm still going to reject it.  The inflation factor makes this a risky proposition.  I think I can do better if I get to make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This offer gives Bob a larger share of the money than my previous proposal, acknowledging that inflation is working against him more strongly than me. I'm aiming for a balance between fairness and maximizing my own gains, as the next round's inflation will significantly impact the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would ideally prefer a larger share, the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains makes this offer reasonable.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial amount of money, while further rounds could lead to further losses due to inflation."
