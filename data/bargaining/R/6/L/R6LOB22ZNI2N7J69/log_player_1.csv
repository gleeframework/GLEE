"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need for negotiations""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can start with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a bit more, I'll take the lead for now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to be careful with my decisions. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

After calculating the effective value of the money, I'll get $4,000, which is worth $3,200 in the original value (since it's 20% less than $4,000). Not a bad deal, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob the lead.

I'll reject the offer for now and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher value for myself to compensate for the loss in purchasing power.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You're taking the lead, but I'll take a bit more this round to catch up""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not ready to give up the lead yet 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the offer, I'll calculate the effective value of the money. If I accept this offer, I'll get $3,500, which is worth approximately $1,800 in the original value (since it's 48.8% less than $3,500).

It's a tough decision, but I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting now!

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the further reduction in the money's value. I'll aim for a higher value for myself to compensate for the loss in purchasing power.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up, let's find a compromise""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not backing down yet 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the offer, I'll calculate the effective value of the money. If I accept this offer, I'll get $3,000, which is worth approximately $1,000 in the original value (since it's 67.23% less than $3,000).

It's a very low offer, and I'm not sure if I can afford to accept it. However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing everything. I'll accept the offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the next round.
