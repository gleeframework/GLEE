Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need to get a bit more than 40. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the end. I'm willing to go up to 60, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate. While her offers are slowly getting better for me, I believe I can squeeze out a better deal.  The inflation is working in my favor, making her offers less appealing to her over time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""This is a great deal for you considering the inflation, Alice. Don't miss out!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to go higher, but this is my final offer. If we don't agree, we both get nothing. Let's be reasonable here. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, as it's her ""final offer."" However, she's bluffing. There are still several rounds left, and getting $0 is a terrible outcome for her.  I need to hold my ground a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's settle this.  This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** We're getting close to the end, and Alice needs to understand I'm serious.
* **Credible threat:** By stating this is my final offer, I increase the pressure on Alice to accept a less-than-ideal deal. 
* **Inflation factor:**  Every round that passes makes the deal worse for Alice due to the inflation impacting her potential gains.  

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my gains and ensuring Alice takes the deal rather than risking a zero-sum outcome."
