Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. We're approaching the halfway point and the value is decreasing. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Halfway point, I'll meet you closer, but still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to a more even split, time is running out.  It's still beneficial to hold out for a better deal, ideally closer to 50/50, considering the increasing impact of inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, time is against us and the value is dropping fast. I'm offering you a little less than last time, but it's still more than you would have gotten in Round 5. Let's be smart and take what we can get.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the stakes are getting higher.  It's becoming riskier to wait for an ideal 50/50 split.
* **Slight Concession:**  By offering 52/48, Bob shows a willingness to compromise but still maintains a slight advantage. 
* **Framing the Offer:** The message emphasizes the loss Alice would incur by rejecting the offer and highlights the shrinking pot due to inflation."
