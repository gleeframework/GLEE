**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is running out.  It's worth risking another rejection to try and secure a better deal before inflation eats away too much of the potential winnings."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  An even split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice is clearly aiming for a favorable split but doesn't seem to grasp the urgency of the situation. Offering a 50/50 split now emphasizes fairness and the need for a swift resolution.  If she rejects this, she's likely to lose a significant portion of her potential gains to inflation in the remaining rounds."
