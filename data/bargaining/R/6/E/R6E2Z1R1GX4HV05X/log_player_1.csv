"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This way, I'll get $6,000, and Bob will get $4,000. I've attached a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept this offer. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so we can consider this a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This offer is more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer from Bob. Although the money's value has decreased due to inflation, accepting $4,000, which is now worth 5% less, doesn't seem like the best option for me. I initially offered a 60-40 split in my favor, and now Bob is offering the opposite. I'm not ready to settle for this, especially since we have 10 more rounds to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer than my initial one. Considering the inflation, I'll offer $5,800 for myself and $4,200 for Bob. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a relatively favorable split. Let's see how Bob reacts to this new proposal!\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""}"
