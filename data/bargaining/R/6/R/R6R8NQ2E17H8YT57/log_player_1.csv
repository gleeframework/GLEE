Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with the 20/80 split, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob such a huge majority of the money. I think I can do better than this, and I'm willing to take the risk of going to the next round to try to get a more balanced split."
