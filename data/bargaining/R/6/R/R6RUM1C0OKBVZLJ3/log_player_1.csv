Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and leaving Bob with 40 dollars. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
