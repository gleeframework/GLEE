"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  This gives me a significant share, but leaves a fair amount for Bob.  I'm hoping this is a good starting point for a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a more balanced split this time, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000. Since we both rejected the previous offers, I believe this shows good faith and a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While this offer is significantly less than what I initially proposed, it's still a decent amount of money after the inflation.  It's better than the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers and the inflation continues to eat away at the value."
