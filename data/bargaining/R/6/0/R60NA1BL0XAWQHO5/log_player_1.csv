"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money 60/40 in favor of Bob. I believe this is a fair division, considering we both take on equal risk. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
