"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

In this round, the money I gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the effective gain for me is 40 * 0.9 = 36.

I'll accept this offer.
