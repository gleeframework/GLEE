"Round 1

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous yet! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. The offer from Bob is 400,000 for me, which is 40% of the original 1,000,000. This is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.
