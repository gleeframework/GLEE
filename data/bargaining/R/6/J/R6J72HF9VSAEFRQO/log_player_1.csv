Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  It's unlikely Bob will accept it, but it allows me to get the ball rolling and get a feel for how he's thinking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair deal, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future. It's worth accepting now before inflation significantly affects my potential gains."
