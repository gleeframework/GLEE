"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the risk of losing more in the next rounds""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's start with equal shares 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than 50/50. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and considering Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get the majority""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting more aggressive, I'll try to balance it out 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to be cautious. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate. However, I also don't want to give away too much.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 40%. I'll wait for his next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up control yet""
}

# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll try to take advantage of it 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly, and Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation!

Considering the current state of the money, I'll have to be careful not to give away too much. However, I also don't want to risk going into the next round with a lower percentage. Since the money I gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less, I'll have to make a decision.
