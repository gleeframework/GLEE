"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the inflation that will eat away at the money's value!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth 20% less now due to inflation. I'll make a new offer, trying to account for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
