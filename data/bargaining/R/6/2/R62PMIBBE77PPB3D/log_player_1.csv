"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and see if Bob is willing to accept a tiny share.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm disappointed I didn't get more in the first round, I realize that refusing this offer would mean I'd get even less in the next round due to inflation. It's better to take what I can get now!"
