"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose that I get $9000, and Bob gets $1000. I'm starting with a generous offer to see if he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it is an even split, I am still losing a lot of value due to the inflation, and I believe I can get a better deal if I propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I propose that I receive $7000, and Bob receives $3000.  This is still a significant amount for him, and I'm hoping he'll accept it before the inflation continues to eat away at our earnings."
