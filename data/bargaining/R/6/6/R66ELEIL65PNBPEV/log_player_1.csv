"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money I gain, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiation. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is biting, and I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

I'm trying to get a larger share of the money before the value of my gain continues to decrease."
