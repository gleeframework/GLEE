Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  It's a pretty generous offer given that I don't know much about Bob's preferences.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more, the inflation is starting to bite. Taking 500,000 now is better than risking getting less in the future."
