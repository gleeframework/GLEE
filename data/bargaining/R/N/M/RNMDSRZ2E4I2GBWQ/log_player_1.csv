"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. This is a generous offer, considering I'm giving up a significant amount to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 70-30 is a better split 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is affecting me harder than Bob, I see!

Considering the new values, I'd rather not accept this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation has hit me harder, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 55-45 is still a bit too generous for me 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the new values, I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I think I have to consider it. The 55-45 split I proposed earlier is now worth less to me due to inflation, so I'm not as attached to it. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too close to the 60-40 split I initially proposed, which I thought was too generous.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can get a better deal in the next round.
