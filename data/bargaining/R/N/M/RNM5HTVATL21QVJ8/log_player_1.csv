I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me a large share of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate.  It's important to remember the inflation factor - each round will make the money worth less for both of us, but especially for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than my previous one, but I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I know the money is worth less with each passing round, but I'm willing to take the risk."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a more even split than his last offer,  but still keeping a larger share for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept this time, as the money will be worth less for both of us in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round. While it's not ideal, a 450,000$ gain is still substantial."
