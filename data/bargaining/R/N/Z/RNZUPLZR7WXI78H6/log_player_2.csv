"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  We can work something out if you want to keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept a 90/10 split right off the bat.  Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd love to get more, I'm not sure how much better I can do. Accepting this offer at least guarantees me a decent chunk of the money."
