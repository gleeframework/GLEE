"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a reasonable division""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think splitting the money evenly is a good idea, since I'm the one who made the first offer and Bob rejected it. I'd like to make a new offer that takes into account the fact that I made the initial proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share since I made the first offer""}

I'm proposing that I get 70 dollars and Bob gets 30 dollars. I'm trying to find a middle ground that still gives me a slightly larger share, since I made the initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a slightly more even split.  How about this? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise. The 55-45 split is closer to an even split than my previous offer, and it's a reasonable adjustment from my initial proposal. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
