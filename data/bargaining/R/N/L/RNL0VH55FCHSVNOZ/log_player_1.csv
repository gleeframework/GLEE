"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since the money is worth less with each passing round, especially for Bob, it's in both our interests to come to an agreement quickly. By offering Bob a significant portion, I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting early to minimize his losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable, this offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nMy reasoning is that, despite the inflation, Bob's offer doesn't seem reasonable enough for me to accept. The difference in the amounts we gain is still quite significant, and given that the money is worth less now, I believe I can propose a better division in the next round that benefits me more, or at least comes closer to my initial offer, considering the devaluation for both of us will continue."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 540000, ""bob_gain"": 460000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\nMy reasoning is that, given the decreased value of money for both of us, especially the larger decrease for Bob, I'm adjusting my offer to slightly favor myself more than the initial offer but still give Bob a significant portion. The message aims to convey that I'm willing to negotiate towards a middle ground, considering the impact of inflation on our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's close this out before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nMy reasoning is that, at this point, the money has significantly decreased in value for both of us, but especially for Bob. Given that his offer is not far from my last proposal and considering his message that this is his final offer, I believe it's in my best interest to accept. The difference in our gains is relatively small, and continuing the game would only lead to further devaluation, likely resulting in less real value for me even if I managed to get a slightly better split in future rounds. Accepting now seems to be the most pragmatic choice to maximize my gain."
