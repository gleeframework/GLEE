"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, with a message suggesting a 4:1 split, which is a relatively generous offer considering the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to make it more interesting 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 gain in the first round is now worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's still not favorable to me, and I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my previous $8,000 gain is now worth even less. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away with a 3:1 split that easily!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, with a message to try to put some pressure on him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight compromise to get closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With a 27.1% decrease, my previous $7,000 gain is now worth significantly less.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a slight compromise, the value of the money is decreasing so rapidly that I'm not sure it's worth accepting a deal that's still not extremely favorable to me. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing rapidly, I need to be more aggressive in my offer. I'll try to take a bigger share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to get a good deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,500 and keeping $7,500 for myself, with a message to put pressure on him to accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to be even more aggressive in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and make a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With a 40.95% decrease, my previous $7,500 gain is now worth significantly less.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully. A 50:50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a fair split, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing rapidly, I'll try to take an even bigger share. I'll make a more aggressive offer, but I'll still leave some room for Bob to accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to get a good deal, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, with a message to put even more pressure on him to accept. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to be extremely aggressive in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really accelerating! With a 52.17% decrease, my previous $8,000 gain is now worth a fraction of its original value.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully. Although it's not a great deal, it's still a 60:40 split, which is better than the 50:50 split he offered earlier.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, given the rapid decrease in the money's value, I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come. This deal is still better than nothing, and I'll take it."
