This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a slightly larger share, but I think it's a fair starting point.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is simply a reversal of my initial offer. I'm not going to accept that just because he was the one who rejected my proposal. It seems like we both want a bigger piece of the pie, and it's time to see if we can find some common ground.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give in to his demands just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even split this time.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I think a 50/50 split is the most reasonable way to avoid both of us losing too much. Let's see if Bob is ready to compromise."
