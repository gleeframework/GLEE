Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very greedy opening move, aiming to maximize my gains. While Bob will only get $1, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer knowing that if he rejects it, he'll face a 10% reduction in his share with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome.  Considering Bob's offer is a 10% reduction in value for him, it's likely he won't make a better offer in the future rounds."
