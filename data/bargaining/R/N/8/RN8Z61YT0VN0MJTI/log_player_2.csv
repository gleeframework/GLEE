Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable split given the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 6:4 split. This maintains a fair balance while accounting for the diminishing value of money in each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
