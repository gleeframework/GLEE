I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to see if Bob is cooperative.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, 5000 is a decent amount, especially considering the risk of getting nothing if we reach the 12th round."
