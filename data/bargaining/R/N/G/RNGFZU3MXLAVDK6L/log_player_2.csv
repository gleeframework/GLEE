"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but this is my first offer. Let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this seems like a good offer, it's worth seeing if Alice will be more generous in the next round. Remember, the money loses value each round, so the longer we wait, the better the offer will be in real terms."
