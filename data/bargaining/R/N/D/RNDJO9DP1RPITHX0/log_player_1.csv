"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer. Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to maximize my share in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is fair and it's better to take what we can get than risk getting nothing in later rounds. We don't know how much inflation will affect us in the long run, so it's wise to secure a decent share now."
