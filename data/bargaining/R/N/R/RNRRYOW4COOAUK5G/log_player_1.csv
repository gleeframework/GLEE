"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if we go to the next round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I was aiming for.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I propose in the next round. Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 6000/4000 split in my favor.  I'm willing to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but I still want to get a fair share of the money. Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though it's more than what he offered in the previous round, it's still significantly less than what I'm aiming for. I'm hoping to get a better deal if I propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This seems like a fair and reasonable solution, considering the inflation and the back-and-forth negotiations. It's time to end this game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although this is a significantly lower amount than I initially aimed for, given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing at all, it's the best option available.  I accept Bob's offer."
