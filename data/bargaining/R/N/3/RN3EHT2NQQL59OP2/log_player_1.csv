Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

This is a tough one! Here's why I made the decision to accept:

* **Inflation:** The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for me. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The difference between Bob's offer in this round and my offer in the previous round is minimal after accounting for inflation. It's unlikely I can get him much lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds is incredibly risky given the rapid inflation working against me. 

While not ideal, taking $180,000 is better than risking a much lower amount if the game continues."
