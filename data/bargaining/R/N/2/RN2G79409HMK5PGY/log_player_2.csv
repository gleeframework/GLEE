**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure me by using my disadvantage against me. While the deal is getting worse with each round, I'm banking on Alice wanting to settle *before* it gets to the point where I have to accept a terrible deal out of desperation.  I'll hold out a little longer and see if she gets nervous."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but I'm also drawing a line in the sand. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to push Alice to make a decision and avoid letting the negotiation drag on further to my detriment."
