"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I take most of the money now, but you'll get a bigger share if we keep playing. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds somewhat 'fair' on the surface, she's heavily weighting the present value in her favor.  It's highly likely I can get a much better deal in a later round, even with the impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""This offer accounts for future inflation and offers a more equitable split. Let's settle this now.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Timing is Key:**  Alice's impatience plays to my advantage. With each round, the money loses value for her at double the rate it does for me.
* **Strong Opening:**  A 65/35 split in my favor is a strong opening position. It's likely significantly better than anything I'd get in later rounds.
* **Call to Action:** By framing the offer as ""equitable"" and emphasizing a quick resolution, I'm hoping to appeal to Alice's desire for a larger sum now rather than risking a much smaller amount later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer is fair given the inflation we're experiencing, and avoids any further risk of losing money. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Shift:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation. Her offer has shifted significantly in my favor from her initial 90/10 proposal.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I was aiming for 650,000, accepting 550,000 now is far better than risking another round where both of our potential gains shrink further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds isn't worth the potential loss if Alice becomes even more risk-averse and offers a much lower amount."
