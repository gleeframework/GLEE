"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and start with a clean slate. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can start fresh."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less after the first round, Bob's offer is a bit more attractive to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 20% of my potential gain just yet. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up more than 30. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to protect my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but I'm willing to give you a small portion too. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth even less after the third round, Bob's offer is getting more attractive to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk losing out on any potential gain."
