"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 600,000$ is actually worth 600,000 * 0.95 = 570,000$ in real value, and Bob's gain of 400,000$ is worth 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000$ in real value.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll have to consider it. I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to get as much value as possible. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than mine, I'll offer him a smaller share to compensate for the inflation difference.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me this time, but still a fair deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of the offer:

My gain of 580,000$ is worth 580,000 * 0.855 (1 - 0.145) = 494,100$ in real value.
Bob's gain of 420,000$ is worth 420,000 * 0.729 (1 - 0.271) = 306,180$ in real value.

This offer seems better than my previous one, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept the offer.
