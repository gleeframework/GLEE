"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 4:1 is a good start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% and Bob getting 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is now worth 5% less, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value.

Bob's offer is a 50:50 split, which is reasonable. I'll accept this offer.
