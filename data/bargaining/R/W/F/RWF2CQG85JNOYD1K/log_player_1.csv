Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to split evenly Alice, but this is my only chance to make an offer. I'm offering you a larger share than you'd get if we continue and the money loses value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
