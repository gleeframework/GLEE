600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, inflation is hitting us both hard. I'm willing to compromise, but 80/20 is still too uneven. Let's split it 60/40, a fairer split in this situation.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, we're both losing more and more with each round.  It's clear neither of us is going to get what we originally wanted. Let's cut our losses and split the money 50/50.  It's the only way we both get something out of this.",Alice,5,
