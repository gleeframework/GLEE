"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a relatively high offer for myself, aiming for 90% of the money. This is a gamble, but it sets a strong initial baseline and potentially encourages Bob to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a significant shift in the power dynamic, and Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation factor. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to lower my proposed share to 60%  in this round, acknowledging the inflation pressure.  I'm aiming for a compromise that is still favorable for me, but offers Bob a better deal than his previous proposal.  This should encourage him to consider accepting rather than risking further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is pushing his luck with this offer. The inflation is taking its toll, but I'm still not willing to accept such a drastically unequal split. I'm going to reject this and continue to try and negotiate a fairer deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55} 
```

I'm going to continue lowering my proposed share, but I'm still aiming for a split that gives me at least 45% of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will start to realize that pushing too hard could lead to both of us getting nothing, especially with the increasingly significant inflation."
