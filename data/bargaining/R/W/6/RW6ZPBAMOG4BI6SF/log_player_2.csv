Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worth it for me after the inflation.  Let's split it 60/40 this time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Analyze the impact of inflation on Alice's gain
Inflation causes Alice's gain to be worth 20% less with each passing round. By round 4, her gain is worth significantly less than the initial value.

### Step 2: Consider the previous offers and their implications
Alice initially offered a 90/10 split, which was rejected. Then, a 60/40 split was proposed by both parties but rejected. Given the inflation, Alice might be more inclined to accept a less favorable split to minimize further loss.

### Step 3: Determine a strategic offer that accounts for inflation and previous negotiations
Considering the previous offers and the impact of inflation, a strategic offer would be to propose a split that slightly improves upon the last offer made to Alice but still favors Bob, as the money's value remains constant for him.

### Step 4: Calculate the proposed split
Given the last offer was a 60/40 split, and considering the need to make a more favorable offer to Alice due to inflation, a 55/45 split could be a strategic move. However, since Alice's gain is worth less due to inflation, maintaining a stronger position might be advantageous.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer and message to Alice
Propose a split that reflects the strategic considerations and include a message that emphasizes the fairness and finality of the offer.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to offer a 55/45 split. This is a fair offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.""}"
