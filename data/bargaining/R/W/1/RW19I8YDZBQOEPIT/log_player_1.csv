"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same and Bob's gain being worth 5% less, this offer is not as favorable to me as the initial 50-50 split. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the previous offers and the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of Bob's gain. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves a significant amount for Bob, taking into account the decreasing value of his gain due to inflation. Your turn!"
