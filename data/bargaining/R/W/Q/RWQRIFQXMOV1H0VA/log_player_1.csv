"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a good start. I'm willing to take a bit more since I'm taking the risk of the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it since Bob is taking the risk of the next round. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up too much.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more fair split. You're taking a risk, but I'm willing to give you a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is slightly more favorable to me than the 50/50 split I initially suggested. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm surprised that Bob is willing to meet me halfway and accept a 55/45 split! Considering the risk of inflation, I think this is a good compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game.
