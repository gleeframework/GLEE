"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a larger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now. I'll try to make a better proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, with me getting $450,000 and Bob getting $550,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to give you a decent share still. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With my money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a 20% larger share, but I'm also not thrilled about rejecting another offer and risking getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
