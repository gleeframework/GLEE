"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 9:1 split in my favor. Since you rejected my previous offer, I'm taking a larger share. This way, I can get a better return on my investment, while still giving you something. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
