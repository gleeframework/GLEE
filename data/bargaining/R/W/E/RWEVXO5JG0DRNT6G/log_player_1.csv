"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""let's be fair""}\n\nI am offering 60 dollars to myself and 40 dollars to Bob. I have also attached a message saying ""let's be fair"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer.\n\nPlease let me know what Bob decides to do next.\n\n###\n\n(I'll wait for your response)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a slightly better split. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 20% less, Bob's offer of 45 dollars for me is actually equivalent to 36 dollars in the original value (45 / 1.2).\n\nConsidering this, I think I can get a better deal if I reject the offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease let Bob know that I rejected his offer and I will make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still trying to maximize my gain.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""50/50 is the fairest split, don't let inflation win""}\n\nI'm offering an equal split of 50 dollars each, and I've attached a message emphasizing the fairness of this proposal and the importance of reaching an agreement before inflation further reduces the value of the money.\n\nLet me know what Bob decides to do next.\n\n###\n\n(I'll wait for your response)"
