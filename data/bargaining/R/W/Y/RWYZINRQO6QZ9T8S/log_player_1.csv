"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair start. If Bob accepts, we can end the game and avoid the inflation that will come with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, the money is worth less than before, and I need to make the most of it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger toll, I need to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving up enough, Bob. I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm taking a firmer stance and offering Bob $40, hoping to get a better deal in return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much. You're getting closer, but not close enough yet. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger toll on me, but I'm not giving up yet. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I need to be more aggressive in my demands. However, Bob's offer is still not good enough.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better deal. I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, but I'm not ready to settle for this yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's getting close to the deadline, Bob. Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's the fairest way to end this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in ending the game now and avoiding further inflation."
