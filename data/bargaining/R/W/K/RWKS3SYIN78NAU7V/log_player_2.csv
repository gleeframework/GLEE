"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can meet in the middle, but considering the inflation, I'll take a bit more. 55/45 seems reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the inflation and decided to make an offer that is slightly in my favor, but still relatively fair. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer before the money loses more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. I propose a 50/50 split.  It's fair and avoids further losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Alice's offer is now a 50/50 split, I think it's a fair deal. The longer we go on, the less the money is worth, so I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further losses."
