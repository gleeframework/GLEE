"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000. Consider the inflation and let's finish this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next.  I'll try to get a better deal.  Inflation is a factor, but I want to maximize my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a little more, Alice, but I think it's time we both start thinking about inflation. This is a lot of money we could lose if we keep playing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right about the inflation, Bob. I'm proposing a slightly better split for me this time: $5,500 to me, $4,500 to you. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I think it's wise to accept this offer.  The inflation is starting to really bite, and I don't want to risk losing even more by continuing to play.  Let's get this over with!"
