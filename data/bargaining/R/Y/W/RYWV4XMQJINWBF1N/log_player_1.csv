"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000 and take $6000. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will want to negotiate and give me a better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting! My $6000 is now worth less.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. I'm not thrilled about giving him the majority, but I need to weigh the options.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to protect my share. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my desire for a larger share with the need to be realistic about the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a tiny bit to make it interesting 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my share! My $6000 is now worth less than $5000, and my proposed share of $5500 is now worth even less.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him the majority, and the $1000 I'd get is a tiny consolation prize. I think I can do better than that.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you the majority anymore. Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it.""
}
```

I'm taking a firmer stance, and I think a 50/50 split is a fair compromise."
