"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm sure you understand that I deserve the larger share.  Let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The current offer is not acceptable, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, we both deserve a decent share. Inflation is coming!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making an offer that gives me 45% of the total amount and Alice 55%. I'm trying to be reasonable and take into account that Alice initially offered me 10%, which was too low. With inflation looming, I want to conclude the deal quickly while still getting a fair share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve a larger share.  Let's end this before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice has increased her offer from 10% to 40%, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Considering inflation, I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'll try to convince Alice to accept a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making an offer that gives me 42% of the total amount and Alice 58%. Given the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. I'm hoping Alice will see the sense in concluding the deal quickly, as further delays will only reduce the value of our gains."
