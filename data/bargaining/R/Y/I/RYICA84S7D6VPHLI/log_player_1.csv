"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very risky move, but it maximizes my potential gain in the first round.  It's highly unlikely Bob will accept, but if he does, I get the vast majority of the money. If not, I'll have to strategize more in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy. While 100,000 is a lot of money, it's still a tiny fraction of the initial pot.  I'll risk it and see if I can get a better deal in the following rounds. I still have plenty of time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer. If Bob rejects it, he knows he's risking a substantial amount of money, and I'm confident he'll see the logic in accepting."
