"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know you value this money, so I'm offering you a generous 40%. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation rate is higher for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing for both of us. I'm offering you 45 which is more than it will be worth next round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll take the 45% offer from Alice. With the inflation rate increasing, it's likely that the value of the money will continue to decrease, and this offer might be the best I can get."
