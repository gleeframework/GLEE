"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is now worth 5% less than in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value.

The offer is 30/70, which is 30/70 * 100/0.95 = 31.58 in terms of the original value.

I accept this offer.
