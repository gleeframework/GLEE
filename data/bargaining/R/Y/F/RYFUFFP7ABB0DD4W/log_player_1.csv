"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and take $6000 for myself, with a message ""Let's be fair"". Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so we're still dealing with the full $10,000. I'm trying to start with a relatively even split, slightly in my favor, but still leaving room for negotiation. The message ""Let's be fair"" aims to set a tone of reasonableness and cooperation, hoping to influence Bob's decision positively. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this game! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation that affects only my share, accepting this offer would mean I actually get less value than Bob. My share of $5000 is now worth 20% less due to inflation, making it effectively $4000 in value from the original round's perspective, while Bob's share remains at the full $5000 value for him. Given this, I'm inclined to reject and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal that compensates for the loss in value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}\n\nGiven that we're now in the third round and my share is worth 20% less due to inflation (and this effect compounds), I'll adjust my offer to try and compensate for this loss in value. By proposing that I take $5800 and Bob takes $4200, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that considers the devaluation of my share over the rounds. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split"" aims to explain my reasoning to Bob, emphasizing the need for an adjustment due to the inflationary effect on my share. Hopefully, this rationale will resonate with Bob and lead to a more acceptable agreement."
