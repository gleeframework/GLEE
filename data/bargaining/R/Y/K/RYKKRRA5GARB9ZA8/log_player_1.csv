"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  Let's see if he's happy with that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. Even though it's less than my first proposal, it's still a decent split, and I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going without getting nothing."
