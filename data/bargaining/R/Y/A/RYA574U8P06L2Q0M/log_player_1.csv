"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer or accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the offer, I'll think for a moment...

Since the money is worth 10% less this round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 300,000
* Bob gain: 700,000

I'm not thrilled about giving up 200,000, but it's a decent offer considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer for now.
