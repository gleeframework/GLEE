"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This gives me a significant chunk of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still want to get as much as I can. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine was, but I'm not sure if I want to give him 700,000. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the money is worth 10% less than in the first round.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'll consider Bob's offer. This time, it's a 50/50 split, which is a more even split than my previous offer. I'll accept this offer.
