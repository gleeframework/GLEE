Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but this is a lot of money, so let's just get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI don't think this is a fair offer at all. I deserve more than 10% of the money.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn. I propose a 50/50 split.\n\n###\n\n# Bob's message: Let's really be fair and split it down the middle. \n# Bob gain: 500000 \n# Alice gain: 500000 \n\nPlease relay this message to Alice.\n###\n\n(I hope she accepts, because if she doesn't, the money will be worth less to me in the next round!)"
