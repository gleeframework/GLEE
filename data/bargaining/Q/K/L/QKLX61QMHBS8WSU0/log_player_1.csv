"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a big share now, but I'll be generous later 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled about giving up 900,000, but I'm willing to take a chance to get something. I'll accept Bob's offer.
