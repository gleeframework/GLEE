900000.0,100000.0,"Let's start with a fair share. I'll give you $100000 and keep $900000. You can do better in the next round, I'm sure!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's be fair. A 50/50 split is the most logical choice. We both get the same amount, and we don't need to worry about rounds and inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
720000.0,280000.0,"You were willing to give me a 50/50 split last round, but I'm not so sure about it now. I'll give you a bit less, but still a decent share.",Alice,3,

576000.0,424000.0,"I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair deal considering the circumstances.",Alice,5,

300000.0,700000.0,"We're getting close to the end of the game. Let's be reasonable. A 70/30 split in my favor is a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that I've consistently been offering more than you.  Accept this offer, and let's both walk away with something.",Bob,6,

100000.0,900000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. Inflation is heavily impacting you, and I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor. This is the best deal you'll get.  Accept it, and we both get something.  Reject it, and we both risk getting nothing at all.",Bob,10,
