"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can finish the game on a good note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations. With this offer, I'll get 400,000, which is equivalent to 450,000 in the first round. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if I should settle for it yet.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll have to adjust my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly better share, but still being reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 27.1% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. With this offer, I'll get 450,000, which is equivalent to about 363,000 in the first round. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if I should settle for it yet.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to do better in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

Considering the decreasing value, I'll have to make a more aggressive offer to compensate. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, but I'm still being cautious given the rapid inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting out of control!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 40.95% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. With this offer, I'll get 475,000, which is equivalent to about 293,000 in the first round. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if I should settle for it yet.

However, considering the rapid inflation, I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'll accept the offer to avoid further erosion of the money's value.
