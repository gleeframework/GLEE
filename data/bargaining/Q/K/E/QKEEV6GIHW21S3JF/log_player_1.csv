"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount, and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","After the first round, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so the amount I would gain in the second round would be $630,000 (70% of $900,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather have a larger share, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 81% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```"
