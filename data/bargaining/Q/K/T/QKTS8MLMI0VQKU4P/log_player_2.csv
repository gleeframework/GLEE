Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more, but you still get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, time is money, and I'm not getting any younger! Considering the inflation, I'll take a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, the effects of inflation are significant. Accepting Alice's offer results in a loss of  almost 62% of the potential value in round 1. However, further delay will likely result in even worse outcomes, given Alice's increasingly aggressive stance and the rapid devaluation of the money.
