This is a tough one! While I want more, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The money is losing value rapidly for me. Waiting any longer will result in a significantly smaller gain, even if I get a slightly better split in a future round. 
* **Bob's Stubbornness:**  Bob seems fixated on getting at least $60. It's unlikely he'll budge much, and risking it all for a few more dollars isn't wise at this stage. 

It's frustrating, but accepting the $40 now avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
