"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share, but you'll get a decent chunk. Accept and we both win, or risk it all with a lower offer next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm going to play this game strategically. While Alice's offer is tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  There's a lot of money at stake, and the value is decreasing each round.  I'll risk it for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice.  While your offer was generous, it wasn't fair.  This is a 60/40 split,  a fair and reasonable compromise.  Accept, and we both walk away with a healthy share.  Reject, and we risk losing a lot more.""
