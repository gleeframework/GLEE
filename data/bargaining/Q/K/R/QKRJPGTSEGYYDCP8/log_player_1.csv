"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice.  While your offer was generous, it wasn't fair.  This is a 60/40 split,  a fair and reasonable compromise.  Accept, and we both walk away with a healthy share.  Reject, and we risk losing a lot more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
