"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth $285,000 (95% of $300,000).

I'm not sure if this is the best I can do, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not risk going into the next round with a smaller share.

I accept the offer.
