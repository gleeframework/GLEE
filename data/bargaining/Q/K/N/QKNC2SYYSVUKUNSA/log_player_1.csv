"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going for a slightly unfair but not too outrageous split.  This way, I hope Bob will see the potential for a better deal in the future rounds if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000

Bob's offer is way too unfair. I'm going to reject this and hope he sees the potential for a more even split in the future rounds."

I'm proposing a more even split this time.  I believe this is a fair offer that Bob should consider."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than his last one, it's still not fair. I'm going to reject it and try for a more balanced distribution."

I'm offering a slightly better deal for Bob than my previous offer.  I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept and avoid more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

I'm proposing an equal split now.  With only a few rounds left, I think it's the best way to avoid both of us getting nothing."
