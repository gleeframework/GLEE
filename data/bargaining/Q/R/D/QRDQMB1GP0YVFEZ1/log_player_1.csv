"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split, slightly in my favor, but still a relatively fair and reasonable starting point. The message ""Let's be fair"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to consider the offer seriously. Given the impact of inflation, it's crucial to try to reach an agreement early in the game to maximize the value of the money for both of us. By starting with a slightly higher offer for myself, I also leave room for negotiation in subsequent rounds if Bob decides to reject this initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering your offer was a bit unfair. Let's start fresh! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his message suggesting it's a more fair split, it simply flips the proportions from my initial offer without considering the impact of inflation. Given that the money is worth 20% less for me now, accepting 45 would be significantly less valuable than the 55 I initially proposed for myself. Furthermore, Bob's loss due to inflation is less severe (10% less), making his proposed 55 more valuable for him than my initial offer. I believe there's room for a compromise that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us, but more so for me. I'll aim to find a middle ground in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nGiven the effects of inflation, I've reduced my initial offer to account for the decrease in value, aiming for a compromise. Meeting closer to the middle seems like a reasonable approach, considering both of our losses due to inflation. By offering 52 for myself and 48 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a balance that acknowledges the greater decrease in value I'm experiencing while still being fair to Bob. The message aims to convey my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution."
