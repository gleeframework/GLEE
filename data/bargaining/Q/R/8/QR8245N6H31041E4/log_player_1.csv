"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we both get less money with each round 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is the best split, I was thinking more like 55/45 or 52.5/47.5?""}

I'm willing to consider a slightly more skewed split in Bob's favor, but I'd like to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52/48 is a fairer split considering the decreasing value of the money.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, with me getting 52% and Bob getting 48%."
