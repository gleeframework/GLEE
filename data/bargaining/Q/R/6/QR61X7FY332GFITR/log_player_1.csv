"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm making a fair and straightforward offer, proposing a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower share, but I think this is still a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth 90% of the original amount, while Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'm willing to accept this offer since it's still a relatively fair split. I'll take the $400,000 and call it a day.
