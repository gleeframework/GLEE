"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be strategic.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. I'd rather not give Bob a bigger share than I have to.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing, I'll aim for a bigger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You took a bigger share last round, now it's my turn""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which I think is a fair response to Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly! I need to think carefully.

After considering the offers, I think I'll accept this one. 5200 is a decent share, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less valuable money.
