"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to divide the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'm being generous! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is very generous at all!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite lopsided, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""A slightly more balanced proposal, let's see if you'll accept!""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself."
