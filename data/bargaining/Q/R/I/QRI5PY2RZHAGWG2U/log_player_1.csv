"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of $4000 is now equivalent to $3800 in the original amount.

Considering Bob's compromise, I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me. I'd rather aim for a higher share, especially since the money is decreasing in value over time.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share to account for the decreasing value of money.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $200 from the previous round, hoping to get a better deal. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less, my gain of $3500 is now equivalent to $3009.29 in the original amount.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards his side. I'd like to get a higher share to compensate for the inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to adjust for the inflation, but I still think I deserve a bit more to account for the decreasing value of money.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $1000 from the previous round, hoping to get a better deal. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
