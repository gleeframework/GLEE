Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn to be generous. Let's wrap this up and not waste time with more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out, and we both lose if this drags on.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offers are still heavily skewed in his favor. The inflation is working against him, and he knows it. I'm going to call his bluff and see if he panics in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This is it, Bob. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking, and I'm not budging any further.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. This is ridiculous. We both lose if this goes any further. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally cracked.  While a 65/35 split was ideal, the 50/50 split is the best I can realistically hope for at this stage. The inflation is heavily impacting his potential gains, and he knows that every round makes walking away with nothing more likely."
