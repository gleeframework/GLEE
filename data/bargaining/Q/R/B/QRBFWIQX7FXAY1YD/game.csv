70.0,30.0,"I propose dividing the money 70/30 in favor of Alice. This might seem like a large offer, but remember, the value of money decreases with each round due to inflation.",Alice,1,

,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"You want 50/50, but I think I can do better. I'm offering you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal considering the inflation is affecting your share more than mine.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
65.0,35.0,I propose a 65/35 split in favor of Alice. This takes into account the inflation and also gives you a significant portion of the money. Let's aim for a compromise that benefits both of us.,Alice,5,

10.0,90.0,"You're pushing for a bigger share, but I'm not budging. I think I can do better than 35. I'm offering you a smaller share, but it's still a better deal than what you're offering me.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
55.0,45.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose a 55/45 split in favor of Alice. This offers a reasonable compromise while taking into account the diminishing value of money with each round.",Alice,7,
