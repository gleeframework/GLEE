"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. A 50/50 split ensures we both maximize our gains and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at the money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Bob's offer is slightly less than what I proposed, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking further inflation.  We're already losing money due to the 5% decrease, so dragging it out is not in my best interest."
