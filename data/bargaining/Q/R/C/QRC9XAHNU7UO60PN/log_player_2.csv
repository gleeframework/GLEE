"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact on your gain, this is a reasonable adjustment 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting me more each round, let's be fair and split it evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation on your gain, I'm adjusting the split accordingly 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my diminishing returns due to inflation. While her offer is incrementally better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to signal I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to avoid further losses from inflation, but this needs to be reasonable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing impact of inflation, my share needs to reflect the real value difference 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is severely eating into my potential gains. Accepting $42 now is significantly better than risking getting a slightly better deal in later rounds only to have inflation erode the value.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has consistently rejected my offers and seems content to slowly increase her share while the value of my potential gains diminishes.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is becoming very real.

It's frustrating to accept a deal where Alice gets significantly more, but the alternative is likely worse at this stage."
