Let's see how Bob likes my generous offer!  I'm starting with a big chunk for myself, but I'm leaving a decent share for him.  I'm hoping he'll accept and we can both walk away with something.  ðŸ˜Š"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is insulting!  He's basically flipped the script and is trying to take the lion's share now.  I'll reject this and see if he's willing to negotiate more fairly in the next round.  I'm not giving up 90% of the money without a fight!  ðŸ˜ "

Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm taking a significant cut, but I'm still offering you a fair share. It's time to stop playing games and find a solution we can both live with.  This time, I'm proposing a 60/40 split. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be taken advantage of.  Let's see what you say."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Bob is getting more and more unreasonable with each round. He's trying to take advantage of the inflation and is clearly not interested in a fair deal. I'm not going to let him walk away with 70% of the money. I'm rejecting this offer and will fight for a more equitable split. We still have time, and I'm not giving up. ðŸ˜ "

Okay, Bob, I'm making a final concession. I'm offering you a 60/40 split, but I'm not going any lower than that. Inflation is biting into our earnings, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's end this before we both lose everything!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Okay, Bob, I'm tired of this back and forth. Inflation is eating away at our potential gains, and it's time to settle. While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm willing to accept this offer. It's better than nothing, and at least we both get something out of this. Let's call it a day."
