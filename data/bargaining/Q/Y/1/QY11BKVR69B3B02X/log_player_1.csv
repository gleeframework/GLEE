"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large share (90%) while still giving Bob a small amount.  Since I'm going first, I'm trying to maximize my gains while still ensuring Bob has a reason to accept rather than rejecting and taking the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer gives me less than my initial proposal, accepting it guarantees me a gain, albeit a smaller one. Rejecting it risks losing everything due to the inflation, and there's no guarantee that I will be able to get a better deal in the future."
