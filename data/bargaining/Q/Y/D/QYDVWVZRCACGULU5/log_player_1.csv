Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 5500/4500 split in my favor. This feels like a fair starting point, acknowledging that I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy! I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Since Bob rejected my last offer, I'm willing to compromise and propose an even 50/50 split. This seems fair, given the inflation, and it should be attractive enough for Bob to accept.  Let's see if he's reasonable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob is still trying to get more, this offer is better than the last one. Since we're already facing a significant loss due to inflation, I'm willing to accept a 4500/5500 split."
