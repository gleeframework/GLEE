"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a larger share, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is equivalent to 480,000 in the first round, which is still a bit more than my initial offer. However, I'm not convinced that I should give up a larger share.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer that's slightly more aggressive than my initial 50/50 split. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'll aim to take a slightly larger share.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up more than 10% of the total.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 480k, but I think I deserve more, considering the value of the money is decreasing 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take a closer look at Bob's offer for Round 4. Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, Bob's offer is equivalent to 384,000 in the first round, which is a bit more than my initial 50/50 split. However, I'm not sure if I should give up a larger share, especially since Bob is trying to take a slightly larger share.

I'll think about it for a moment...

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering that Bob is trying to take a larger share. Since the money is decreasing in value, I'll aim to take an even larger share to compensate for the loss.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, but I'm still willing to compromise. Meet me in the middle, or I'll keep pushing for more.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 520k, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the value of the money is decreasing 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 6, Bob's offer is equivalent to 170,400 in the first round, considering the inflation. This is a relatively small amount, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting, especially since I was hoping to take a larger share.

However, I'm getting closer to the deadline, and I don't want to risk losing everything. I'll think about it for a moment...
