"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate from there!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split, and then we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think splitting it evenly is fair, considering the initial proposal I made and the fact that Bob is now getting a better deal due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll propose:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial proposal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $44, which is a slight reduction from my previous offer, and I'm keeping $56 for myself. My message to Bob is to explain my reasoning behind the compromise."
