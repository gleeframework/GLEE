"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too hard""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair offer, but I'm willing to take a bit more. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 3000 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is 2850. Bob's gain of 7000 is worth 80% of the original amount, which is 5600.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'd rather have more than 2850. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to 4200, which is worth 98% of my original target of 4300, considering the inflation."

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'd rather have more than 4000. I'll reject it.
