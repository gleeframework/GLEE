"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10, and I'll get $90. This is a generous offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's time to be fair! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I don't think this offer is fair, considering I was willing to give Bob $10 in the first round. Now he's asking for $80? That's a big jump!

I'll reject this offer and make a new one in the next round.
