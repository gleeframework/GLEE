"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a bad deal for me. Even with inflation, I'm better off rejecting and making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}
``` 

I'll lower my share slightly to account for inflation, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still better off rejecting this offer, as the inflation is hitting me hard. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43}
```

I'm going to propose a more balanced split this time, since the inflation is making it harder for me to get a larger share. I still think this is a fair offer considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still determined to get a better deal than this.  I'm willing to keep fighting even though the inflation is heavily impacting me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

With the inflation getting out of hand, I'm aiming for a more balanced split again. This offer still favors Bob, but I think it's the best I can do to secure some money before the next round."
