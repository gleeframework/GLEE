"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can still have a chance to negotiate further if we want to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's aim for a win-win situation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my proposed gains would be 7,200 for me and 1,600 for Bob in the first round, which is no longer the case.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a bit more favorable to him, but still a reasonable proposal. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'd like to make my own proposal for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risks and efforts. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept this more favorable offer."
