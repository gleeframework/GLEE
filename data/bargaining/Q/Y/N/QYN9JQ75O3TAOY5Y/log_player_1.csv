Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me taking 900,000 and Bob getting 100,000.  Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, with the inflation factor and the fact that I'm unsure how Bob's money is affected, accepting a 50/50 split is a good deal. It's better than getting nothing!"
