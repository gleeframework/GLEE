"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a significant portion of the money, but not so much that Bob will reject it outright.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the reduced value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Since the money is worth less, I'll take a bit more to compensate.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
