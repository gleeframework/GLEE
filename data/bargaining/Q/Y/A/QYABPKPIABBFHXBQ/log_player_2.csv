Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to concede a little more, but I need to ensure a decent share for myself as well. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, which is working to our advantage. While her offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still  beneficial for me to hold out a little longer and see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,

""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a generous offer considering how much your share is shrinking.  Don't get greedy!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. We're both losing a lot due to inflation, so it's time to be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally making sense.  While I might have been able to squeeze a bit more out of her in earlier rounds, the inflation is starting to significantly impact my potential gains as well. An even split at this stage is a good deal and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.  It's better to secure a win now than risk getting nothing at all."
