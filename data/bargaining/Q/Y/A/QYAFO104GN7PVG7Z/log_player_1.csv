"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to more important things."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't get all the fun, let's start with a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing by 10% each round, my gain is now worth even less.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth accepting a relatively small share of the remaining money.

After some thought, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money value decreasing by 10% each round, I need to think strategically about my next move. Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to get a larger share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away that easily! Accept or face a tougher negotiation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, which is a more favorable ratio for me. Let's see if Bob will accept or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit greedy, Alice. Time to make a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I need to be realistic. A 30:70 split is still a relatively decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to another round with even lower value money.

After some thought, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and hope it's a fair deal."
