"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's find a middle ground. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It accounts for the inflation you'll face. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
