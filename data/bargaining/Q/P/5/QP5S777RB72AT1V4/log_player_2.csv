Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's a good deal for us to split the money now before inflation eats into the value.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's find a middle ground. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It accounts for the inflation you'll face.""}

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting worse with time! Let's be reasonable, I'll take $55, you take $45. It's better than what you'll get if you decline again. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
