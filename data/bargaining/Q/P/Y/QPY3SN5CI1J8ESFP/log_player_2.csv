"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle, fair and square. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's worth seeing what kind of offers Alice makes in the future.  With inflation, taking less than 50% could be beneficial later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split reflects the value of my time in negotiating this.  Let's get this done.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much. Let's see if this works. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, Alice's offer is still better than what I offered in the previous round, and Alice's offer is worth 36% less for her.  It's likely that if I reject, the offers will get worse for me in future rounds."
