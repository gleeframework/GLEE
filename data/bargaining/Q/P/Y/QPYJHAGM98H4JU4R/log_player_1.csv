"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 88 
# Bob gain: 12 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting less than my initial proposal, it's still a good amount, and with inflation, I'm likely to get less in the future."
