"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, let's see if you can do better than a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $4,750
* Bob gain: $4,750

I don't think this is a very good offer, considering the initial amount was $10,000. I'd like to try to get a better deal.
