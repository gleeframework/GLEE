"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Let's calculate the actual amount I'd gain in Round 2:

 Alice's gain in Round 1: 600,000
 Due to inflation, Alice's gain in Round 2 is 80% of 600,000 = 480,000

Now, let's compare Bob's offer:

 Bob's offer: 400,000

Since 480,000 (my potential gain) is more than 400,000 (Bob's offer), I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in Round 2 due to inflation. Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal.

Let's calculate the actual amount I'd gain in Round 3:

 Alice's gain in Round 2: 480,000
 Due to inflation, Alice's gain in Round 3 is 80% of 480,000 = 384,000

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob will get 45%."
