"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount, and I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll consider that when making my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""A fair split, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to maintain a decent margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's think about it...

With the money being worth 48.8% less for Bob, I'll consider that when evaluating the offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. It's a fair deal!""
}
```
