Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, accepting this offer would still give me less than the 60/40 split I proposed earlier. The inflation is working heavily in my favor, and time pressure is on Alice. I'm willing to push my luck a little further to see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. Time is running out, and the value is diminishing rapidly for you. I'm offering a 70/30 split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  I've rejected several offers, and Alice should be feeling the pressure.  This offer is heavily skewed in my favor, but the rapidly decreasing value for Alice makes it a somewhat reasonable proposition.  This might be the push needed to get Alice to accept a deal before it's too late for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last attempt at fairness 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally come down to an even 50/50 split.  While I was hoping for a better deal, the risk of walking away with nothing is too high now. It's better to accept a guaranteed win than to gamble and potentially lose everything in the remaining rounds."
