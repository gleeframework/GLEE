"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. This accounts for the inflation and gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer still stands as a fair deal.  I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I need to factor in the inflation that's working against me. This split ensures we both benefit.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is working against you, Alice, not me.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the inflation is indeed working against me, Bob is becoming too greedy.  Accepting this offer would leave me with significantly less than I could potentially gain, even with the inflation factored in.  It's time to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option considering the circumstances and ensures we both walk away with a significant amount of money.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 8 rounds left, the pressure is on.  The longer the game goes on, the less my share is worth due to inflation.
* **Strong Stance:** By proposing a 50/50 split, I demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a fair deal and not backing down.  
* **Simplicity & Appeal:** A 50/50 split is easy to understand and generally seen as fair, making it more likely Bob will accept it."
