I propose taking $9,000 for myself, and leaving $1,000 for Bob. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering Bob's money depreciates at a much faster rate than mine."

Bob's offer is still too low. While his inflation is very high, I believe I can get a better deal if we keep negotiating."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's inflation is getting out of control, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. He's only offering me 4000, which is significantly less than what I deserve considering my own inflation is far lower. I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm now offering Bob a larger share of the remaining money, recognizing the severity of his inflation. With only a few rounds left, it's crucial to find a solution that benefits both of us before the value of the money drops even further."
