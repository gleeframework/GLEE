Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, let's split the difference! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is hitting Alice much harder than Bob. While her offers might seem ""fair"" at face value, the longer the game goes on, the more desperate she'll become for a deal *any* deal. Bob can afford to hold out a bit longer and aim for a more favorable split, knowing that Alice's position weakens with each passing round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Look, let's just split it evenly and call it a day. It's the fairest deal for both of us at this point.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has the upper hand due to the differential inflation rates, it's getting risky to be too greedy. Offering an even split accomplishes the following:

* **Projects fairness:**  This might make Alice more agreeable than a continued lopsided offer.
* **Guarantees a decent sum:**  Waiting longer for a potentially better deal also risks Alice accepting nothing at all, leaving Bob with nothing. 
* **Ends the game:**  Each round brings more significant losses for both players. A clean 50/50 split brings the negotiation to a close."
