"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a fair share considering the initial 100 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, since the money is worth more to me in this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to let Bob get away with a 60/40 split in his favor. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a fair split considering the current value of the money.""
}
```

I've adjusted the split to reflect the changing value of the money and offered Bob a slightly larger share."
