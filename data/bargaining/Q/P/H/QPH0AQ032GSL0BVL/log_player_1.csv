"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she receives $55 and Bob receives $45. She attaches the message ""Let's be fair"" to her proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value decreases rapidly for you. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer, as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The fact that the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round creates a sense of urgency, but I'm not ready to accept an offer that gives Bob $70 yet. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle before it's too late for me""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that we split the money equally, with both of us receiving $50. Given the rapid decrease in value for me, I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob in the middle. I've attached a message that conveys a sense of urgency, as the value of the money will continue to decrease for me with each passing round. I'm hoping that Bob will see the fairness in this offer and accept it."
