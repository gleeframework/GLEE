"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to start by proposing a fairly uneven split, giving myself 90% and Bob 10%.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm hoping he'll accept this in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation affecting his share more significantly in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, especially considering the inflation.  I'll reject this and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit to 80% to be more reasonable, but I'm still offering Bob a significant portion. Since the inflation is affecting him more severely than me, I hope he'll consider accepting this offer to avoid the further risk of losing money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my initial offer, and the inflation is now impacting him much more heavily. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, and I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 70%, hoping to find a compromise that Bob will accept. The inflation is hitting him hard, and I need to be flexible to avoid losing out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my last offer, and the inflation is really hurting him now.  I'm not willing to accept such a small share, and I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my share again, this time to 60%. The inflation is hurting Bob significantly, and I need to be flexible to find a deal before we both lose out. This offer is still favorable to me, but I'm trying to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my last offer. The inflation is hitting him extremely hard, and I need to be more aggressive to get a better deal. I'm not going to accept such a low share, and I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm lowering my share to 55%, but I'm still hoping to get a majority of the remaining money. Bob's situation is becoming increasingly dire with inflation, and I believe this offer represents a fair compromise while still benefiting me more."
