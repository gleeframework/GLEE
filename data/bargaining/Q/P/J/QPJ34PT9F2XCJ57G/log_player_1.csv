"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and equal split! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd be getting $800,000 (80% of $1,000,000), but Bob is offering me $500,000. That's a good deal, considering the inflation!

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
