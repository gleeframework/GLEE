  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest.""

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and taking the remaining $900,000. I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the larger share this time.  I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to negotiate further, and I'd rather not give him the larger share. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give you the larger share so easily. I'll counter with 60/40, and I'll take the larger share this time.""
}

  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my guns, 60/40 is a fair split, and I'll take the larger share this time. Let's end this!""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to give Bob the larger share, but I also don't want to wait for further inflation to reduce the value of the money. I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll try to negotiate the terms.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll accept your offer, but I want to make sure we both agree that this is a one-time deal. If we agree to this, we'll both walk away with our shares and not try to negotiate further.""
