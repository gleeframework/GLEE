Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round. Waiting longer means getting even less.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, suggesting he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Potential Losses:** Rejecting this offer carries the risk of Bob offering even less in a future round, where the money will be worth even less to me.

While getting $4,000 out of the original $10,000 isn't ideal, it's better than risking a worse outcome by continuing to play."
