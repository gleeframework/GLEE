Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to do this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

After considering Bob's revised offer, I'll decide to:

{

I'm not convinced that this is a significant enough compromise from Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial proposal or even better. The pressure is mounting, and I need to make the most of it!"

Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:
