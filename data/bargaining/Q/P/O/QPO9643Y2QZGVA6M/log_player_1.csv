Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share of the money, but it's still reasonable enough to potentially entice Bob into accepting it.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my previous offer, even considering the inflation.  I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, recognizing the impact of inflation. This offer is still advantageous for me, but also leaves room for negotiation in case Bob wants to see a different split."
