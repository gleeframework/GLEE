Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, Alice, but we need to make a deal soon. The money is losing value quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is offering more than the initial 50/50 split, it's important to remember that the value of his share is decreasing rapidly due to the inflation rule. I'm aiming to secure a larger portion of the money while it's still worth a significant amount to Bob.  I'm willing to push a little further in hopes of a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking.  This is my final offer.  Take it or we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but with the time pressure and rapidly devaluing money for Bob, I need to make a decision. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable sum.  Rejecting it carries a significant risk of getting nothing if Bob is set on this being his ""final offer."""
