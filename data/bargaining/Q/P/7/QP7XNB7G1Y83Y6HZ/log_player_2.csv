Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 4000 for me, I'll try to counter with a slightly higher amount. But considering the inflation, I'll aim for a lower total amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, Alice's offer seems more reasonable now. The amount I would gain in this round is significantly lower than in the first round, but I'm not sure how much Alice is affected by inflation.
