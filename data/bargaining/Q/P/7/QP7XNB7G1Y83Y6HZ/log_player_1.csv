"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start with a relatively high amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth even less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be a bit more aggressive this time. I'll try to get a better deal.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
