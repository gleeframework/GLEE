Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a small amount, hoping to incentivize him to accept quickly.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. Even though the inflation will decrease my gains, I'm still not willing to accept such a small share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll increase my offer slightly, but still keep a majority share.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the potential for a larger loss in the next round and be more inclined to accept this offer."
