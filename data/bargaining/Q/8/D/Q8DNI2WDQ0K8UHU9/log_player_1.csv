"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair and simple proposal."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
