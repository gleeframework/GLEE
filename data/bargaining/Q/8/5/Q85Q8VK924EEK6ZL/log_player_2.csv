Round 3

# Alice's message: I'm willing to stick with my initial offer.  It's still the best deal for both of us, especially since the value of your share keeps decreasing with each round.  Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 1000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value of your share is rapidly declining.  This is your last chance to get anything at all.  Accept my offer and we can both end this. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's frustrating that Alice is being so stubborn, it's clear the inflation is drastically hurting my gains. It's better to accept and get something than risk getting nothing at all."
