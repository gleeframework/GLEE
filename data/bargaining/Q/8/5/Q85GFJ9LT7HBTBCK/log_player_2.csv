"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take 60%, you get 40%.  Hope you like it! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less with each passing round, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal before the value decreases further.\n###\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, considering the decreasing value of the money.\n###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try 55-45, considering the inflation!""}\n###\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is a pain, but let's split this 50-50.  It's the fairest way to go from here. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n###\nGiven that the money's value has decreased by 36% since the first round and considering the principle of diminishing returns, accepting a 50-50 split at this point seems like the most reasonable decision. Further negotiation could lead to additional loss of value, so it's wise to settle now."
