This offer is extremely unfavorable to me. I'll see if I can do better in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'm proposing a much fairer split, with me receiving $9,000 and Alice receiving $1,000.  This seems like a good starting point for a negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the first round, it's still not a fair split. I will try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm offering a slight concession to Alice by increasing her share to $2,000, while still keeping the majority for myself at $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the inflation we're both experiencing."

# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer is becoming more generous, but it's still not a fair split.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm offering a balanced proposal. While I'm still taking the larger share, I'm recognizing Alice's increasing share in the previous round. This seems like a good compromise to avoid both of us getting nothing at the end."

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but it's still not fair enough considering the inflation we're both experiencing. I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Alice getting $4,000. This feels like a good compromise, considering the inflation we've both experienced. We're getting closer to a 50/50 split, but it's important to acknowledge the value of our initial investments."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is finally a 50/50 split. Even though the inflation has severely reduced the value of the money, it's still better than getting nothing. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
