"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving me a large share, but ensuring Bob gets something as well. This sets a precedent for negotiation, and hopefully encourages a swift agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share again to 8000, but increasing Bob's to 2000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm aware of the value decreasing with each round. I hope this encourages Bob to accept before the value drops further."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable as the rounds progress.  While the value of my share is dropping significantly, his is dropping even faster. I'm willing to wait and see if he'll make a more equitable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but also offering a larger share to Bob to show my willingness to negotiate. With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly, so it's important to find a solution before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. While my share has dropped, his share has dropped even more significantly. I'm hopeful that he'll recognize the diminishing value of the money and make a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm making a final push for a 6000/4000 split. We're nearing the end of the game, and the value of the money is continuing to decline rapidly. This offer is a compromise that balances the need for a reasonable share with the urgency of reaching an agreement before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is better than previous rounds, it's still significantly skewed towards Bob.  Given the rapid depreciation of value, I'm hoping to see a fairer split in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're running out of time. Given the rapid inflation and the fact that we'll get nothing if we can't agree, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest and most likely option for both of us to get a decent share before the value depreciates further."
