Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit lopsided.  Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects that I'll be taking on more risk as the game goes on. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
