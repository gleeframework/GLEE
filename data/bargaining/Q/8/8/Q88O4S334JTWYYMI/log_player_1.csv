"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time. 60 for me, 40 for you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more even, but I'm not sure I want to give up 60. I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 55, I need a bit more for myself""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to 55 for me, take the rest""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it!"
