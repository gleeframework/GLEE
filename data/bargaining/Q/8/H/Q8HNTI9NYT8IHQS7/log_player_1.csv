"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, I'll take the risk!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're taking a risk, I'll take a fair share! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $20 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'm being taken advantage of. I'd rather not accept this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80%). I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money I'd gain being worth only 51.2% of what it was in the first round, I'm getting really desperate.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 85% of the remaining money, but I'm not sure I have much of a choice. I'd rather accept this offer and end the game than risk losing even more in future rounds.
