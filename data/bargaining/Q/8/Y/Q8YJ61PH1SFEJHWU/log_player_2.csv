"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible starting offer! I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a deal where I get a tiny fraction of the money.  Let's see if she's serious about negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That's a very generous offer Alice, but I think we can do better for both of us. How about this split?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise, Bob. I'm willing to give you more, but I still need to get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is slowly moving in the right direction, but this deal is still much better for her than it is for me, especially with inflation eating away at the value. I need to push for a more favorable split before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
