"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll give you a chance to accept""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a 80-20 split, which is a relatively generous offer, but still leaves me with the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less in the second round, my potential gain is now $4,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it for now. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to maximize my gain. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less again, my potential gain is now $3,600 (10,000 * 0.9^2).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not giving in yet! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less than the initial amount, my potential gain is now $2,310 (10,000 * (1 - 0.271)^3).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it again. I'm not getting a good deal, and I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to maximize my gain. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 27.1% less than the initial amount, my potential gain is now $2,310 (10,000 * (1 - 0.271)^3).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting low on time, let's make a deal before it's too late""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, which is a relatively aggressive split, but I'm trying to maximize my gain with the limited time left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting late, but I'm not going to back down now! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 40.95% less than the initial amount, my potential gain is now $1,590 (10,000 * (1 - 0.4095)^4).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. It's a 50-50 split, and with the money being worth so much less, I'd rather take the deal than risk getting nothing. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
