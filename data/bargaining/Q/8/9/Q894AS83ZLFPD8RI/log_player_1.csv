"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping to take almost everything.  I'm banking on Bob being greedy and wanting to take a shot at getting even more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm getting less than I wanted in the first round, I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round.  It's better to take the guaranteed 600,000 now."
