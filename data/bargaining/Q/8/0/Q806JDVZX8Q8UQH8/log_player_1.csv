"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should switch roles.  You got a good deal last time, so let's see if you'll accept this one! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Nice try, Bob!

I'll reject your offer for Round 2. I'm not interested in switching roles just yet.
