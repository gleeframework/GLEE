"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, giving each of us $5,000. This is a fair and simple way to begin, and we can always adjust later if we need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4000/6000 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the inflation effect.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that we can revisit the split later in the game.
