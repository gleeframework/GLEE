"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor, as Alice.  This allows me to secure most of the money in the first round, knowing that the value will decrease with each subsequent round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation makes it clear that the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even though it's less than I initially hoped for."
