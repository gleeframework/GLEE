"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total. Accept? 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's always worth seeing if Alice will offer more! Let's see if she'll improve her proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think it's time we split the money more evenly. How about 55% for me and 45% for you?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll give you 40% of the remaining value. Accept? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a significant improvement from her first proposal, and while I'd prefer a higher percentage, the inflation risk makes accepting this offer the safer option."
