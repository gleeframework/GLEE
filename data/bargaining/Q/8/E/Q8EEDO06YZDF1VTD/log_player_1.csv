"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total. Accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we split the money more evenly. How about 55% for me and 45% for you? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer, I think 55% for Bob is a bit too high. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too generous for you. How about 50-50?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'll give you 40% of the remaining value. Accept?""
}
```"
