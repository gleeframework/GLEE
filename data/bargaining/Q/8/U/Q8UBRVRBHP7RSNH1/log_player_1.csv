"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority but you'll still get a decent share.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering we both lose money with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much, I'll take 50 and you can have 50.""}

I'm proposing that we split the money equally, with each of us getting $50."
