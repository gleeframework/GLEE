"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I get a bit more""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since the money loses value for Bob with each passing round, he has an incentive to accept the offer sooner rather than later. I'm offering him a significant amount, but still trying to maximize my own gain. I'm also adding a message to try to persuade him that the offer is fair. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it more evenly. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because I think I can get a better deal. Since the money loses value for Bob with each passing round, I'm in a stronger negotiating position. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get a more favorable offer. Additionally, I initially offered Bob $400,000 and he rejected it, so I don't feel like I should accept the same amount now. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""You didn't take my first offer, now the deal is less sweet for you""}\n\nI'm increasing my share and decreasing Bob's share, taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to him with each passing round. I'm also sending a message to remind him that he had the opportunity to accept a better offer earlier, and now the deal is less favorable for him. I'm hoping this will put pressure on him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than the last one. Let's split it closer to 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because I think Bob is still trying to get too good of a deal. Although he's compromising, the fact that the money is worth 27.1% less to him than in the first round means that his $550,000 is actually worth significantly less than it would have been initially. Meanwhile, my share remains the same value. I think I can still get a better deal, so I'll proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""You're running out of time, the deal won't get better for you""}\n\nI'm increasing my share again and decreasing Bob's share, taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth even less to him with each passing round. I'm also sending a message to put pressure on him, reminding him that the deal won't get better for him if he continues to reject my offers. I'm hoping he'll realize that it's in his best interest to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm tired of this game. Let's just split it down the middle. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting this offer because, although I was trying to get a better deal, splitting the money exactly in half is a reasonable compromise. Considering the significant loss of value for Bob due to inflation, his $500,000 is actually worth much less than mine. I think this is a fair outcome, and I'm willing to end the game here.
