Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my absolute final offer. It accounts for the inflation hitting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3280 
# Alice gain: 6720 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I will accept this offer. Considering the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, it seems like the best option to take the 3280, even though it's worth 59.04% less than in the first round. Further rounds would only continue to decrease the value of the money, and there's a risk of ending up with nothing if we don't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds."
