"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll consider the effective gain for me to be 5000 * 0.8 = 4000. And Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so it's 5000 * 0.9 = 4500.

Considering the inflation, I'll reject this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $10,000, leaving 30% for Bob."
