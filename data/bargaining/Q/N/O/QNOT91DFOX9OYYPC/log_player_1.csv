"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and leaving $30 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $50 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $40.

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
