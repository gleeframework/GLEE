600000.0,400000.0,I propose dividing the money with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This is a fair offer considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,

500000.0,500000.0,"Considering the inflation, I believe a 50/50 split would be fair for both of us. It ensures a balanced distribution while accounting for the decreasing value of money in each subsequent round.",Alice,3,
