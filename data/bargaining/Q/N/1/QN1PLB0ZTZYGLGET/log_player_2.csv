Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair in principle, the inflation heavily favors Bob.  Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are steadily getting better for Bob.  He can likely push for an even larger share in the remaining rounds."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking, and I'm not budging any further.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The end is near. This offer represents a significant share for Bob, capitalizing on the inflation disadvantage for Alice. It's a bold move, but given Alice's increasing desperation, it may be enough to secure a win for Bob."
