"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. We both lose money with every round, so it's best to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Even though Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, I'm losing money to inflation every round.  I need to push for a slightly better deal to make up for the losses."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5800,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, another round won't benefit either of us. Let's split it evenly again. It's the fairest and most logical solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

This is tricky. While Bob is right about losing more to inflation, accepting now means I've lost almost half the value from my initial ask. I need to hold out a little longer and hope he's willing to negotiate to avoid getting nothing."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm really feeling the inflation pinch! This is a compromise to settle it now before it hurts us both even more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are running out of time.  I am willing to split the money evenly one last time.  It's a fair deal, and if we keep going, we will both lose a lot more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

The inflation is eating away at the potential gains, and time is running out.  While not ideal, taking the even split now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
