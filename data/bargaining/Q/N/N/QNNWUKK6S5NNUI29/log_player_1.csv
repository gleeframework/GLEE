"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000. This is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm essentially losing 100,000 in value due to inflation. Bob's offer of 400,000 is not enough to compensate for the loss, and I think I deserve more considering the inflation factor.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

I'm increasing the offer to 550,000 for myself, which is a 10,000 increase from the initial offer. This should help to account for the inflation and give me a bit more breathing room. I'm hoping Bob will consider this a fair compromise."
