"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fair and reasonable starting point, giving me a slight advantage due to the higher inflation rate for Bob.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't let him!  I'm going to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to offer an even split this round.  Since Bob is experiencing a higher inflation rate, he'll be motivated to accept this offer.  It's the best way to ensure we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the better end of the deal, but inflation is hitting him hard. I'm going to keep pushing for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly better deal this round, acknowledging the inflation he's facing. This is a calculated risk, but I believe it's necessary to get him to accept.  Let's see if this works!"
