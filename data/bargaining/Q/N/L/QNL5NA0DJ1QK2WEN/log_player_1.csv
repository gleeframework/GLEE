"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to start with. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the 20% decrease in value for him. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to counter. Will you give me a better deal now? 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to try to counter my initial offer.

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to give Bob 80% of the remaining money, especially since the money he gains is worth 20% less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a fair share. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I've reduced my share from 60 to 45, and increased Bob's share from 40 to 55, trying to find a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to meet you in the middle now. Will you accept a slight edge for me? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking its toll, and Bob's offer is looking more attractive now.

I'll consider the offer...

I'll accept this offer. With the money being worth less and less each round, I think it's better to settle for a smaller share now rather than risking not getting anything if we don't reach an agreement.
