"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and straightforward proposal to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take a larger share of the pie!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is trying to take an even larger share this time!

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

This offer is a compromise that still gives me a slightly larger share, but leaves Bob with a decent amount as well."
