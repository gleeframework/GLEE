"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more since you're losing value each round, and I'm not. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6400,
""bob_gain"": 3600,
""message"": ""I need a larger share to compensate for inflation, Bob. This offer is my bottom line.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the larger share since my money isn't losing value. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is taking advantage of the situation and slowly increasing his offer. While his offer is getting better, time is working against me more strongly. I need to hold out for a better offer to make up for the inflation losses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is a compromise.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Alice.  It's crucial to reach a deal soon.
* **Concession:** Showing a willingness to move closer to Bob's offer might encourage him to be more flexible.
* **Framing:**  Presenting the offer as a ""compromise"" and highlighting that they are ""close to a deal"" could make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I think I deserve the larger portion considering the growing inflation impact on your side. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

The situation is getting dire. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, consider these points:

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me.
* **Inflation Impact:** Accepting $4000 now is better than potentially getting a slightly better offer in later rounds where inflation will have eroded its value even further. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer more, and we risk walking away with nothing if we don't reach an agreement. 

This is a tough decision, but at this stage, accepting is the less risky option."
