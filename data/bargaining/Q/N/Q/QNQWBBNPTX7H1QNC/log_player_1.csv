I propose a split of $900,000 for myself and $100,000 for Bob. This leaves some room for negotiation in future rounds, but gives Bob a decent starting point."

I propose a split of $800,000 for myself and $200,000 for Bob.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm offering him a bit more, but still keeping a significant portion for myself.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."

```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is more than his last offer.  We're getting closer to the middle ground, and I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him.  We're running out of time, and I still want a good share of the money."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to continue to reject Bob's offers. He's losing value faster than me and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep pushing for a larger share."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 this round.  He's losing a lot of value with each round, and I'm hoping the pressure will motivate him to accept a deal that's more favorable to me.  We're nearing the end of the game, and I'm not willing to give up too much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. Even though he's losing value quickly, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal if I keep pushing.  I'm not going to settle for a 40/60 split when I know I can likely get closer to 50/50."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 this round.  Time is running out, and I need to start making concessions.  I'm willing to go slightly lower than my previous offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant share.  This is a strong offer given the rapidly decreasing value of Bob's money."
