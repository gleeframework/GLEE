"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, this time I'll take a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's now my turn again. Here's my offer for Round 3:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, meet me halfway!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It seems like we're repeating ourselves. Here's my offer again for Round 3:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, meet me halfway!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIt's getting serious now. Given the inflation and the fact that this is Bob's ""final offer,"" I'll think carefully about my decision.\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to consider if 50% of the devalued amount is acceptable. Meanwhile, Bob's share is only 14.26% less valuable, making his 50% more valuable than mine.\n\nHowever, considering we're already in Round 4 and the money's value is decreasing, I might not get a better offer in the future rounds. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus the risk of getting less in the subsequent rounds.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's hope this decision pays off!"
