"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than my first offer. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I think you can do better considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is correct that the rapidly decreasing value of the money puts me in a tough spot, accepting 44% now (worth even less due to inflation) is a terrible deal.  I need to firmly push for a better split, or I risk getting a truly paltry sum as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is non-negotiable.  We need to split this evenly while it's still worthwhile for both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The devaluation is becoming critical.  While I want a larger share, holding out further dramatically increases the risk of walking away with practically nothing.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point, and hopefully, Alice will see the urgency."
