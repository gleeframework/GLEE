"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me a significant share (90%) while still leaving Bob with a small amount. I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize him to accept, especially considering the inflation risk in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's not worth risking further inflation and potential for a worse deal later. Accepting this offer guarantees me 50% of the remaining value, which is better than the risk of getting less in the next round."
