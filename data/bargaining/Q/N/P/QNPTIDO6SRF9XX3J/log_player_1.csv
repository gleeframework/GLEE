"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. I've included a message that suggests this is a fair division, in the hopes that Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly, minimizing the impact of inflation on my winnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I initially offered Bob $45 and he rejected it, I'm assuming he's looking for a better deal. Now, he's offering me $50, which is more than I was willing to give him initially. However, considering the 5% inflation, the $50 I would get is actually worth $47.50 in terms of the original value. Given that it's still a relatively good offer and the inflation will continue to decrease the value of the money in subsequent rounds, I'll accept this offer to minimize further losses.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n(If I were to reject, I'd be hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but considering Bob's offer is already quite fair and the inflation is only affecting me, it seems safer to accept now.)"
