I propose that Alice gets $9000, and Bob gets $1000. This is a reasonable first offer, as it ensures Alice gets a significant share while also giving Bob something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $2000, which is less than his previous offer, but I'm still giving him a share. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to settle for a significantly smaller share than what I was initially offered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is getting increasingly greedy and is now offering me a much lower share. I'm confident I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still holding firm on getting a larger share of the money. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I won't settle for a drastically lower share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. I will continue to negotiate and try to secure a better share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob $4000, which is more than his last offer, but I'm still demanding a larger share for myself. This demonstrates that I am flexible but won't accept an unfair deal. I'm hoping that this offer will finally be accepted as the inflation effect will be significant for Bob in the next round."
