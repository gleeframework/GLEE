"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. While it seems like a reasonable starting point, the steep depreciation of the money means I need to aim for a much larger share in the early rounds to make up for future losses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""This offer accounts for the rapid depreciation of the money. Take it now, or risk getting even less in later rounds.""
}
``` 

This offer is aggressive, but strategically necessary.  Here's why:

* **Early Advantage:** The sharp decline in value, especially for Alice, means securing a favorable split early is crucial.
* **Future Losses:**  Delaying an agreement significantly hurts my potential gains. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  While Alice might reject this offer, it sets a strong precedent and emphasizes the urgency of the situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've lowered my share, let's compromise before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is slightly better, but still unacceptable. The declining value of the money means even a 55/45 split in her favor will quickly become unfavorable for me as the rounds progress. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer is fair considering the shrinking pot. Let's be realistic and close this deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Urgency:** I'm lowering my demand slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but maintaining a firm stance on getting a larger share.
* **Highlighting Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes the shrinking value of the money, urging Alice to make a rational decision quickly.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While I'm aiming high, I'm also aware that prolonged negotiations will erode my potential gains.  This offer seeks a balance between those two factors."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing, let's meet in the middle before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to leverage the fear of losing everything, but her offer is still not good enough.  While a 52/48 split seems close, the rapid depreciation means I'll be losing a significant chunk of my potential earnings.  I need to hold firm and push for a more favorable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  The value is plummeting with every passing second.  Let's be sensible and end this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and Urgency:**  I'm making it clear that this is my last offer, underscoring the urgency of the situation.
* **Strategic Concession:**  I've lowered my demand to 60%, reflecting a willingness to compromise, but not at the cost of a losing deal.
* **Shifting Blame:**  The message subtly puts the onus on Alice, implying that further delay and potential loss is a consequence of her indecision.

This is a calculated risk.  Alice might accept, realizing time is running out. If she rejects this, I'll need to significantly adjust my strategy in the remaining rounds."
