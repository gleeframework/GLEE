"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's reasonable and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but I'm prepared to make a counter-offer if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is slightly better for him, but it's still fair.  It's not worth risking further rounds and inflation to try to get more."
