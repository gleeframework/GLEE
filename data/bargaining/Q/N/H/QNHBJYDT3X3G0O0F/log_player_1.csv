"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal!""}\n\nI'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself since I'm initiating the proposal, but it's still a relatively fair split. The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to persuade Bob to accept the offer and conclude the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, take it or leave it. This is your last chance for a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation and the fact that Bob's offer still gives him a significantly larger share, I've decided to reject it. The message from Bob tries to create a sense of urgency, but considering the game's mechanics and the decreasing value of money, I believe there's still room for negotiation that could result in a more favorable outcome for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle and call it a day!""}\n\nGiven the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I've decided to propose an equal split. This is a straightforward and fair offer that considers the impact of inflation on both of our gains. The message is concise and suggests ending the game on a mutually beneficial note."
