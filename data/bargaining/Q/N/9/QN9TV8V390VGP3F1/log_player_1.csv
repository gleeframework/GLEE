"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, acknowledging that we both have equal power in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my offer to 60/40.  Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm still willing to give Bob a fair share, but I need to make sure I get a larger portion to compensate for the decreasing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has impacted the value of the money significantly, a 50/50 split is the best outcome considering the current circumstances. Accepting this offer ensures I get something rather than risking getting nothing in future rounds."
