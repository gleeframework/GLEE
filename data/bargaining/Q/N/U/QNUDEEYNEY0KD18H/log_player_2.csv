"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm happy to take a little less to make sure we both get something! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something, it's only 40 dollars. Since I know inflation is in effect, I think I can do better by making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
