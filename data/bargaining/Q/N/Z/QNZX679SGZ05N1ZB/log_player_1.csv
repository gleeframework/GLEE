"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, my offer in the second round would be 10% of 90, which is 9. So, I'd get 9 dollars if I were to make a new offer.

However, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable proposal. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
