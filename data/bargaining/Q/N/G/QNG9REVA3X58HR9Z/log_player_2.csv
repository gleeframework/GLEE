"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is terrible! While 10 dollars is better than nothing, there's definitely room for a better deal.  Let's see if we can get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
``` 
Let's start with a fair and equal split. I believe this is the most sensible approach, as it's the fairest way to divide the money."
