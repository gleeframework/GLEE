"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering you got a better deal in the last round. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4800. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 75% of what it was in the first round, which is $4500.

I'm not sure I like the 60/40 split, considering the inflation and the fact that I got a better deal in the first round. I'd like to keep pushing for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 64% of its original value. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $4,500, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's end the game here.""
