Round 4

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant drop in value for you, I'm adjusting my offer accordingly. This is a better reflection of our current positions 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, accepting Bob's offer of $35 is better than risking even further losses from inflation in future rounds."
