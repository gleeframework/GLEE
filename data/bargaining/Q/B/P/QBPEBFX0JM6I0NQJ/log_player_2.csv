"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get $60, you get $40. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money's value doesn't decrease for me but does for Alice, I have an incentive to delay the agreement. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the depreciation on your end""}\n\n###\nGiven that the money's value decreases by 10% for Alice with each round, I'm in a stronger position as the rounds progress. My strategy is to start with a moderate offer that slightly favors me, considering Alice might be more inclined to accept sooner rather than later due to the devaluing of her potential gain over time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting hard, Bob. I need $55, you take $45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nGiven that Alice's gain is worth 19% less than in the first round and my gain remains unaffected, I see an opportunity to push for a better deal. The incentive for me to delay agreement remains, as each round diminishes Alice's potential gain without affecting mine. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can negotiate a more favorable split.\n\n###\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the significant depreciation on your end, I think this is a fair adjustment""}\n\n###\nGiven the increasing depreciation of Alice's potential gain (now 19% less valuable than the initial round), I'm adjusting my offer to favor myself more. Since I'm not affected by the inflation, I have a stronger bargaining position with each passing round. This offer still leaves Alice with a substantial amount, but it reflects the changing value of the money due to inflation.\n\n###\nLet's see how Alice responds to this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. This is going nowhere. 50/50 is the only fair deal at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nDespite Alice's appeal to fairness, the economic reality of the game gives me an advantage. With her gain now worth 34.39% less than in the first round and mine unaffected, a 50/50 split does not reflect the current value of the money to each of us. I'll continue to push for a better deal, considering the depreciation on her side.\n\n###\nLet's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Given the significant drop in value for you, I'm adjusting my offer accordingly. This is a better reflection of our current positions""}\n\n###\nWith Alice's potential gain now worth 34.39% less than initially, I'm in a strong position to negotiate a more favorable deal. My offer of 65/35 may seem aggressive, but it accounts for the substantial depreciation of the money's value to Alice. I'm betting that the increasing loss of value will incentivize her to accept this offer rather than risk further devaluation in subsequent rounds.\n\n###\nLet's see how Alice responds!"
