"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a larger share of the pie.

I'll think about it... 

I'll reject this offer. I don't want to give up 60% of the money!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a sweet spot.

I'll think about it... 

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to give up 70% of the money, even if it's worth less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was still a bit too aggressive, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal this time. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk, but I think I deserve more. Are you willing to compromise?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up much more, you're going to have to make a better offer if you want me to accept. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive and is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me.

I'll think about it... 

I'll reject this offer. Giving up 99% of the money is not acceptable to me, even if it's worth less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was extremely aggressive, I'll try to make a more extreme proposal this time. Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up much more. If you want to accept, now is the time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, which is a very unfavorable split for Bob. I'm hoping he'll realize that this is the best offer he's going to get and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give you anything, I'm taking it all. 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take all the money for himself!

I'll think about it... 

I'll reject this offer. Giving Bob 0 dollars is not an option, and I'd rather go to the next round than let him take everything.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too extreme, I'll try to make a more realistic proposal this time. Here's my offer for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's go back to the original proposal. It's only fair.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is the same as my original offer. I'm hoping Bob will see sense and accept this reasonable proposal."
