I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This is a very generous offer, and I believe it's in Bob's best interest to accept it, as he'll still receive a decent amount.  Let's get this done quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2160 
# Bob gain: 7840 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is nowhere near as generous as my initial proposal. I will not accept this, and I am confident I can get a much better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
``` 

I'm offering a 7000/3000 split in my favor. This is a fair and reasonable offer given the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer. I believe this offer gives us both a decent amount of money, and I hope Bob will finally accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3808 
# Bob gain: 6192 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, even considering the inflation. I refuse to settle for such a low amount. I believe I can secure a much better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  Given the increasingly severe inflation, and the fact that both of us have been stubborn thus far, this seems like the fairest option. We can both walk away with a significant amount of money, and avoid the risk of getting nothing.  It's time to be reasonable."
