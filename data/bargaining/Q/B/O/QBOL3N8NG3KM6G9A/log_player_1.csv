# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation situation. I need to hold firm to get a better deal, even though the value is decreasing. It's still better to get a smaller share of a larger pie than to cave to his demands."
