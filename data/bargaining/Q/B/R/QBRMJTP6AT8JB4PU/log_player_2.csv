Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems fair for the first round.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I think we can do better.  Let's see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose with extreme positions. I'm coming down a bit, you should too. 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer. While Alice has lowered her demand, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I believe we can still reach a more equitable agreement.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's split the money evenly. A 50/50 split is the most fair way to divide the money, especially given the inflation we're facing. Let's avoid further losses and agree on this.""}
