"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and I'll take the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, Bob's offer is actually:

* Alice gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36 (since Alice's gain is worth 10% less)
* Bob gain: 60 * 0.95 = 57 (since Bob's gain is worth 5% less)

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
