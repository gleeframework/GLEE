"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is better, let's go with 55-45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'm not sure if 45 is a good enough offer, considering the inflation effect. I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round. Considering this, I'll aim for a slightly higher gain.
