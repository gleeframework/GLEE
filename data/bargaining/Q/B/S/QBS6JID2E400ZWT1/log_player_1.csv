"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll give you 60% this round, will you take it? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...
