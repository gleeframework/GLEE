"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'll propose a very generous split, keeping 999,000 for myself and giving Bob 1,000.  This way, I maximize my potential gain while still offering him something.  It's unlikely he'll reject this in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something. The inflation factor means that rejecting this offer might result in nothing for me in the next round. It's better to secure a small gain than risk getting nothing at all."
