"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a division where I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced offer. Consider this one. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting me, my offer needs to be even more aggressive to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better offer from me, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a division where I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000. It's a tough offer, but I think I can do better than this in the next round if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not too much. Consider this offer. 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get. I think I can do better than this. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting me even more, my offer needs to be even more aggressive. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a division where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. It's a tough offer, but I think I can do better than this in the next round if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down yet. I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect much more. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later, and Bob's offer is actually better than my previous one. I'll take the $7,000 and hope that I made the right decision."
