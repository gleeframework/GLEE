"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping to secure a deal early on, but I'm also mindful of the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable, and while the inflation is real, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate something more equitable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly more balanced split this time. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to ensure I get a fair share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the inflation is starting to bite, I'm still going to reject this offer. Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering an even split in this round.  The inflation is getting significant, and I think this is a fair compromise that we can both agree on.  It's better than risking losing everything with further negotiation."
