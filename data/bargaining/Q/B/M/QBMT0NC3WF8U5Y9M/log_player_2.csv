Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. We both get a decent share this way. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time. This offer is more than fair, and the clock is ticking!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but we need to find a solution quickly. Let's compromise. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While time is running out, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for Bob due to the inflation.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. Bob needs to hold firm and hope Alice becomes more reasonable in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Take it or leave it!""} 
```

**Reasoning:** It's time for Bob to put his foot down and offer a firm 50/50 split. This emphasizes that the inflation is significantly impacting him, and continuing to lowball him will only lead to both of them losing out. The ""take it or leave it"" tone conveys the urgency of the situation."
