"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly.  I'll take 60%, you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take 60% this time, but I'm open to negotiating if you think that's unfair.  Let's work out a deal that benefits us both!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly this time.  Inflation is affecting us both, so let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 5000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
