I'm going for a big chunk, but I'm leaving Bob with something to keep him interested.  Let's see how he feels about that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd love to have more, I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to play this game. Inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and Bob's offer is a good starting point.  It's a fair split, and I'm willing to take it."
