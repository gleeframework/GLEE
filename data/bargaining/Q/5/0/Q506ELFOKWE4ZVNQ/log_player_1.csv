"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, considering the value of the money will decrease over time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer is much fairer, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied. Let's end this game and get our share! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer is indeed fairer than my previous one, and the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round, I'll accept Bob's offer.
