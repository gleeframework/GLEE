"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n### 

In this offer, Alice proposes to take 60% of the money ($600,000) and leave 40% ($400,000) for Bob, with a message suggesting a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but inflation is a real concern. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

I'll reject Bob's offer, as I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me, I don't have to worry about inflation, but Bob does. This gives me some leverage to negotiate for a better share. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is indeed a concern, for you""}\n\n### 

In this offer, I'm taking advantage of the fact that the money is worth the same to me, but less to Bob due to inflation. I'm proposing to take 70% of the money ($700,000) and leave 30% ($300,000) for Bob, with a message that acknowledges the impact of inflation on Bob's gains. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  It's better for you than waiting any longer. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

I'll reject Bob's offer again, as I believe I can still get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me, I don't have to worry about inflation, but Bob does. With each passing round, Bob's gains are worth less and less, which gives me more leverage to negotiate for a better share. I'll wait for the next round to see if Bob will make an even better offer or if I can make a more favorable proposal. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""You should have taken the previous deals""}\n\n### 

In this offer, I'm taking an even more aggressive stance, proposing to take 80% of the money ($800,000) and leave 20% ($200,000) for Bob. With the money being worth the same to me but significantly less to Bob due to inflation, I believe I have the upper hand in the negotiations. My message is a bit cheeky, pointing out that Bob should have taken one of the previous deals, implying that this offer might be the last chance for Bob to get anything. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
