"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to start. This gives us both something and avoids us getting nothing if we run out of rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split? It's still in your favor, considering the inflation, but gives me a better deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground.  I'll take my previous offer down to 55/45. It still reflects the time pressure with the inflation, but gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
