45.0,55.0,"Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split? It's still in your favor, considering the inflation, but gives me a better deal.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground.  I'll take my previous offer down to 55/45. It still reflects the time pressure with the inflation, but gets us closer to a deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, it seems we're both being stubborn. Time is literally money for you with this inflation.  Let's just split it evenly at 50/50 and call it a day.",Bob,4,
