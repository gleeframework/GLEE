Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering I'm the one making the initial offer."
