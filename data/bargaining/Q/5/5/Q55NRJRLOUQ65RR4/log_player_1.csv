I'm offering Bob a small share to start with, hoping he'll accept and we can end this quickly.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than what he offered in the first round, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to wait a few more rounds to see if he'll get more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to  $55, hoping to entice Bob to accept.  It's still a good deal for me, considering the inflation."
