Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive opening offer. I figure Bob might be tempted to take it, but if not, I'll have a chance to adjust in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial proposal.  I'm not going to accept such a drastic change, especially since the money is worth less now. I'll counter with a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split. While the inflation has hurt my gains, I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a favorable outcome. This offer shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not giving in completely to Bob's demands."
