Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it won't get better for me, but it's actually getting better for me each round. $70 for me, $30 for you. The longer we play, the less your share is worth. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70

Bob is clearly exploiting the situation and knows my position weakens each round. If I reject this offer, there's a good chance he'll push for even more in the next round, leaving me with even less value after inflation. It's a bad deal, but better than holding out for an unlikely improvement."
