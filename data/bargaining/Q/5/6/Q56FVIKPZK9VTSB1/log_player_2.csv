"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. 60/40 split seems like a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I can try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'll try to take advantage of this and offer a split that is more favorable to me. I'll also include a message to justify my proposal and try to persuade Alice to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money now, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer since the split is now more even and the inflation is affecting Alice's gain more significantly. It's a good time to lock in the deal before the inflation further devalues Alice's share.
###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
