This offer is getting ridiculous. I'm not accepting such a small share, especially with the value of the money decreasing significantly. I'll keep fighting for a better split."

This offer is completely unacceptable. I'm not going to settle for a pittance, especially when the value of the money is plummeting. I'm still willing to negotiate a fair deal, but I'm not going to give in to Bob's greed."

Round 9

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  We're running out of time, and the money is worth less with each passing round. A fair split is the only way to ensure we both get something."
