4750.0,5250.0,"Your offer was quite reasonable, Alice, and I appreciate the sentiment of a near-even split.  However, since I'm now taking on the risk, I propose we simply reverse the amounts for this round. This still ensures a near 50/50 split while accounting for the shift in bargaining power.",Bob,2,
