Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. Let's end this before inflation hurts us both further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Bob.  Each round that passes makes the potential gains less appealing for both of us.
* **Bob's Final Offer:**  Bob has indicated this is his final offer.  There's no guarantee that future rounds will result in a better deal, and they could be significantly worse.
* **Better Than Nothing:** Accepting 45% of a shrinking pot is still better than potentially ending up with nothing if we reach a stalemate and the game ends with no agreement. 

It's a tough decision, but the risk of getting a worse outcome in later rounds outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal."
