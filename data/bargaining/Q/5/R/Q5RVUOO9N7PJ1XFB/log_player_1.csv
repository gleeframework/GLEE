"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 5% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money is worth less for Bob. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving away all the profit!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain!

Considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45/55 split, especially since Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm still willing to compromise!""
}

I'm increasing my share to 60, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offers. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle!

Considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation, I think this is a good opportunity to accept a fair split.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept the 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and I'm willing to compromise to end the game!"
