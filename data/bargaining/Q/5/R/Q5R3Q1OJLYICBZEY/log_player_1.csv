Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a fair cut too. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's close the deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise. Let's settle this before inflation hurts us both further. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly.  We are already in round 4, and waiting longer drastically reduces the overall payout.
* **Declining Returns:**  While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a smaller share later due to inflation or even reaching no agreement at all. 
* **Fair Compromise:** Bob's offer shows he's willing to compromise. Accepting this offer prevents a stalemate and ensures we both walk away with something."
