"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. This leaves me with a good chunk of the money, and hopefully, avoids the risk of inflation eating into my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more than 5000, it's better than nothing. Inflation has already eaten into my potential earnings, and accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount. There's no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything in the next round, and the inflation will keep reducing my share."
