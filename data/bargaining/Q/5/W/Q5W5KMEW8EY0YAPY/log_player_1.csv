"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too generous to yourself, Alice. How about a more balanced split this time? 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my next offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 58-42 is a fair compromise.""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. Let's be practical and end this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll consider Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI decided to accept Bob's offer since the difference between our proposed splits is relatively small, and further rounds would lead to more significant losses due to inflation. By accepting this offer, I ensure a gain of $4900, which, although not the initial 60% I aimed for, is still a considerable amount, and continuing the game might result in less value due to inflation."
