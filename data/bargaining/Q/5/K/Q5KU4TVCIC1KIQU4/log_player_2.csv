"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a more aggressive offer. Since Alice was willing to split 50/50 in round 1, I'll try to get a better deal now that the stakes are higher due to inflation.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Alice is offering me a smaller share than before, but still a significant amount. I'll consider it.
