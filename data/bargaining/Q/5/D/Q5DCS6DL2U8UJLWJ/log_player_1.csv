"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. I'm framing it as a fair split to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I believe this is a more equitable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $49 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $46.55.

I'm not convinced that this is a more equitable starting point, and I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
