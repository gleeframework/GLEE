49.0,51.0,"I'm feeling generous this round.  Let's split it closer to even, but I'll take the bigger share.  What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm taking a small hit due to inflation, so how about I get $58, and you get $42? This is a fair deal considering time is working against me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject

,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The clock is ticking, and we both lose if we don't agree. I'm dropping my offer to $56, you get $44. Take it before inflation eats away at this deal even more!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
47.0,53.0,"Alice, we're both losing out here. Let's just split it a little closer to even and move on.  I'm sticking with my previous offer - take it or we both risk losing everything.",Bob,6,

53.0,47.0,"Bob, this is my final offer.  You've rejected every attempt to find a middle ground. I get it, you want more than half.  I'm willing to accept a smaller share than my original offer, but I won't be taken advantage of.  It's $53 for me, $47 for you.  Let's end this.",Alice,7,
