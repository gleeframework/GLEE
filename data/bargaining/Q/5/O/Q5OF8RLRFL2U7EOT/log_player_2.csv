Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a decent share considering the rapid devaluation of your gains over time. It's in our best interest to settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
