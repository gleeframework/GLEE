Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time and the value is plummeting.  This offer is a compromise to end this fairly before we both lose out significantly. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100

Explanation:

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most strategic move at this point. Here's why:

* **Rapid Devaluation:** The money is losing value rapidly, especially for Bob.  Every round that passes significantly diminishes the potential gains for both players.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Waiting for a better offer in later rounds is very risky. The rate of devaluation means any potential increase in your share might be offset by the overall decrease in value.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting the current offer guarantees a reasonable share. Rejecting it puts you at the mercy of Bob's future offers, which might be even less favorable as the pressure mounts.

While Bob's offer is slightly skewed towards him, accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with significantly less if the game continues and the value plummets further."
