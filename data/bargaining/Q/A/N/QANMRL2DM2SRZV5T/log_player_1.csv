"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 600,000$ and leave 400,000$ for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice.  However, I believe a more balanced split would be fairer for both of us. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is the same as mine from Round 1, but with the labels flipped. I'll reject this offer since it's not a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 5% inflation, the value of the money is now worth 95% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk of inflation.""
}
