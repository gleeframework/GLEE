"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. Take this offer and we both win! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```tool_code
Explanation: While the offer seems fair at first glance, Bob should reject it. He can get a better deal in the next round by making his own offer. 
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn! Let's be real, this time I get the better share. Take it or leave it, it'll be worth even less next round.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Goal:** Bob's goal is to maximize his own gain, knowing the value of the money decreases each round.
* **The Strategy:**  Bob rejects Alice's seemingly ""fair"" offer because he knows he can secure a better deal in the next round due to the inflation factor. He proposes a 60/40 split in his favor.
* **The Message:**  The message is framed to create a sense of urgency and pressure Alice into accepting. He highlights the decreasing value of the money, making his offer seem more appealing than waiting for a potentially worse deal in a later round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm taking a small hit from my last offer, let's close this deal before inflation eats away at the value! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Explanation:**

* **The Pressure:** Alice is right, the inflation is eating away at the potential gains. While not ideal, accepting a slightly worse offer now is better than risking an even lower offer from Alice in later rounds. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the difference between a 60/40 split and a 45/55 split really matters. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than hold out for a slightly larger sum that's been diminished by inflation."
