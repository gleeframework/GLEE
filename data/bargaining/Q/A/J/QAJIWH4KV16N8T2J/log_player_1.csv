"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it a little more evenly. I'll take 55% and you take 45%.  It's a better deal for both of us, and we can end this game. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
