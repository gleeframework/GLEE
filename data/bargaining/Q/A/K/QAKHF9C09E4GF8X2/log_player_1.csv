Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit less than 50% to ensure we can both get something.  This accounts for the inflation difference, and still leaves a good amount for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
