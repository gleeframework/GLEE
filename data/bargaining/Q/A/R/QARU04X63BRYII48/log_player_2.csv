Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable. This offer still gives you a significant amount and saves us both from the risks of further inflation.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this back and forth isn't helping.  This offer still gives you a good share and avoids the increasing risk of losing it all. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are reflecting that.  She's clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working against her. While her offers are getting better for me, I still believe I can push for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 575000, ""alice_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and your share is losing value rapidly. This offer is a compromise, giving us both a reasonable payout.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're down to the wire. A 50/50 split is the only fair option left. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice is right. This is getting too risky. A 50/50 split guarantees me a good portion of the money, and at this stage, it's better to secure a win than risk getting nothing at all.  The inflation is really hurting her offers now, and she's unlikely to offer anything better."
