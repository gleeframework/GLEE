"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking $9000 and giving Bob $1000. I want to maximize my gain in the first round, knowing that inflation will eat away at my potential earnings in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While I am losing some money compared to my initial proposal, the inflation rate means that my gains will be significantly reduced in future rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal later on."
