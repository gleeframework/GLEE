"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting 70 dollars and Bob getting 30 dollars. My message to Bob is that I'm offering a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the middle ground, let's end it here 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
Bob gain: 50

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
