"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split it 60/40, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you'd like.  Let's work together to find a fair solution. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to get a slightly better deal. I'll propose a 55/45 split, which is still a compromise but slightly more favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split""}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
