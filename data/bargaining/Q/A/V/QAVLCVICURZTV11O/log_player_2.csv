"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 250,000$ gain is tempting, it's worth holding out to see if Alice will be more generous in future rounds, considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation effect.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd like more, a 450,000$ gain after inflation is still a decent sum. It's better than risking getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers. It seems Alice is willing to compromise, so accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point."
