"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, but slightly in my favor considering the inflation disadvantage I have. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!  I'll take the risk of inflation for now and try to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly. I'm willing to take the risk of inflation for a fair deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want an even split, but I need a bit more to offset the inflation. This is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4850 
# Alice gain: 5150 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer an even split, the inflation is becoming a real factor.  Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and the difference isn't significant enough to risk getting nothing at all."
