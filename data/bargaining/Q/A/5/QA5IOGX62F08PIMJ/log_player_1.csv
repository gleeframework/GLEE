Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is more than fair. The clock is ticking, and I'm feeling the inflation burn. Don't let greed get the best of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is trying to pressure me with the inflation, his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor even with the devaluation.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Let's end this now before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the best offer I'm likely to get at this point.  Bob is catching on to the impact of inflation, and waiting any longer could result in even less favorable offers.  It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting nothing in the end."
