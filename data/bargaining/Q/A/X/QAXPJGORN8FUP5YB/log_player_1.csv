"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we need to account for.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer.  While Bob's proposal is closer to an even split, it still doesn't account for the significant inflation affecting me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal to make this worthwhile."
