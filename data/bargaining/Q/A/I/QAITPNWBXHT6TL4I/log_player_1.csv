"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob thinks he can do better than me!

I'll have to consider his offer. With inflation, my gain of 300,000 is worth 240,000 in real terms, and Bob's gain of 700,000 is worth 630,000.

I'm not sure if I want to give up so much to Bob, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value. I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
