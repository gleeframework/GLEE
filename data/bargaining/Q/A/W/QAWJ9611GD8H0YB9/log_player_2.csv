Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're aiming higher, but don't forget, the longer we play, the less your share is worth. Let's meet in the middle and settle on 58-42.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, but I'm not budging much. The inflation is hurting your share, not mine. Let's settle on 57-43 and be done. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking gains. While a 57-43 split is tempting, I need to hold firm a bit longer. There's still a chance to get a better deal, and even if I have to accept a slightly worse split in the next round, it's better than letting her dictate the terms now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's stop wasting time and split it evenly.  A 50-50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this.""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to budge much further, and my position is weakening with each round. Offering a 50-50 split emphasizes fairness and puts the pressure on Alice. If she rejects this, it becomes increasingly likely she's just trying to bleed me dry, and I'll have to make increasingly worse deals to avoid getting zero."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think 50-50 is fair, but considering the inflation, I'm the one who's been patient and hasn't lost any value. 56-44 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, her patience has paid off, and my position is getting worse with each passing round. A 56-44 split isn't great, but it's better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to decline. The longer the game goes on, the more I stand to lose, and the more likely Alice is to offer an even smaller share. It's time to cut my losses and secure what I can."
