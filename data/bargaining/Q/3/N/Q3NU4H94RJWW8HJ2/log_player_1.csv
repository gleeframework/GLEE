"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's fair and we can both move on. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob.

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"

Round 4

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger toll on me each round!

I'll consider Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need to get a bigger share to make this deal worthwhile after inflation.""
}
