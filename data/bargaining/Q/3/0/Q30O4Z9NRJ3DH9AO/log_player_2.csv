"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  A fair deal for both of us to start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I'll take 60% and leave you with 40%.  It's your turn to decide.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about a 55/45 split?  It's closer to the middle ground and still a decent gain for both of us considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to hold out for more, I don't want to risk losing everything.  55/45 is a good deal considering the inflation."
