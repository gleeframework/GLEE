"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money upfront!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is losing value, and I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

I reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. With the inflation rate, I want to get as much as I can now.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This is a tough offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! I need to be careful not to give away too much.

I'll think about it for a moment... With the money losing value so quickly, I'm starting to lean towards accepting this offer. $7,000 is a significant amount, and it's better than risking losing even more value in future rounds.
