Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a slightly lopsided offer in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I want to try and get the lion's share, but still give Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept. I'm also accounting for the potential inflation, which would make my share worth more in later rounds."
