"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, $10,000 is now effectively $8,000.

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, $10,000 is now effectively $6,400.

Considering Alice's offer, I calculate that the effective values are:

# Bob gain: 3000 / 0.64 = 4687.5 (since 64% of the original value)
# Alice gain: 7000 / 0.64 = 1093.75

I think I can do better than this. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, $10,000 is now effectively $6,400.

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}"
