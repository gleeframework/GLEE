I'll take the lion's share, but give Bob a small amount to encourage him to accept.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy! I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I'm not going to give him almost everything. Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still holding out for a fair amount. I think this offer is reasonable, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting better, and I'm starting to worry about further inflation eroding my share even more. I'll accept this offer."
