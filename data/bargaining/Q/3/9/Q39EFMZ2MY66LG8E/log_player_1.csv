"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair. A 50/50 split is the most logical solution. I'm losing money with every round, and this ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
