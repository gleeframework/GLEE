Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  While the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than in the first round, Alice's offer still represents a substantial gain for Bob compared to the potential outcome of further rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob has to make a counter-offer.  There's a risk that Alice might reject that counter-offer, and in subsequent rounds, the inflation could make Bob's potential gains even smaller. 
* **Fairness:**  The offer is a 50/50 split, which seems relatively fair, especially given the uncertainty of inflation and the possibility of Alice rejecting future proposals.

While Bob might hope for a bigger share, accepting this offer offers a reasonable and relatively secure outcome."
