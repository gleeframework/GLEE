"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront since the inflation hits me harder. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Your share is impacted by inflation more, let's be realistic.  I'll take a little less to end this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer is better for both of us than the last round. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. We both lose out if we keep going. A 50/50 split is the only fair option.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, a 50/50 split doesn't reflect the fact that I'm losing money faster. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

Alice is unlikely to offer anything better than this. While not ideal, accepting prevents losing the money altogether as the rounds progress.
