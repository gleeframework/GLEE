"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, given that I'm the first to propose.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is unacceptable.  While I'm willing to compromise, a 40/60 split is too far in his favor.  It's my turn to propose in the next round, and I'll try to find a more equitable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more balanced approach, given that Bob's previous offer was too lopsided. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything less than a 60/40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm running out of time, I'm still not willing to settle for a 45/55 split. It's still too heavily weighted in Bob's favor. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm raising my offer to 55/45,  which is more balanced than Bob's previous proposal. I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I won't go lower than this. Time is running out, and I need to secure a reasonable share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only 6 rounds remaining, the value of the money is rapidly declining.  Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is the most equitable so far, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's time to compromise and accept this offer."
