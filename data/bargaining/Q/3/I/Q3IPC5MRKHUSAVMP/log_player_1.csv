"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll take less to start.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I need to make sure I get a fair share. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a decent share.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take less, but still trying to get a decent share of the money."
