"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I get a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more fair split, considering the value of the money decreases with each round.  Let's get this over with!  
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing, so I'll aim for a higher share.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 2.
