"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a classic ultimatum game with the added twist of inflation working against me. While 60/40 seems unfair, I need to optimize for the long game.  Alice will likely be willing to negotiate to avoid getting $0."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. How about 45/55?""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but not too much:** I'm acknowledging Alice's desire for a bigger share by increasing my previous offer. However, the increase isn't drastic, signaling I'm not desperate and value my position.
* **Inflation factor:**  Delaying is risky for me.  Every round, the value of the money decreases. A 45/55 split now is better than a potentially better split later when the value has eroded.
* **Negotiation tone:**  The message is framed as a reasonable counter-proposal, aiming for a collaborative rather than adversarial tone. This might make Alice more receptive to accepting a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiation in her favor.  While she moved slightly from her initial 60/40, the inflation means this offer is worse for me than her first one. Accepting now would set a bad precedent and likely lead to even less favorable offers in future rounds. I need to show Alice that I'm willing to walk away from a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose if this fails. 48/52 is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased urgency:** With each round, the inflation eats further into my potential gains. Making my stance clear is crucial now. 
* **Firm but fair:**  This offer is still a compromise, acknowledging Alice's desire for a larger share while trying to secure a reasonable amount for myself.
* **Ultimatum:**  By stating ""final offer,"" I'm signaling to Alice that I'm serious and won't be pressured into accepting less favorable terms. This might push her to accept before the money dwindles further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about 57-43? 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut my losses. Alice is clearly playing hardball, and the relentless inflation is eroding my potential gains faster than I'd like.  

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While 43/57 isn't ideal, it's still better than getting $0 if we fail to agree.  The longer the game goes on, the worse any potential deal will be for me due to inflation.
* **Reading the Opponent:** Alice seems determined to get a larger share and might be willing to risk it all. Accepting now avoids a total loss. 
* **Preserving Value:**  Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now ensures I at least get something. Delaying further significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing."
