"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80 and you get 20. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 is a good starting point, Alice. We can work from there if you prefer. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of 50 is actually 40 dollars. 

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
