Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise and take 60% to keep things moving. Your share is still decent, especially considering inflation is hitting you less hard. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
