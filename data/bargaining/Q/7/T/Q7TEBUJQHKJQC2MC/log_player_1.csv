"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation impacts us differently. Let's settle this now! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to reverse the split! 

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I want to accept this offer, Bob. I think I can do better than a 40% share. The inflation is working in my favor, after all!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split now.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, taking into account the effects of inflation on the money we're dividing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's call it even. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think a 55/45 split is the best way to ensure we both get something worthwhile after inflation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to stick with the 55-45 split.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, Bob. I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining amount, considering the inflation is still working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. I think a 50-50 split is a fair way to end this, considering the inflation has taken a bigger toll on your share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise, given the effects of inflation on the money we're dividing."
