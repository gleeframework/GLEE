"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 10% for yourself, I'll get the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing that Bob gets $100,000 and I get the remaining $900,000. I'm making this offer because it's a relatively generous start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'm not thrilled about giving up 50% of the remaining amount, but Bob's message seems sincere, and it's a fair split. I'm not sure what the future holds, and I don't want to risk waiting for a potentially worse offer.

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
