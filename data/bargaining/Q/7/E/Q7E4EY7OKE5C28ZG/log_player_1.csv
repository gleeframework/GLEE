"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a decent share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking the majority, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less than before, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to do better in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
