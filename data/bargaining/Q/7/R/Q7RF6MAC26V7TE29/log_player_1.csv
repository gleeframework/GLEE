I'm starting with a relatively high offer for myself, aiming for a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I proposed in the first round.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  Bob's rejection of my previous offer shows he's willing to play the long game, but with inflation, I'm still in a strong position."
