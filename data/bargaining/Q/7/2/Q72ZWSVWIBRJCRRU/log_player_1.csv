"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to start with a fair split.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the 5% inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 95% of 40, which is 38. Since Bob's gain of 60 is still worth 100% of 60, it's a more favorable split for him.

I'll decide to reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth even less now. I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
