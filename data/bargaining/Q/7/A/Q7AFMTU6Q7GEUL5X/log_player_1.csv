I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving 100,000 to Bob.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm willing to lower my share to 800,000, giving Bob 200,000.  This is a fair offer given the inflation impacting Bob, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  I'm not giving up, but I need to be strategic to maximize my share given the inflation impacting him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share again to 700,000 and offering Bob 300,000. The inflation is starting to impact Bob heavily, and I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, even though he's being hit harder by inflation.  I'm still confident we can reach a better agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm dropping my share to 600,000 and offering Bob 400,000. We're running out of time, and with inflation hitting Bob hard, I believe this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, considering the extreme inflation affecting him. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially with so few rounds remaining."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only a few rounds left, and the inflation severely impacting Bob, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest and most likely way to reach an agreement.  Let's hope he sees it that way too."
