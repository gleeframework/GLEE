"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. I'm not sure if Bob is trying to take advantage of me, but I'll consider his offer.

I'll reject his offer for now and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I was hoping for a bit more. I'll counteroffer: 4200 for me, 5800 for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my money is now worth 40% of its original value, and Bob's offer would have given me only 32% of the original amount. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""My previous offer still stands. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a fair share.""
}
```

I'm sticking to my previous offer, hoping Bob will accept it or make a counteroffer."
