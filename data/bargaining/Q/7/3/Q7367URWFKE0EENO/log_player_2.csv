Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reflective of the risk I'm taking by letting the money depreciate. This way we both benefit from a quicker resolution.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome.  Let's not lose any more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
