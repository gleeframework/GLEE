"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money 3:2 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while also considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 6:4 split in my favor.  We can both still get a significant portion of the money, and the decreasing value makes this a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
