"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a high initial offer, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for him to accept, avoiding the risk of inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. Even with the inflation, taking 250,000 is less than 23% of my initial gain. I'm better off continuing to the next round and proposing my own offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob. This is still more than his offer in the previous round, and I'm hoping it's enough to convince him to accept. The inflation is starting to take effect, so I need to be more flexible, but I'm still aiming for a substantial portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse for me, especially considering the inflation. Even though my potential gains are significantly lower than the first round, I'm still aiming for a better deal. The inflation is hurting me more than Bob, so I need to push for a more favorable split.  I'll reject this offer and propose my own in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob. This is a significant concession, but I'm trying to find a balance between securing a decent share of the money and avoiding further rounds of inflation.  Bob is clearly aiming for a larger share, but with each round, inflation hurts me more than it hurts him.  I'm hoping this offer is compelling enough to convince him to accept."
