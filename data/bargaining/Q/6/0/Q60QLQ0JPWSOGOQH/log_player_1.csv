"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 700k and you'll get 300k. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me taking the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time. I'll take 600k, and you get 400k.  This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as keen on giving up as much as I was in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving up 400k. Can you offer something a bit more generous?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with an even better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. 55% for me and 45% for you. Is this more to your liking?""
}
```"
