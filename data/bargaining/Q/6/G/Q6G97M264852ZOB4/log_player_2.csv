Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn again, let's try to meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting worse, it's still early in the game. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage, but accepting a 40/60 split this early would set a bad precedent for future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice. Let's be fair. 50/50.  The inflation is hurting me, and this will save us both time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have thought of that before, I'm not going 50/50 now 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to pressure me. However, with 5 rounds left, accepting a 38/62 split is too risky. I need to show firmness, otherwise she'll keep pushing for a worse deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit on the inflation. Accept this now, or we both lose out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  The situation is getting critical. I need to show some flexibility, but still aim for a reasonable deal.  52/48 is generous considering the inflation, and the strong message might push Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can afford to wait, can you? 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is getting very dangerous. However, accepting a 35/65 split would be disastrous in the long run. Alice is clearly banking on my fear of inflation. I need to hold my nerve for one more round, at least."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. Take it or leave it.  The inflation is killing me, and you're getting a great deal!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Time is almost up. I need to make a final offer that seems both desperate and reasonable.  45/55 is still in Alice's favor, but the strong language might be enough to push her to accept before we both lose everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm not 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's painful, but I have to cut my losses.  With only one round left, Alice is clearly willing to run the clock. Accepting 30/70 is awful, but it's better than nothing, which is what I'll get if I reject and we reach round 12."
