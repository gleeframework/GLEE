"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation risk.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate and the value of the money will decrease over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 4k is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of 4,000 for myself. I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 7k is a fairer share considering the inflation risk.""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $10,000 and Bob gets 30%. I'm trying to find a balance between my initial offer and Bob's offer, while taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 to mitigate the inflation risk 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation risk. With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm willing to accept a more even split to ensure we both get a decent share."
