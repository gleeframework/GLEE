"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you 10% and keep 90%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger share this round.  I'll give you 40% of the money, but consider the inflation! This is a much better deal for you than last round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $320,000. While Bob's offer is indeed a better deal than my initial one, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to maximize my share while taking into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this round, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Consider this a compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
