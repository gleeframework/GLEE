"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you 10% and keep 90% 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob!  While it's fair on the surface, the inflation is a huge factor.  Bob needs to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger share this round.  I'll give you 40% of the money, but consider the inflation! This is a much better deal for you than last round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share this round, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Consider this a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the initial offer was enticing, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money Bob would gain.  It's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting even less in the next round."
