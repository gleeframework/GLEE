"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000, and I'll take the remaining 600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get 300,000, which is a smaller share than I initially proposed. On the other hand, if I reject and proceed to Round 3, the money will be worth 10% less for me and 10% less for Bob.

I decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll aim for a slightly larger share. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000, and I'll take the remaining 550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob's offer is identical to my previous offer, but with the money being worth less due to inflation. Since the money is worth 14.26% less for Bob, his share is actually smaller than before. I'll take this opportunity to get a better deal.
