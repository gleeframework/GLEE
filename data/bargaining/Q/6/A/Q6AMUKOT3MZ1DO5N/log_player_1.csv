"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can discuss later""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is 20$. I'm keeping 80% for myself, which is 80$. The message is a friendly way to start the negotiation, suggesting we can discuss further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think 20 is too low for me 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 70 * 0.9 = 63
Bob gain: 30 * 0.9 = 27

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I was hoping for a more generous offer from Bob. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 70 * 0.9 = 63
Bob gain: 30 * 0.9 = 27

Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, 40% of the remaining value, which is 40$. I'm keeping 60% for myself, which is 60$. The message is a friendly way to suggest a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think 40 is a bit low for me, so I'll give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

Initial $100 * 0.727 = $72.7
Alice gain: 55 * 0.727 = 39.945
Bob gain: 45 * 0.727 = 32.715

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I was hoping for a more generous offer from Bob. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

Initial $100 * 0.727 = $72.7
Alice gain: 55 * 0.727 = 39.945
Bob gain: 45 * 0.727 = 32.715

Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet you halfway, no more negotiations""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a larger share, 55% of the remaining value, which is 55$. I'm keeping 45% for myself, which is 45$. The message is a firm suggestion to meet in the middle and end the negotiations."
