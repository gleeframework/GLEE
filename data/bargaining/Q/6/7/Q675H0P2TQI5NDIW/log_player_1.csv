"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to be greedy and try to get most of the money in the first round. This is a risky strategy, but it might pay off if Bob is willing to take a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a lot better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better deal for myself. Since I'm the one making the offer in the next round, I can try to secure a larger share of the remaining money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a significant amount of money for Bob, and it's a fairer deal than his previous offer. I'm hoping he'll accept it rather than risk losing even more money in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. It's a lot less than I initially wanted, but the inflation is really hitting hard. It's better to take what I can get now rather than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
