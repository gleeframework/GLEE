"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 exactly in half, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to keep more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, his gain of $6,000 is equivalent to $5,700 in the first round. I'm not sure if I want to accept a deal that's still biased towards Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was still biased towards him, I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive. I'll offer to take a slightly larger share, but still be reasonable.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair deal!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this new offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to keep more, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round, considering the inflation. Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth $5,500 / 0.854 (1 - 0.145) = $6,457.35 in the first round. This is still a relatively high offer from Bob.

However, considering the inflation, I'll think about accepting this offer.
