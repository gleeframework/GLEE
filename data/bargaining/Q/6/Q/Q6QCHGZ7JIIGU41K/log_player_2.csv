"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split fairly reflects the fact that we both lose money as time goes on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, and only 5% less for Alice, I have more to lose by prolonging the game. However, accepting an offer of $4000 out of $10,000 right away seems too low, given that the decrease in value for me is twice that for Alice. I'll reject this offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round, despite the risk of the money being worth less."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n### Assistant: {""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation hits me harder, I think this is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given the asymmetrical impact of inflation, where I lose 10% of the value each round and Alice loses 5%, I've decided to propose a division that slightly favors me. By offering $5500 for myself and $4500 for Alice, I'm attempting to compensate for the greater loss in value I incur with each passing round. This offer also serves as a counter to Alice's initial proposal, aiming to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a negotiation, and we both need to compromise.  I've adjusted my offer slightly, but we need to reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","### Assistant: {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the money's value is decreasing for both of us, the rate at which it decreases is still higher for me (19% less value now) compared to Alice (9.75% less value now). Alice's new offer of $4200 for me and $5800 for herself is only a slight adjustment from her initial offer and does not sufficiently account for the accelerated loss of value I'm experiencing. Given this, and considering the principle of trying to find a more balanced agreement, I will reject this offer. The decrease in value due to inflation makes each round more costly for me, but accepting an offer that doesn't adequately reflect this imbalance seems premature. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a more favorable split despite the diminishing value of the money."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Assistant: {""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Given the increasing loss from inflation, I'm trying to meet you halfway while considering the impact on both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: At this stage, the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced, with my potential gain worth 19% less and Alice's potential gain worth 9.75% less than the initial value. To expedite the negotiation and account for the differential impact of inflation, I'm revising my offer to $5200 for myself and $4800 for Alice. This adjustment aims to demonstrate a willingness to compromise and reach a mutually acceptable agreement before the value of the money drops further. By slightly reducing my share from the previous offer, I'm signaling flexibility while still trying to mitigate the disproportionate effect of inflation on my gain."
