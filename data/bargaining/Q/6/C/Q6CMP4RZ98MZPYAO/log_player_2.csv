"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. Let's be reasonable, this is a better deal for both of us considering the inflation.""}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Leveraging Inflation:** Alice loses value faster than Bob with each round.  Delaying plays to Bob's advantage.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  A slight majority for Bob seems ""fair"" on the surface, making Alice more likely to consider it.
* **Time Pressure:**  The message implies that further delays will just hurt them both, encouraging Alice to accept now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While her offer is closer to the middle ground, she's still aiming for a larger share. By rejecting this offer, Bob increases the pressure on Alice to make a more substantial concession in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer - let's end this now before we both lose more.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:** Alice is now facing a significant devaluation of her potential winnings. 
* **Finality:** By calling this a ""final offer,"" Bob creates a sense of urgency and implies he's unwilling to negotiate further. 
* **Slight Concession:**  The offer is slightly better for Alice than Bob's previous proposal, making it appear as a concession and increasing the chances of acceptance."
