"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider the proposal and start negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a decent amount and don't have to worry about inflation eating into our share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56
* Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250

I'd rather have the higher amount, so I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, taking into account the effects of inflation."
