"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob!""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you less, but I think this is a fair deal for me! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd rather not give up too much ground early on. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.
