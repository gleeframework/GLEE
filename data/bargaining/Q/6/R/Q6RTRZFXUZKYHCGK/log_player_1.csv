Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each round, our options dwindle.  This offer is my final attempt to find a solution that keeps us both from losing everything.  I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need a larger portion to protect myself from the rapidly increasing inflation. Please reconsider.

{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Bob. You're asking for the same deal I offered you in the first round! Let's be realistic, or we both lose."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. He's hoping that as the rounds progress, you'll become more desperate and accept a worse deal. It's important to stay firm and make it clear that you're not going to accept an unfair split.  Time is running out, but letting Bob bully you into a bad deal is worse."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a deal where we both get almost half. Accept this or let's both walk away with nothing because I'm done playing games.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running extremely short. Bob needs to understand that you're serious about getting a fair deal. This offer is a significant concession on your part and should be presented as a final offer. This leaves Bob with a choice: get a pretty good deal, or walk away with nothing because of his stubbornness."
