700000.0,300000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to settle due to the higher inflation you face.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to offset the faster inflation I face. Let's try a 60/40 split. It's fair considering the circumstances.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the compromise, Bob, the proposed split heavily favors you.  Let's find a more equitable solution in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This offer still gives you a significant share while acknowledging the impact of inflation on both our ends. Time is ticking!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, we need to find a solution quickly.  This offer acknowledges your concerns about inflation, but it's also essential I secure a substantial share to minimize my losses.  Let's aim for a compromise that benefits us both.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, while I understand your point, this offer is the same as my last one, just flipped.  We need to find a truly middle ground here, and quickly, or we both lose.",Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, let's stop mirroring each other and agree on a true compromise.  This offer still gives you a significant portion and avoids the risk of us both walking away with nothing.  What do you say?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, with each round, our options dwindle.  This offer is my final attempt to find a solution that keeps us both from losing everything.  I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need a larger portion to protect myself from the rapidly increasing inflation. Please reconsider.",Bob,6,
,,"This is getting ridiculous, Bob. You're asking for the same deal I offered you in the first round! Let's be realistic, or we both lose.",Alice,6,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a deal where we both get almost half. Accept this or let's both walk away with nothing because I'm done playing games.",Alice,7,
