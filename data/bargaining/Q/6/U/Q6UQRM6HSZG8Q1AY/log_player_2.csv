**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining and the value of the money decreasing rapidly, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Waiting for a better offer in later rounds might yield marginally more, but the impact of inflation will erode most of any potential gains.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share. It's unlikely she'll agree to anything significantly better than this offer as time runs out.

Accepting this offer secures a reasonable sum, even with the impact of inflation.  Refusing it at this stage is a gamble that could easily backfire."
