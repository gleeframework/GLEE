"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $9,000 and you can have $1,000. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants a bit more this time.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $3,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer. On the other hand, if I reject and proceed to the next round, the money will be worth even less.

After considering the options, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take $7,500 and you can have $2,500. Let's make a deal?""

# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I still want more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is pushing for a larger share.

Considering the inflation rate, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer.

If I accept, I'll get $4,000, which is a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. On the other hand, if I reject and proceed to the next round, the money will be worth even less.

Considering the inflation rate, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth even less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

If I accept, I'll get $4,500, which is a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. On the other hand, if I reject and proceed to the next round, the money will be worth even less.
