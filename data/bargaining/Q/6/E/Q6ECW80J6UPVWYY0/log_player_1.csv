"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, so I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering to take 45 dollars and leave 55 dollars for Bob."
