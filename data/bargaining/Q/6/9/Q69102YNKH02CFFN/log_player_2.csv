"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get something too! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split, and the penalty for waiting isn't that bad for me in the early rounds. Alice's perception of value will decrease faster than mine, so I'm hoping for a better offer later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That offer was too low, Alice. How about we try something more equitable?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than that to make it worth my while. Let's split it 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting closer, but it's still not a good deal for me.  The inflation is starting to hurt her more, so I'll hold out for a bit longer and see if she's willing to go closer to 50/50."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This seems like a fair split, considering we're both losing money as we go.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a little more than that. Let's split it 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is as close to even as I think we're going to get.  The longer I wait, the less her offers will be worth to her, and she might start lowballing me again. It's better to take a slightly less even split now than risk getting even less later."
