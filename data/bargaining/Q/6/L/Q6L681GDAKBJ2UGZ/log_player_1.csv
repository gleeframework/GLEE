"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, I'm sure we can both agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think splitting it evenly is a good idea, considering the difference in inflation rates. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit less, but it's still a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but I think we both need to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly due to inflation. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $4,000 is better than nothing, and it's a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of money."
