"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a very lopsided offer! I'd rather not accept it. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is a bit more balanced than my previous one, but I'm still trying to get a good deal."
