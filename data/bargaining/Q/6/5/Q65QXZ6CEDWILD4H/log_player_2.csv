"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, it's important to consider the inflation rates.  A rejection will give Bob the chance to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. This split gives you a decent share while taking into account the inflation affecting both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer still gives me a bit of an edge considering the rapid inflation I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a higher share, considering the rapid inflation impacting Alice, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice.  It's a decent split that ensures both of us get something, and rejecting could lead to a less favorable outcome with each passing round."
