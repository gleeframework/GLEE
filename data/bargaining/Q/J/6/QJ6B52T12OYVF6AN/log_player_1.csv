"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll consider the effective gain as 400,000 * (100% / 80%) = 500,000.

I'll also consider the effective gain for Bob as 600,000 * (100% / 90%) = 666,666.67.

My gain is less than Bob's gain, and the difference is significant. I'll decide to reject this offer.

# Bob gain: 700000

I'll also consider the effective gain for Bob as 700,000 * (100% / 73.1%) = 956,512.15.
