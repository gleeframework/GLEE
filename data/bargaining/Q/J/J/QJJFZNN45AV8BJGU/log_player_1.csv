Round 35
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Alice seems to be stuck in a pattern of offering a little less than what Bob offered in the previous round. This strategy isn't going to work.  Bob is likely using a similar strategy, and they'll just keep rejecting each other's offers. 

To win, Alice needs to either:

* **Break the pattern:** Offer a significantly different amount than what Bob has been offering.  Perhaps a more even split, or a very small amount for herself. 
* **Realize the game's logic:** Both players are likely trying to maximize their own gains, but there's a limit to how much they can get. In this scenario, the best outcome is to split the money evenly, but both players are being greedy.

Let's try a different strategy. How about Alice offers a more even split?
