"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can work out a better deal in the following rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's not a good deal for Bob.  Even though it's a small amount, it's better to hold out and see if Alice will offer more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  This is a fair starting point, and we can adjust in later rounds if needed.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more.  Let's split it 60/40 this time.  We need to come to an agreement soon or we'll both lose money! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's better to keep rejecting for now.  Alice's offer is still not very good, and with each round, her offer will have to get better to account for the inflation affecting Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to offer 60% to you, Alice, but I need to get a better deal than what you've been offering. Let's work together to find a compromise.""
