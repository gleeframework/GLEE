"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be fair, a 50/50 split seems reasonable considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I want to try to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and 40% less than the original value, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll also keep in mind that Bob is not affected by inflation.\n\n###\n\nHere's my new proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 4800,""bob_gain"": 5200,""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more.
