"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start, we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me as the starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to keep a slight edge. Consider this a starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of the original value, so it's equivalent to $4750.

I'll consider Bob's offer. It's a 50-50 split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 90.25% of the original value (95% * 0.95). I'll aim to get a bit more than half.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to keep a slight edge. Let's see if you can do better than this.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I can do better than this. You're getting a bit too close to the lower end. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4500 is now worth 85.74% of the original value (100% - 14.26%).

I'll consider Bob's offer. It's a 45-55 split, which is a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4800 is now worth 76.38% of the original value (100% - 22.62%). I'll consider Bob's offer. It's a 48-52 split, which is still a bit skewed towards Bob's favor, but I'm getting closer to the middle.

I'll accept this offer.
