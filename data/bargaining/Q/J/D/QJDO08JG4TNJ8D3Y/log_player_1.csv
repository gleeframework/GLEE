"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. This is a pretty generous offer considering the inflation risk. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in taking this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy, and I'm not willing to accept such a bad deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but I'm still offering Bob a fair amount. It's in his best interest to accept this offer."
