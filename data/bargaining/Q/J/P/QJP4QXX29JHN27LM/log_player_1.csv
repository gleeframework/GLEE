Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This seems like a fair starting point, giving Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation factor is significant. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least $4,000, which is better than risking getting nothing if I reject and he does the same in the next round."
