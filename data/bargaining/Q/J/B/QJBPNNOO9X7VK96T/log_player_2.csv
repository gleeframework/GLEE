**Reasoning:**

The longer the game goes on, the more Bob loses due to the higher inflation rate affecting his potential earnings. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's ideal outcome happened in Round 1. Each round sees a significant drop in the value of his potential gain.  
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows Bob is facing higher inflation. Her offers are likely to get worse, not better.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better offer in the next round or two isn't worth the risk of a much worse offer later, or even reaching a point where any potential gain is negligible due to inflation. 

**It's a tough decision, but at this point, taking Alice's offer cuts Bob's losses and guarantees him a reasonable sum.**"
