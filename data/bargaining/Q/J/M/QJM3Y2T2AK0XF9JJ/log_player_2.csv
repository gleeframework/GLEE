Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, let's meet closer to my original offer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, time is running out. I'll meet you a bit closer, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but time is working against me more than her.  While her offer is slightly better, accepting now would mean losing over a third of the potential value due to inflation. It's worth risking another round to try and get closer to a 50/50 split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We're at the point where inflation is significantly hurting my share.  This is my final offer - it's fair and gives us both a good amount.  Accept this, or we both lose out.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm not willing to give up my advantage. This is my counteroffer 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the risk of getting nothing is too high now. Alice is clearly holding out for a larger share, and with each round, my position weakens significantly due to inflation. Accepting this offer still gives me a significant sum, even if it's less than ideal. It's better to take a smaller share than risk losing everything in the remaining rounds."
