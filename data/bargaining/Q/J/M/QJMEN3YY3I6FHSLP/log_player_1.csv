"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slightly bigger share""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'll take more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share, but I'll still give you a decent amount""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal is getting closer to being reasonable! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more cautious. However, a 50/50 split is a decent compromise.

I'll decide to accept this offer. It's not the best deal for me, but it's a fair one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
