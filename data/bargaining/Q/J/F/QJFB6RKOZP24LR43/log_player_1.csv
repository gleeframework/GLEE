"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since we have 12 rounds, and I'm confident I can get a better deal later, I'm giving Bob a small amount to entice him to accept.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not going to let him! I'll hold out for a better deal.  This offer is way too low.  It's time for me to counter."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 80/20, but Bob is still getting a good deal.  This offer is in line with my original strategy, and I'm confident that with the added pressure of inflation, he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to be greedy, but I'm not going to give in. His offer is even lower than my last one, and inflation is biting into my potential gains. I'm going to keep fighting for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still offering a good deal to Bob.  The pressure of inflation is building, and I need to make sure I secure at least some of the money. I'm hoping he'll see that this is the best deal he'll get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and inflation is making this deal a lot less attractive.  I'm sticking to my original strategy of getting a better deal later. I'm sure I can get a more equitable split in the next few rounds!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of lowering my offer gradually, hoping to find a sweet spot where Bob will accept.  The pressure of inflation is mounting, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement before the money becomes worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not reflecting the reality of inflation, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low share.  He's trying to take advantage of the situation, but I'm determined to get a fairer deal.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only a few rounds left, the pressure of inflation is immense.  It's clear that we need to reach a compromise to avoid losing everything. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like the fairest way to divide the remaining value. Hopefully, Bob will recognize the urgency of the situation and agree to this offer."
