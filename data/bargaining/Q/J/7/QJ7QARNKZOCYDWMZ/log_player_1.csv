"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to take $700,000 and leave $300,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll decide whether to accept or reject the offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll get. If I accept, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 90% of $700,000 (10% less than the original amount). If I reject and proceed, the money will be worth 81% of the original amount in the next round.

Considering the offer, I'll reject it. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is 2/3, which is not as favorable as I'd like. I'll try to negotiate for a better ratio.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 81% of the original amount, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000 and leave $450,000 for Bob."
