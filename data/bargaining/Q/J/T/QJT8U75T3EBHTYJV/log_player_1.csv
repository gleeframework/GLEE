Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a very uneven split. I think this will encourage Bob to accept it in the first round.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm not going to accept such an unfair offer! It's my turn now, and I'll propose a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

This time, I'm offering an even split.  It's fair, and it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement."
