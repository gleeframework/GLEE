"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a relatively equal split, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering we both lose value over time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is fair. I'm losing 20% of my potential gain, and he's only losing 5%. I think I should get a larger share considering the inflation rate. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and split it 50/50, considering the inflation rate""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."
