Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the time pressure and the inflation. While the offer isn't terrible, I still believe I can get a better deal.  It's getting risky, but holding out a bit longer might make her panic and offer more favorable terms."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you're right.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's getting too risky now.  Continuing to push for an advantage might result in Alice playing hardball and ultimately leaving us both with nothing.  A 50/50 split, even with the inflation, is better than nothing."
