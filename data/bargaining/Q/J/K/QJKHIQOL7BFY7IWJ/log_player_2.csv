Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer in the first round was already generous considering the inflation. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I need a larger share to account for the decreasing value. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
