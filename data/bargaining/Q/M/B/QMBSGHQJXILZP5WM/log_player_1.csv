"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2,500. I believe this is fair considering the risk of inflation and the differing rates at which the money will be worth for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 3:2 ratio, considering the inflation rates and the risk involved. This way, we both get a decent share, and the game is fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
