"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's work together! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully...

I accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 45-55 split is a more even split, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to accept it and end the game."
