"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script - I'll take 60, you take 40. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too worried about the inflation. However, I was hoping to get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll propose a 55-45 split, hoping to get a bit more.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway - 55-45, a compromise!""}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
