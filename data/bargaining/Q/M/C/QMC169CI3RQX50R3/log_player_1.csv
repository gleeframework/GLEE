Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm compromising.  This is my final offer. It accounts for the time pressure and gives you a slight edge. Let's be done with this.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob is unlikely to offer anything better at this point.  The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation hurts him, making any deal where I get more than 50 increasingly unlikely.  It's better to secure a reasonable win now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
