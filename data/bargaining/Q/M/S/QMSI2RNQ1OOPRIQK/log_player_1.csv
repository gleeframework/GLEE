"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is a relatively fair split, and I'll take 55 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given your 5% inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

""alice_gain"": 51,
""bob_gain"": 49,
""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""
}

I'm taking into account the 5% inflation rate that affects my gain, and I'm trying to find a compromise that is closer to the middle, while still considering the loss of value for me. I hope Bob will accept this offer."
