"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's split it 60-40!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I was initially offered 60, and now Bob is offering me 20. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, let's try 45-55!""}

I'm reducing my initial demand to 45% and increasing Bob's share to 55%. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not giving up control entirely! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about the 30% share, but I'll think about it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not happy about it. I was hoping for a better share, but I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation."
