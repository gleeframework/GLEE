Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is really eating into your share now. This is a good deal, don't pass it up. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a higher share, the inflation is becoming a serious problem. Accepting this offer at least guarantees me some return, even if it's significantly less than what I initially aimed for."
