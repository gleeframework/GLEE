"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair division.  Let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob!  While getting something is better than nothing, Alice's idea of ""fair"" is laughable. Bob has time to negotiate a much better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a much fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal than that. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is still heavily skewed in Alice's favor.  While the impact of inflation is becoming apparent for Alice, Bob has time on his side and can afford to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. This offer is fair and prevents us both from losing money to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get nervous about inflation.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the best deal Bob is likely to get.  While not ideal, a 50/50 split is objectively fair, and waiting any longer risks Alice panicking and offering a drastically lower amount due to the impact of inflation on her share."
