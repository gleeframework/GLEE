"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the $100. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a generous offer, but you might regret it if you don't take it! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. He's offering me $40, which is worth 90% of $50, but I'm not sure if that's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which gives me a slightly larger share than Bob's previous offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
