"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I need to adjust my calculations accordingly. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $50, which is 50% of the current value of $100.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
