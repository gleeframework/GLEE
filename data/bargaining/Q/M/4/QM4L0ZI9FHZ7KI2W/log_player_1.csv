"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $100 with an 80/20 split in favor of you, Bob. This aims to balance fairness while accounting for the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise with a 50/50 split, considering the value of the money will decrease in future rounds. This way, we both get an equal share and can move forward with a fair outcome. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
