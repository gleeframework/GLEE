"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10. You get $100,000, I get $900,000. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and I'll take the remaining $900,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's too low and we can negotiate further."
