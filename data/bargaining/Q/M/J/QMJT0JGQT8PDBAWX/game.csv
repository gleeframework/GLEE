4500.0,5500.0,Your offer was a bit imbalanced.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This accounts for the time value of the money - it's better for you to take a slightly smaller amount now than risk further devaluation in the next round.,Bob,2,

5200.0,4800.0,"Okay, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to come down to a 52/48 split in my favor. It's still a slight advantage for me, but it reflects the risk of further devaluation and should be fair for both of us.",Alice,3,
