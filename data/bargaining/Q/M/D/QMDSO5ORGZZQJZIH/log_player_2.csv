I'll reject this offer. While it's fair now, the money will be worth less to Alice in the next round.  I can try to get a better deal for myself."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share now, but it'll be worth more to you in the next round since the money loses value for you faster. Let's make a deal!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a little, but I still need a decent share. This offer is fair considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While it's better than the previous round, I can still try to get a better deal for myself in the next round, especially as the money is not losing any value for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm offering you a bit less this time, but remember, the money will be worth less to you in the next round. It's in your best interest to take this deal and avoid further inflation losses.""}
