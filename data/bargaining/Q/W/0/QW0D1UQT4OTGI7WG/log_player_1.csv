"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with 80, I'll give you a bit less this time! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $30 is actually equivalent to $28.75 in the first round's value.

I don't think this offer is significantly better than my initial offer, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting 45% and Bob getting 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to the middle, but still not there 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, my gain of $40 is actually equivalent to $34.51 in the first round's value.

I'm getting closer to the middle, but I still think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Final offer, let's meet exactly in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is the most balanced and fair division of the $100."
