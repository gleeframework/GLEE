"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 10% of the money, is it a good start?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount. I'm keeping the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 50/50, let's split it evenly! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds like a reasonable proposal. I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
