Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I propose a 52.5% / 47.5% split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point considering the inflation rates we're dealing with.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your last offer wasn't reasonable considering the inflation rates. To be fair to both of us, I propose a 50/50 split. This ensures we both walk away with a significant amount and avoids further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
