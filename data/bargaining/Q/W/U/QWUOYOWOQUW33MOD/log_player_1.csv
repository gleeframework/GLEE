Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to take a slight hit to the initial value, but I believe this is a more balanced split, considering the inflation rate.  Let's work together to get the most out of this. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
