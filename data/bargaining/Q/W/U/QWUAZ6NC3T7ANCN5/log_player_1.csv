"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 4:1 ratio, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth $7,200.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not too thrilled about a 50/50 split, especially since I think I should get more given the initial amount of $10,000. However, I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so my gain is now $6,480 (10% of $7,200 is $720, so $7,200 - $720 = $6,480).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take this and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a 3:2 ratio, which I think is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I still think a closer split is fair. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really kicking in now!

My gain in the first round was $8,000, and 27.1% of that is $2,168. So, my gain is now worth $5,832 ($8,000 - $2,168).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more money, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do better than a 45:55 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the previous round, so my gain is now $4,236 (10% of $5,832 is $584.2, and 17.1% of $5,832 is $998.5, so $5,832 - $998.5 = $4,833.5, rounded to $4,236).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a fair share. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. This is a 1.08:1 ratio, which I think is a reasonable compromise."
