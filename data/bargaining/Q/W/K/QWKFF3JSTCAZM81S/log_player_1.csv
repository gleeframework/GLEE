"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to give you 20 dollars and take 80 dollars for myself. It's a pretty generous offer, considering we're just starting out and I want to set a good tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to accept a low offer as I was in the first round. I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40 dollars, which is a slightly higher amount than before, but still a reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value of money."
