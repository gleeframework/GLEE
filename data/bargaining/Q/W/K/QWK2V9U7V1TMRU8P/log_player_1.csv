I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to see how Bob responds. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can both get a decent amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is a serious factor.  My offer was rejected, and Bob's counteroffer is a 50/50 split.  It's not ideal, but considering the inflation, it's likely the best I can get.  I'll accept the offer and secure at least half the money."
