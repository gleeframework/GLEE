"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3000 / 0.9 = 3333.33
* Bob gain: 7000 / 0.9 = 7777.78

I accept this offer.
