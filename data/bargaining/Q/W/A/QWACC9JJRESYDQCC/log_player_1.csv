"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, I'll give you a fair deal too! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, he's actually offering me $5,000 and himself $5,000, which is a 50-50 split. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
