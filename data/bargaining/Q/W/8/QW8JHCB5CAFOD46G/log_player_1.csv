I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. I'm hoping he'll accept, as I'm starting with a fairly generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
``` 

I'm proposing to keep $7,200 and give Bob $2,800.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I need to account for the inflation. Hopefully, this is enough to convince Bob to accept before we go through another round."
