"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice rejected my offer, it's my turn to make a new one. Here's my proposal for Round 2:

{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll get as follows:

Bob gain: 50 * 0.64 = 32
Alice gain: 50 * 0.64 = 32

The offer is now 50/50, which is a fair split. I'll accept Alice's offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
