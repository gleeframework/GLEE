"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000 and take $6,000 for myself.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is 60/40 in my favor.  This is a better deal for both of us, considering the inflation we'll face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather get more now than less later. I accept the offer.
