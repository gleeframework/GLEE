Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but the value decreases rapidly for you.  Let's be reasonable: 70/30 ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70
