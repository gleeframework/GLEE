"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, my friend!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60-40, which is a pretty standard and fair split in my opinion. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation risk. Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Considering the offer, I'm not sure if 45 is a good deal for me, especially since I don't know how much the inflation affects Bob's gain. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate still at 20%, my gain will be worth even less than in the previous round. I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which might be a more reasonable offer considering the inflation risk."
