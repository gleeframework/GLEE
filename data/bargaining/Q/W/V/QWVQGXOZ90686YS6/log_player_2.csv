This is a tough decision, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money keeps shrinking for me with each round. Waiting any longer means I'll get even less. 
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly holding out for a better deal, knowing my position weakens each round.  
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** 3000 is a lot less than I'd like, but it's better than holding out, getting a worse offer, and potentially ending up with nothing."
