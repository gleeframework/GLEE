# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take my chances for a better offer in the next round. The inflation isn't too bad yet."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my share again, but you need to be realistic.  Inflation is hurting you! 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think I'll take this offer. The inflation is really starting to hurt my potential gain, and I don't think I can get a much better offer at this point. Better to take the 52 now than risk losing more value in future rounds."
