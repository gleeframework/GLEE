"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to respond!""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but still a significant one, to see if he's willing to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 60% of the total amount, even with inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's aggressive offer in the previous round, I'll aim for a more conservative split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a balance, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

This way, I'm still giving Bob a significant share, but keeping a bit more for myself to account for the ongoing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you're getting lowballing me! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering the offer, I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

With inflation, my gain is worth only 48.8% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's offer is still quite aggressive. I'd like to see a more reasonable split, especially since the money is worth less and less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll aim for an even more conservative split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more for myself!""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share than I had initially, but still trying to protect my own interests in the face of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a firmer stance, meet me at this number or walk away! 
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With my gain now worth only 32.77% of what it was in the first round, I'll have to be very cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is extremely aggressive, and I'm not willing to give up a significant majority of the remaining value. I'd rather wait for a more reasonable offer, even if it means risking the game ending with a smaller gain for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a very cautious offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, this is my final offer!""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob almost the entire remaining amount, but I'm trying to salvage what's left for myself. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be left with a very small share of the original $10,000."
