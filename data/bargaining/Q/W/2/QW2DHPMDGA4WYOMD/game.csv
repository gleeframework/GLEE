60.0,40.0,Let's split the money. I believe a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation we are facing.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,"Considering the inflation, I'm willing to offer you a larger share to make up for the loss in value. Let's settle on 55 for you and 45 for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing rapidly. I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this fairly before it's too late.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"As the value continues to decrease for you, I'm willing to offer a 55/45 split. This way, we both get a significant share, but it reflects the changing value of the money for you.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
40.0,60.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a 40/60 split in your favor just to get something out of this deal before the money is worth nothing to me!",Alice,5,
