"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. Your turn!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. It's a better deal for both of us in the long run, as the money is worth less with each passing round. Let's be smart about this! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I think I'll take a closer look at Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $6,000 is still a good chunk of change. However, considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer of $5,500 is actually a better deal for me in terms of purchasing power.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
