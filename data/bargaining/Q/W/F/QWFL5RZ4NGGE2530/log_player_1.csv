"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to his benefit!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $400,000 is a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's enough considering Bob's gain is still 50% more than mine.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again! Since Bob's offer was a bit too skewed in his favor, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly larger share for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can finally reach a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve more for my efforts 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to his benefit again!

Considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $300,000 is a significant decrease from my previous offers. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up more than 30% of the total amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again! Since Bob's offer was even more skewed in his favor, I'll try to make an even more aggressive offer to counterbalance the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm trying to take back some ground and make the split more even, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit desperate, but I'm not going to let him take advantage of me!

Considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $200,000 is a very low offer, especially considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially when Bob is getting a whopping 80% of the total amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again! Since Bob's offer was extremely one-sided, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counterbalance the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob! Meet me at the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to take back even more ground and make the split more even, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. This offer is a bit more aggressive than my previous ones, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it!"
