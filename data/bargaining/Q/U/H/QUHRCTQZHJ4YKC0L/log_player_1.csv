"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I think it's very unfair that I would only get $250,000, while Bob would get $750,000. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and make a new one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 375000, ""bob_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 1/4 of the total""}

I'm proposing a 37.5/62.5 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still gives me a slightly larger share. I hope Bob will consider this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really not happy with this offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is still very one-sided in Bob's favor. I think I deserve more than $200,000, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me such a small share. I'll reject this offer and make a new one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and accept it, but I'm still holding out for a more balanced split."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. I'm already getting a very small share of the pie, and this offer is even worse than the previous ones. I think I deserve more than $100,000, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me such a tiny share. I'll reject this offer and try to make a new one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and accept it, but I'm not sure if it's the final offer I'll make."
