"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob will get $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's work together to find a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain of $4,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3,800.

I'll reject this offer because I was hoping to get a larger share, considering the initial proposal was 80/20. A 60/40 split doesn't seem as favorable to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45""
}
```

This way, I'll get $5,500, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but still a compromise."
