"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. I propose a 55/45 split.  This is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'm not thrilled with the 45% share, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer to avoid further rounds and potential even lower gains due to inflation.
