"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation effect, I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'd rather not take a smaller share. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round either.

I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
