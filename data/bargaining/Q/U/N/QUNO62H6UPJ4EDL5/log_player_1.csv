"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, I'll get the majority and you can get a decent share""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, where I get the majority of the money and Bob gets a decent share."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller majority, but you'll still get a decent share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 40-60 split. I was hoping for a better deal, considering I'm getting a smaller share of the money due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I still need to get a decent chunk of the money""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to give Bob a slightly better deal while still keeping a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping you'll accept this one 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, and my share is getting smaller and smaller. Bob's offer of 45-55 is actually a decent one, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept this offer and hope that Bob will keep his word and stick to the deal."
