"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a more equitable way to divide the money. It's still a fair deal for you, Alice, and it's closer to a true 50/50 split considering the inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
