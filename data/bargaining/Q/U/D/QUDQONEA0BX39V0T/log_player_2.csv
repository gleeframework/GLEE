Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation risk and our previous offers, I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Bob. This maintains a balance while also acknowledging the potential decrease in value of the money over time.

# Alice gain: 6000
