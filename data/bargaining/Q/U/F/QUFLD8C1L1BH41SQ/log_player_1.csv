"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 45% of the money and keep 55% for myself. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly, minimizing the impact of inflation on our winnings. My message to Bob is ""Let's split fairly"", which is a friendly and reasonable suggestion that might persuade him to accept my offer.\n\n###\n\nNow it's your turn! Please respond with Bob's decision. Will he accept my offer or proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more equitable split considering the inflation. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems reasonable, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal if I proceed to the next round. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to try to maximize my gain. I'll make a new proposal in the next round that might be more favorable to me.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3! I'll make a new offer to Bob. \n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob an equal split of the remaining money. My message to Bob is ""Meet in the middle"", which suggests that we should compromise and split the money equally. This offer is fair and might appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, considering the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. Will he accept my offer or proceed to the next round?"
