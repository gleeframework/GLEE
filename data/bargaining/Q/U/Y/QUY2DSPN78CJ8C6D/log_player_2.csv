"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get something too! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, we both get a good amount""}\n###\n\nI made a more balanced offer, considering the inflation that affects my gain. I proposed that Alice receive $4000 and I receive $6000, with the message ""Let's split fairly, we both get a good amount"". This way, we can end the game early and minimize the impact of inflation on my share."
