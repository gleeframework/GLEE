"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the bigger share this round, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1000, I want to see if I can get a better deal later on.  I'm curious how the inflation will impact things."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation factor. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation and the fact that I'm taking the smaller share this round.  Let's try to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  Even with the inflation, $4500 is a decent amount, and it's better than the risk of getting nothing if we keep going.  I think Alice is trying to be fair."
