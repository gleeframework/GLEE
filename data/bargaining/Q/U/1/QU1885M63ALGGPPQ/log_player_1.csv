"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to have a substantial amount.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair, as I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer and the money is now worth less due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
