"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice's gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500

I'll accept Bob's offer.
