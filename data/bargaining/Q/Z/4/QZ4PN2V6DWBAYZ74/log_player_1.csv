I propose a division of $9000 for myself and $1000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant share, while still offering Bob a small amount to consider."

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I propose a division of $7000 for myself and $3000 for Bob.  The value of the money is quickly declining, but I am trying to find a balance between securing a fair share for myself and incentivizing Bob to accept the offer."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

While this offer is much better than the previous round, I am still confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself. The value of the money continues to decrease, and I am willing to risk a few more rounds to secure a more favorable outcome."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I propose a division of $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob. With each round, the money is worth less, so I need to start offering a more even split to entice Bob to accept."
