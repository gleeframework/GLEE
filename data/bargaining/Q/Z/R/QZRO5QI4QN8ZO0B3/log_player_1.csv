Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too lopsided. Let's be reasonable - this split accounts for the time value and gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
