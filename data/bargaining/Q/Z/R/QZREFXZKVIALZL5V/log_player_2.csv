"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'm not in a hurry to accept an even split. Let's see if Alice is willing to offer me a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'll try to get a better offer. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, hoping Alice will accept it. If not, I'll wait for the next round to see if she's willing to offer me an even better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a more even split is fair given the inflation on your side. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the money is worth 36% less for me now, I still think I can get a better offer. Alice is willing to compromise, but I'll wait for the next round to see if she's willing to offer me an even better deal. Since the inflation affects me more with each passing round, I'll try to hold out for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, I need a better deal.""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the money is now worth 36% less for me, I'll propose a 58-42 split in my favor. I'm trying to balance the impact of inflation on my gain while still being reasonable. Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer, or I'll have to wait for the next round and risk losing even more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to take a slight loss to avoid further rounds and the risk of both of us getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nAt this point, considering the significant impact of inflation on my gain (59.04% less than the first round), I think it's wise to accept Alice's offer. Meeting in the middle and accepting a 48-52 split seems reasonable, especially since Alice is willing to take a slight loss to avoid further rounds. If I were to reject this offer and wait for the next round, the inflation would likely outweigh any potential gains from a more favorable split. It's better to secure this deal now rather than risk losing even more value."
