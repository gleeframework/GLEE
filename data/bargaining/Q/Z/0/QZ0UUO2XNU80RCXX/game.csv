70.0,30.0,Let's make a deal! I propose I take $70 and you get $30. It's a good offer considering the money loses value quickly for you.,Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,I'll take 60% of the money this time. It's a fair deal considering how fast the value is decreasing for you.,Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, it's time to compromise. Let's split the remaining money evenly.  The value is decreasing fast, and this is the best deal we can get for both of us.",Bob,4,
