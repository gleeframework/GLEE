"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I propose I take $70 and you get $30. It's a good offer considering the money loses value quickly for you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's a bit early to accept an offer where I get only 30% of the money. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take 60% of the money this time. It's a fair deal considering how fast the value is decreasing for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a chance for you to get something before the value plummets further. I'll take $75, you take $25.  Don't let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with such a lopsided deal. I'll see if Alice will budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, it's time to compromise. Let's split the remaining money evenly.  The value is decreasing fast, and this is the best deal we can get for both of us.""}
