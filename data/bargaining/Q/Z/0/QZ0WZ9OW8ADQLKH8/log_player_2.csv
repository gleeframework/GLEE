"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a slightly bigger share, but we both get a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'd like to see what Alice offers in the next round, considering the money will be worth less for her then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since you didn't take my offer, let's split it a little more in my favor this time. It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can get this over with.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least 5250 for this to be worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is a fair compromise, and the value of the money is shrinking quickly."
