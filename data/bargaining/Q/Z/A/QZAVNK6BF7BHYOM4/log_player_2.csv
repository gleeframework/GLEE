"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous, split. I'm sure we can work something out that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is ""slightly advantageous"" for Alice, it's a very steep starting point. I'd like to see if we can negotiate a more balanced split, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point.  It's fair, and allows us both to get a decent amount.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both, before inflation eats away at our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split feels more equitable.  We need to reach a solution before we lose too much to inflation.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too one-sided.  While it's a compromise, I believe we can find a more balanced split that benefits us both.  I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference this time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, and it ensures we both get a significant amount before inflation hurts us too much.  Let's be reasonable and work towards a fair solution.""}
