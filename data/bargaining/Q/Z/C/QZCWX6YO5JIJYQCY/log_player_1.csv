"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving just $1 for Bob. This is a very aggressive strategy, but I'm hoping that Bob will accept it in the first round, as he doesn't know about the inflation and might be willing to take anything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While 500,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still less than what I proposed in the first round, and I know the money is worth less with each passing round. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to be more reasonable this time. I'm offering Bob 300,000, which is a lot more than his initial offer, but still leaves me with a substantial portion of the money. I hope he realizes that we're both losing money with each passing round and will be willing to settle for a deal that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting worse for me with each round.  I'm losing more money than he is due to the inflation, and his offer is still not what I'd consider fair. I'm going to try to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly different approach this round. I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is still a significant amount, but I'm also taking a larger share for myself.  I'm hoping that this shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good deal, and it might make him reconsider his own demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still unfair. I'm losing a significant amount of money due to the inflation, and his offer is only getting worse for me. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, even though the stakes are getting higher."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation, and this is the only way I see us both getting something decent. I think Bob might be willing to accept this, as he's also likely losing money from the inflation, even if it's not as significant as mine."
