Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it almost in half, with a slight advantage for me to start this off. It's a fair offer considering the inflation.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""message"": ""Your offer was tempting, but the inflation makes it risky for me in the long run. Let's switch it up this round.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to go a bit closer to the middle. This offer gives us both a decent share considering the inflation hitting me harder. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
