Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer.  I'm taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is to see if he'll be willing to negotiate or if he'll just accept anything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I'd rather take half the money than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
