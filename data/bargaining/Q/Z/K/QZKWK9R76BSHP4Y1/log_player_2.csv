"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A reasonable 60-40 split. Accept and let's be done! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the money is worth less to me each round. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You tried to take advantage of the situation, now it's my turn. 65-35 is the new deal. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better deal, I'm starting to lose a lot of money with each round. Accepting this offer is the best way to minimize my losses."
