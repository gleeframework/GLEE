"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going for a  slightly aggressive opening offer.  I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, knowing that each round hurts Bob more than it hurts me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial offer, but with the added factor of inflation, his offer is actually worth more to him than my initial offer was to me. I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm dropping my offer slightly, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money. The inflation is starting to affect Bob more, and I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly higher for him than my initial offer was for me, even with the inflation.  I'll reject and continue to try and secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still hoping to secure a large portion of the money. The inflation is really starting to bite Bob now, and I think this offer might be tempting enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor, even with the inflation. I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially with the game still in its early stages. I will continue to fight for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm dropping my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a decent portion of the money. The inflation is really starting to hurt Bob now, and I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept a less favorable deal."
