"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, consider the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. Alice benefits more in this scenario, and I'm willing to gamble a bit to try and secure a better outcome for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation affects me more, but I need a bit more than that to agree. This seems fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your concerns, I'll give you a bit less, but we both need to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to inch me down slowly, but it's still not a good deal for Bob given the inflation. I'm hoping she'll get more generous as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""We're getting close!  Let's settle this - this feels like a good compromise to me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer indeed, but I still think I can do a bit better. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting dangerous, but I'm hoping Alice is feeling the pressure too. It's still a better strategy for Bob to hold out for a better offer at this point, even with the increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the inflation is only hurting me more. This is my final offer - let's be reasonable.""}
