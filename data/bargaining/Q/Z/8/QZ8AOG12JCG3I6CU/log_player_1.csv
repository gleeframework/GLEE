"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share, but I'm hoping you'll accept!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy. I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting Bob's offer.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is giving me a good enough deal, especially considering the inflation. I want to negotiate further to get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think you're getting off that easy!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet! The stakes are getting higher! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I need to be careful with my decisions. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than before, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is giving me a good enough deal, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. I want to try to negotiate further to get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth even less due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more conciliatory in this round, but I'm still holding firm on my demand for a decent share. The stakes are getting higher, and I don't want to leave Bob with too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up my last chance to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about my next move. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think the 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting a worse deal."
