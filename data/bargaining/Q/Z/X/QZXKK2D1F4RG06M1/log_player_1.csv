Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation. I'm willing to be flexible, but let's settle this quickly."" 
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is eating away, let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses due to inflation. Waiting longer risks Bob proposing even less favorable terms, and the potential gains from holding out are now outweighed by the increasing devaluation."
