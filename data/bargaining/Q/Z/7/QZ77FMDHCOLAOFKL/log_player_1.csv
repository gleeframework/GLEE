"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a more conservative approach to account for inflation, but I'm willing to give you a larger share than my previous rejection. Will this be enough to seal the deal? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
