Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share.  It's risky, but I think he might accept it to avoid the possibility of getting nothing if we continue.  I'll be watching closely to see how inflation impacts his decisions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like to get more, this offer is a significant improvement from the previous round. I don't know how inflation will affect Bob's decisions in the future, so it's best to secure a good share while I can."
