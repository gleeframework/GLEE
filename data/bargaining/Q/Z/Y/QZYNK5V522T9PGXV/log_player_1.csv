Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

 I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. Since we're playing with inflation, I want to secure the majority of the money right away. Let's see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even with the inflation, a 50/50 split is a fair deal, and I don't want to risk another round and potentially lose more money."
