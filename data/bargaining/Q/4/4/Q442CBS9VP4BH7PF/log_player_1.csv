"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, which I believe is a reasonable and fair division of the $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will see it the same way and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, given that the value of the money decreases each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with the 40-60 split, especially since the value of the money doesn't decrease for me. I think I can get a better deal if I make another offer. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the value of the money decreases for Bob each round. Since Bob's offer of a 40-60 split wasn't acceptable to me, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is slightly more generous than my first one, but still favors me.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Take it before it's too late""}\n\nI hope this offer puts some pressure on Bob to accept, given that the value of the money will continue to decrease for him in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't take less than this considering the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm happy to see that Bob is willing to compromise! However, I notice that this offer is the same as my original proposal in Round 1, which Bob rejected. Given that the value of the money has decreased significantly for Bob since then, I think I can still get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if Bob is willing to make an even more generous offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the significant decrease in value of the money for Bob. Since Bob was willing to offer a 60-40 split in the previous round, I'll try to push for an even more favorable split.

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Last chance before I take it all""}\n\nI'm hoping that Bob will be willing to accept this offer, given that the value of the money will continue to decrease for him in future rounds. The threat of taking it all is just a bluff, but I hope it adds some pressure to the negotiation!"
