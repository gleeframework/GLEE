"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair play, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal. Splitting it evenly might sound fair, but the decreasing value of money for me means I'd actually be losing out compared to Alice. I'll reject this offer and propose a different split in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with the next round. I'll make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the 5% decrease in value for me, so I'm proposing a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss. Hopefully, Alice will understand the reasoning and accept this offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
