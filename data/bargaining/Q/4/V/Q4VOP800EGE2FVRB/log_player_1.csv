Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

While I initially aimed for a higher share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value rapidly. Accepting now secures a decent amount, while further delays mean a smaller overall pie.
* **Fairness:** Bob's proposal is objectively fair. Holding out for a significantly larger share is unlikely to be successful and carries the risk of getting nothing. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're already at Round 4 with only 8 rounds remaining. The longer this drags on, the more desperate the negotiations might become, potentially leading to a worse outcome."
