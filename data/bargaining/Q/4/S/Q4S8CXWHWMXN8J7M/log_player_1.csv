"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'll give you a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair start considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to split it evenly now!

Considering the inflation factor, the offer is actually quite generous from Bob's perspective. If I accept this offer, I'll get $500,000, which is worth 50% of the original amount.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
