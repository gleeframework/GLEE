Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of an even split, but the declining value of the money for you makes it less appealing over time.  This offer is a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. This offer is a good balance between your need to settle quickly and my desire for a fair share. Let's wrap this up.

# Alice gain: 625000

While I would prefer more, the decreasing value of the money means taking this offer is the best option for me. It's better than losing even more in subsequent rounds."
