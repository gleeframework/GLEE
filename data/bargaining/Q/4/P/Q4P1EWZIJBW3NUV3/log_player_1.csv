"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering to take the entire $100, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm hoping for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 80$ (worth 5% less than the original 100$) when I could potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my offer will be worth even less in value, so I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""A bit more balanced, but I'm still hoping for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30$ (worth 30% of the original 100$), which is a slight increase from my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the value of the money quickly!

After considering Bob's offer, I think I'll accept this one. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take 60$ (worth 60% of the original 100$, but actually 14.26% less than the original due to inflation) and call it a day."
