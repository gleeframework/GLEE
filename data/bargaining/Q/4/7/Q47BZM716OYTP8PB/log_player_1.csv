Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more equitable this time. I'm willing to split the money closer to 50/50, as I think that's the fairest way to proceed.  We have 12 rounds to reach an agreement, and I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
