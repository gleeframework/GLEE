"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair this time and split it down the middle.  Inflation is tough, but we can both get something out of this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\nWhy accept this offer? In Round 3, due to inflation, the money is worth 36% less than in the first round. Considering this devaluation, Alice's offer of splitting the money down the middle seems reasonable. Rejecting this offer and proceeding to Round 4 would further decrease the value of the money due to inflation, likely resulting in less value for both parties than the current offer. Accepting the offer now ensures a fair split before the money loses more value."
