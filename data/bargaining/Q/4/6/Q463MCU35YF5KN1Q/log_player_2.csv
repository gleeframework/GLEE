"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk too.  We can negotiate more in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's important to consider the inflation.  The next round, I'll be making the offer, and I'll be able to get more than $100,000, since the money will be worth less to Alice.  It's a risk, but a calculated one!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a more even split.  Let's both take a significant portion, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eroding our gains.""}
