"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. Since the value of the money does not decrease for me but does for Bob, I am incentivized to try to end the game as soon as possible. However, I also want to make an offer that is attractive enough for Bob to accept, given that the value of the money will decrease significantly for him if he chooses to proceed to the next round. This division seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI am rejecting this offer because I believe I can get a better deal. In the previous round, I offered Bob 40% of the money, and now he is offering me 45% of the money. However, considering that the value of the money decreases by 20% for Bob with each passing round, I think he will be more willing to compromise in the next round. I am willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get an even better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Take it before it's too late""}\n\n###\n\nI am increasing my share of the money to 70% in this round, while Bob's share decreases to 30%. Given that the value of the money decreases by 20% for Bob with each passing round, I believe he will be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in the next round. I am trying to create a sense of urgency with my message to persuade Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a little less this time, but I think we can still come to a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI am rejecting this offer because I believe I can still get a better deal. Although Bob is offering to take a little less than in his previous offer, I think he is still overestimating the value of his share. Considering that the value of the money has decreased by 48.8% for Bob since the first round, I believe he will be even more desperate to reach an agreement in the next round. I am willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get an even better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer""}\n\n###\n\nI am increasing my share of the money to 75% in this round, while Bob's share decreases to 25%. Given that the value of the money has decreased significantly for Bob since the first round, I believe he will be desperate to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in the next round. I am trying to convey a sense of finality with my message to persuade Bob to accept this offer. If he rejects, I will have to consider the possibility that he may be willing to walk away with nothing rather than accept an unfavorable deal."
