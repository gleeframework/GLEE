"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but it's not quite fair considering the inflation working against me. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  This accounts for the time value of money.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to make a small concession. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the time pressure and inflation against me, but her concession is minimal. It's better to hold out and counter with a stronger offer in the next round.  There's still time to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. The inflation keeps hurting me, and this ensures we both benefit significantly.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hurting you, but I've already made concessions. This is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice acknowledges the impact of inflation, her offer is far from a ""good compromise.""  She's only increased her offer by $10,000 from her initial lowball offer.  I need to firmly push back and emphasize the unfairness of the situation before time runs out."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm losing a significant amount of money with each round due to inflation, and you're barely budging.  This 48/52 split is a serious offer. Let's be reasonable and end this.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting desperate, but I'm not going to give in that easily. This is my final concession. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical.  While this offer is far from ideal, it's clear Alice is unwilling to negotiate fairly.  Rejecting this leaves me with only five rounds, and the value of the money will continue to plummet.  It's painful, but accepting now guarantees a payout, even if it's less than what I deserve."
