Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to secure a large portion of the money.  Since inflation is a factor, I want to get the most I can as quickly as possible.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the inflation is already starting to bite.  50/50 is a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if Bob continues to reject offers.  Let's take what we can get!"
