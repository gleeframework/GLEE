I'll offer Alice a slightly smaller share, hoping she'll accept to avoid the risk of further rounds."

# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal. I know Alice's money is worth less now, but I'm not sure how much less. I'll keep pushing for a higher share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}

I'm increasing my share again, hoping to take advantage of the inflation affecting Alice's gains.  I'll see if she's willing to accept this offer to avoid further potential losses."

Alice's offer is getting increasingly favorable, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds. I'll accept this offer and secure a good portion of the money before the inflation hits me too."
