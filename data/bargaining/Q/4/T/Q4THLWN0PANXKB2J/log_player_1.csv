"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is mirroring my previous offer. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll need to consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power. However, since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'll have to make a decision based on the nominal value of the money.

In this case, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and hope to do better in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less now due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $520,000 and keeping $480,000 for myself, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power.

However, since Bob's offer is still a 60/40 split, I'll decide to reject it and try to do better in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 69.36% less now due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $680,000 and keeping $320,000 for myself, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm hoping this offer is more attractive to Bob, considering the significant decrease in the value of the money."
