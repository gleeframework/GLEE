"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 80% of the original 5000, which is 4000. This is a good offer, but I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the reduced value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is now worth 90% of its original value, I'll aim for a slightly higher gain to account for the decrease in purchasing power.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, the money is now worth only 72.9% of its original value. Bob's offer is still a bit lopsided, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of value.
