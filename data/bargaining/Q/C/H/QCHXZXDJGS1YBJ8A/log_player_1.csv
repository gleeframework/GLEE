"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to keep 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$. This gives me a big head start, and while it's not ideal for Bob, it's better than him getting nothing in the later rounds if we fail to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than what he offered in round 1, it's still not a fair division. I am confident that we can reach a more equitable solution with more rounds to go."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split, with me taking 600,000 and Bob taking 400,000. While my offer is a bit lower than in the first round, it is still a fair division considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is becoming more equitable considering the effects of inflation, and I want to secure a share of the money before it shrinks further.  While a 40/60 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing."
