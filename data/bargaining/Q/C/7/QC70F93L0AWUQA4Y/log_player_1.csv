"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40. You get a smaller share, but it's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see if he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's take a smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a larger share! 

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm not willing to give him a 70% share, especially considering the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for his next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""A 45-55 split is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming to get a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to take a larger share!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. The money is worth significantly less now, and I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split. I'll wait for his next offer, hoping he'll be more generous."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and getting a reasonable amount for myself."

# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to take a larger share!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. The money is worth significantly less now, and I'm not willing to accept a 38-62 split. I'll wait for his next offer, but I'm getting concerned that we might not reach an agreement soon."

{

  ""bob_gain"": 5400,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up. This is my final offer: 46-54 split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, but I'm not being too greedy. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
