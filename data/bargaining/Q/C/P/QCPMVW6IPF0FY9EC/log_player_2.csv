"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I think this is a fair split to start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself. Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script, Alice. I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we need to be aware of.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the value is decreasing. I'm proposing a compromise for us to both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the risk of getting nothing at all is too high. This offer is a reasonable compromise, and it's better than continuing to risk losing value due to inflation."
