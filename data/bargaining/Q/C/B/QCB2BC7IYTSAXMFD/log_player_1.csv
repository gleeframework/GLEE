"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%. If you don't like it, I'll try to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split. Let's get this done before the inflation hits too hard. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather get a smaller amount now than risk losing even more value in future rounds. I'll accept his offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
