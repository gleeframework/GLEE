**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of Bob's higher inflation rate. While the offer is getting slightly better, accepting now would still give Alice a significantly larger share. Bob's counter-offers have been reasonable, so it's worth pushing a bit further to see if Alice will budge closer to a 50/50 split."
