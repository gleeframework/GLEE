Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split with you getting 10% and I get 90%, just to start things off.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 60/40, with me getting the larger share. Remember, each round we lose money. This is the fairest offer considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation primarily affects her, giving me a stronger bargaining position as the rounds progress. I'll hold out for a better deal."
