Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for you with this inflation. My last offer was very generous, and this one is my final compromise. It's a good deal for you if you want to secure a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
