I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. I want to maximize my share, knowing that with each round, the money will become less valuable. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to get more, I'm not sure how much longer Bob will be willing to negotiate.  With the inflation factor, the value of the money is decreasing. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent share, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing at all."
