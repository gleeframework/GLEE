"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess""
}
```

This way, we both get a fair share to begin with, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want to start with a strong offer 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer where I'll get only 30% of the remaining money, especially since it's worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer for round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my gain with the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a slightly smaller share for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and give you a bigger share, but I still want to get a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than my previous one, I'm still not convinced that I should settle for only 60% of the remaining money, considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the increasing inflation, my offer for round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to think about my own gain""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and ensuring I get a fair amount, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm getting worried about the inflation and want to make sure I get a decent share 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for round 6.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Given the increasing inflation, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer and get 65% of the remaining money, even if it's not my ideal share. At this point, I'm more concerned about getting some value out of the game rather than trying to negotiate for a better deal."
