Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one, but time (and inflation) is working against me.  Alice seems unwilling to budge much from this point, and it's getting increasingly worse for me. Better to take a smaller share now than risk getting even less later."
