"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

This is a straightforward 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but you can still get a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take the lead with a 60-40 split. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal than 40% of the pot. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to give up 40% just yet!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a 55-45 split. This way, I'll still be getting a slightly better deal than before, but Bob will still get a significant amount.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit greedy, Alice! Time to make a move! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of my perceived greediness! His offer of 30-70 is quite aggressive, but I'm not going to back down without a fight.

I'll reject this offer and try to push back with a new proposal that's more in my favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much, Bob! I'll make a counteroffer!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 30-70, I'll try to counter with a 50-50 split again, but this time with a slight twist. I'll offer him a slightly smaller amount, but with a more appealing message.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 499000,
  ""bob_gain"": 501000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A fair deal for both of us!""
}
```"

# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice! I'm taking control now! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation! His offer of 10-90 is extremely lopsided, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

I'll respond with a message that shows I'm not willing to give in:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're pushing your luck, Bob! I'm not going down without a fight!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 10-90, I'll try to make a bold move and offer him a smaller amount, but with a message that shows I'm still confident and willing to negotiate.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up, Bob! You can do better than this!""
}

# Bob's message: You're running out of time, Alice! This is my best offer! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting down to the wire! Since Bob's last offer was 5-95, I'll try to make a bold move and offer him a slightly better deal, but still with a significant amount for myself.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob! Take it or leave it!""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You win this round, Bob, but I'll be back!""
}
```

Since we've reached the 12th round, the game is over, and we'll both walk away with nothing. Well, that was a fun game of negotiation!"
