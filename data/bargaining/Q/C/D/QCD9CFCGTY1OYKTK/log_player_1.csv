"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still holding out for more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money is worth less than before. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and keeping the game going. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be even more careful with my decision. However, Bob's offer is getting closer to my previous proposal, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with diminishing returns."
