"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}

This way, Bob gets a larger share, and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain! Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""bob_gain"": 6500
}

I'm trying to balance the offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one."
