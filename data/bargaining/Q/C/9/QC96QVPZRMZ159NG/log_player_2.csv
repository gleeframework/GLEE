"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000

This is a tough game, and Alice's offer is tempting. However,  Bob should reject this offer.  He stands to gain much more if he waits and lets Alice make the next proposal.  The inflation will hurt Alice more, and it's likely she'll need to offer a much better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that, Alice.  Let's be fair, and split it 90/10.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob, but I need a more balanced split to agree. Let's try 81/19. 
# Bob gain: 1900 
# Alice gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should reject this offer.  While Alice's offer is better than her first, Bob can still do better if he waits. The inflation will continue to hurt Alice more than Bob, and she'll likely have to offer a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8200, ""alice_gain"": 1800, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need a more significant portion of the money.  Let's settle on an 82/18 split.""}
