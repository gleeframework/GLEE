"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Evaluate the offer
Alice's offer gives me $350,000 and her $650,000. This is not an equal split, but I need to consider the impact of inflation if I reject the offer.

## Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation
If I reject the offer, the money will be worth 20% less for me in the next round, and 10% less for Alice. This means that if I were to get the same amount in the next round, it would be worth less to me than it is now.

## Step 3: Determine the minimum acceptable offer
Given the unequal split and the impact of inflation, I need to decide if this offer is acceptable. Since this is the first round, I have 11 more rounds to negotiate, but each round decreases the value of the money.

## Step 4: Make a decision
Considering the above factors, I will reject this offer. I believe I can negotiate a better split in the next rounds, despite the decreasing value of the money.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","## Step 1: Calculate the value of the money after the first round
After the first round, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice. This means that the original $1,000,000 is now worth $800,000 to me and $900,000 to Alice.

## Step 2: Determine a fair offer
Given the decrease in value, I want to make an offer that takes into account the new values but still tries to find a middle ground.

## Step 3: Calculate the offer amounts
I will offer Alice a larger share, but not as large as she offered me in the previous round. I will offer her 55% of the original amount, and I will take 45%.

## Step 4: Calculate the actual offer amounts
Alice's share: 0.55 * $1,000,000 = $550,000
My share: 0.45 * $1,000,000 = $450,000

## Step 5: Attach a message to the offer
I will attach a message to the offer: ""Considering the decrease in value, I think this is a fair offer that gives us both a good amount.""

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the decrease in value, I think this is a fair offer that gives us both a good amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a significant sum considering the declining value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Evaluate the offer
Alice's offer gives me $400,000 and her $600,000. This is still not an equal split, but I need to consider the significant impact of inflation, which has now reduced the value of my potential gain by 36% compared to the first round.

## Step 2: Consider the impact of further inflation
If I reject this offer, the money will continue to lose value, with my share losing another 20% and Alice's losing another 10% in the next round. This means that the value of any future offer will be significantly less.

## Step 3: Compare the offer to the current value
Given the current value reduction, $400,000 now is equivalent to approximately $628,571 in the first round for me (considering a 36% reduction), which is a better offer than the initial $350,000 but still not equal.

## Step 4: Assess the likelihood of a better future offer
Considering the rapid decrease in value and Alice's reluctance to offer an equal split, it's uncertain whether I will receive a better offer in future rounds.

## Step 5: Make a decision
Given the current offer and the significant impact of inflation, I will accept this offer. The risk of further value reduction outweighs the potential for a better offer in future rounds.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
