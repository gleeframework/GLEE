Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very greedy approach in the first round. I'll take almost everything and see if Bob is willing to accept such a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject the offer. While this is a big improvement over the previous offer, I believe I can get a better deal if we continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to raise my offer slightly, giving Bob a little more.  I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize him to accept, but I still want to secure the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 999990 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a bigger share, Bob's offer is much better than the last one I received.  Since inflation is affecting Bob much more than me, it's likely that he will only get more stubborn and less willing to share in future rounds.  It's time to take what I can get."
