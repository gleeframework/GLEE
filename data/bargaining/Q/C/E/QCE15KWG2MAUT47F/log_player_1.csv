"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob! Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the initial amount, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my decision-making accordingly.

I'll analyze the offer:

* Alice gain: $200,000 (worth 95% of $200,000 from Round 1)
* Bob gain: $800,000 (worth 80% of $1,000,000 from Round 1)

Considering the decreased value of the money, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept it.
