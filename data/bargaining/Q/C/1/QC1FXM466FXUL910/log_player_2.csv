Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince I'm Bob, I don't think this is a fair split. I think I deserve more than 40% of the total amount. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\nAlso, I'd like to remind Alice that with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less due to inflation. So, it's in our best interest to come to an agreement soon.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
