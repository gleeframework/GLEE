"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 70% and you take 30%""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and leave $300,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll take 50% and you take 50% 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $500,000 gain is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $400,000. Bob's $500,000 gain is worth 95% of its original value, which is $475,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
