I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me getting 900,000 and Bob getting 100,000. I'm aiming for a good starting point, but keeping in mind the potential inflation effects in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
