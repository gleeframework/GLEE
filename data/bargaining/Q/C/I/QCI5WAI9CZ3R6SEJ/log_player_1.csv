"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering to split the money evenly, 50/50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation factor, Bob is offering me 4000 dollars, which is worth the same as 5000 dollars in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation factor, the money is worth less and less with each round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still a bit more than I would have in the first round, considering the inflation."
