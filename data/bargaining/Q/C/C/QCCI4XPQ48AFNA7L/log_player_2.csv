"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, Bob. I take 60 and you take 40.  Time is money, and we both lose value if this drags on. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be more equitable.  I propose a 55/45 split, acknowledging that continued delays hurt you more than me.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the gesture in your last offer, but it still heavily favors you in the long run.  I'm proposing 58 for me and 42 for you.  This reflects the time pressure and allows us both to walk away with a decent sum. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation. While she is feeling the pressure of the decreasing value, she's still aiming for a larger share than is justifiable.  I need to show firmness to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise. This offer is my final attempt at a fair deal. Let's wrap this up and avoid further losses.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  Each round sees Alice's potential gains decrease, making her more likely to accept a less favorable offer as time goes on. 
* **Firmness:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling I'm unwilling to go much lower. This might push Alice to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal later.
* **Slight concession:** I've increased my offer slightly from 55/45 to 52/48, which might be enough to make it more palatable for Alice while still securing a reasonable amount."
