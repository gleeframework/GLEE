"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and reasonable from the start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see how Alice reacts to my counter-offer.  I'm not sure she will accept this, but I'm hoping she will be reasonable and recognize that we both stand to gain more from working together."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous with this offer, but we need to find a way to maximize our gains.  Let's work together and see if we can find a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm making a compromise. Let's settle this before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, accepting Alice's offer is the best option given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting."
