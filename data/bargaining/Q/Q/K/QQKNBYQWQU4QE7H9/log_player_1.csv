"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll accept it to avoid further negotiation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
