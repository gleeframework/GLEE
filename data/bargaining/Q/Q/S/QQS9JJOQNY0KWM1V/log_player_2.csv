"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to counter with a more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 38.5 
# Alice gain: 61.5 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money I gain, I need to be more cautious. However, 38.5 is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk Alice making an even better offer in the next round. I'll accept this offer.
