"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in getting something rather than risking going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, it's a fair and simple start 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, and I'm not sure if I can do better than a 50/50 split. However, I'd like to try to get a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I can do better than 50/50, but I'd like to try to get 55/45""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in getting a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to push for a 60/40 split or more, as that might be too aggressive."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 10% less (5% from the previous round) for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal for you!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a decent amount, considering the decreasing value of the money for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a balance between giving me a decent share and keeping a significant amount for himself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think this is a good deal for both of us. Let's take it!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering the decreasing value of the money for him. I'm willing to compromise and take a slightly smaller share in order to end the game and get some money."
