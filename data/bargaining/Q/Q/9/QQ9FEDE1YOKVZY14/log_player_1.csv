"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split of $900,000 for myself and $100,000 for Bob. I think this is a fair offer, as I'm taking a larger share but leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer to have more, the inflation will only make the situation worse for both of us with each passing round. It's better to accept this offer and end the game now."
