"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but don't expect it to last! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, and I think I can do better. I'll pass on this offer and make a new proposal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but don't get too comfortable!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
