"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 60/40 split.  Let's get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I respect your desire for a quick resolution, I believe this reflects a more balanced outcome considering the changing value of the money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to get a better deal than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the offer. While I'd prefer more, the inflation is making things tough, and Alice's offer is more reasonable than my last one."
