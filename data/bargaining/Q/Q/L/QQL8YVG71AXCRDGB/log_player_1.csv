  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share!

I'll reject this offer. A 7/3 split is not acceptable to me, especially when I'm getting a smaller share in terms of actual value. I think I can do better than that.

Since I've rejected this offer, I'm assuming that we'll both get nothing, as we've reached the 12th round."
