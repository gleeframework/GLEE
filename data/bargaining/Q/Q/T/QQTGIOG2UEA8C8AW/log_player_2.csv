"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's always good to try to get a slightly better deal for yourself, even if it's just a little bit.  I'll see if I can get Alice to give me a bit more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a little bit more, Alice, but I'm also hoping for a slightly better deal for myself.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I hope we can reach a solution that feels fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5100 
# Alice gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and the offer is fairly close to what I originally wanted.  It's better to accept this offer and move on than to risk further rounds of negotiation and potential loss due to inflation."
