650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair split, but your offer wasn't reasonable considering the faster rate of inflation affecting your gains.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to account for the risk.",Alice,3,

580000.0,420000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and this back and forth isn't helping anyone. This offer is a compromise - it acknowledges the inflation disparity but still gets us a decent amount.  Let's be sensible and close the deal.",Bob,4,

620000.0,380000.0,"Bob, you're right about the time crunch, but I can't accept an offer that doesn't reflect the reality of the situation. This offer is a compromise - closer to your last offer, but still acknowledging that I lose out more with each passing round.",Alice,5,
