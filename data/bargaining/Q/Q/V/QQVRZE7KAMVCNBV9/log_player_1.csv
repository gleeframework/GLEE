"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiations!""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting $500,000, which is more than Bob's offer of $400,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.
