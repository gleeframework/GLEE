"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me a larger share of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's share, I'll consider his offer more carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take the 50% share, and we can end the game."
