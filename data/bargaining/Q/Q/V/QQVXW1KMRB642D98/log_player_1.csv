"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, a fair and simple beginning!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair starting point, and we can reassess as we go along."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a bit more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, and I think it's a bit too skewed towards Bob. I was hoping for a more even split, especially considering we're just starting out. I'd like to propose something else."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Let's see if this 45/55 split works for you.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, giving Bob a slightly larger share while still keeping some of the original 50/50 split."
