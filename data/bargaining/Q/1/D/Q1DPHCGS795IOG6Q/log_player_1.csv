Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive first offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money.  I'll be curious to see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than my previous proposal after inflation, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll be the one making the proposal next round, and I'll take inflation into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800} 
```

I'm taking the inflation into account and aiming for a slightly lower gain this round. This offer still gives me a large portion of the money while being more reasonable for Bob. Hopefully, this will convince him to accept before the value of the money decreases further for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation has taken a significant bite out of the potential gains, and while I would prefer a slightly better split, this offer is still reasonable and secures a decent amount of money for me.  Further rounds will likely only decrease the value for both of us, so it's better to settle now."
