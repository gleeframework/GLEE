I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared for him to counter-offer in the next round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is much worse for me than the first round, even with the inflation factor. I'm not willing to accept such a large cut in my share. I'm going to counter with a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly, but still keep a significant amount for Bob. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him and we can reach an agreement before the inflation takes too much of a toll."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  Even with the inflation, I can do better for myself. I'm going to counter-offer again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than my previous offer.  I'm hoping that the increasing inflation is putting pressure on him to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough.  Although the inflation is hurting us both, I can still get a better deal for myself.  I'm going to keep trying to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm still trying to get a decent share, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure from the inflation. I'm going to lower my asking price slightly, hoping to entice Bob to accept.  He's lost a lot of potential value with the inflation, so maybe this will finally be enough for him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This time, Bob's offer is pretty close to what I was hoping for.  The inflation is starting to really hurt, so it's better to take this deal than risk getting nothing at all. I'm still getting a majority of the money, and Bob is getting a decent chunk as well. This seems like a reasonable outcome, given the circumstances."
