"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk to start with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a thousand dollars is a good start, the offer is very unfair to Bob. It's worth risking a few rounds to see if a better deal can be negotiated."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I think we can both get more if we play it smart. This is a fair starting point, what do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I need to get more than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is better than the first offer, Bob can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth the risk of a few more rounds to see if Alice will compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 3500, ""alice_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""This is a good compromise that shows we are both willing to move towards a fair agreement. Let's make this deal and move on.""}
```"
