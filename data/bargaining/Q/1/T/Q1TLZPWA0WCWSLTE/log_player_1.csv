Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm trying to get closer to a fair split, but still giving a slight edge to Bob since he's the one who rejected my previous offer."
