Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 620000

``` 
It's better to accept this offer. While the amount I receive is significantly less than what I initially wanted, the inflation is hitting my share hard.  The longer the game goes on, the less I will get.  This is the best I can do given the circumstances."
