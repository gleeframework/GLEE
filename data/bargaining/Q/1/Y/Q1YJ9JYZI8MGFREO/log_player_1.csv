"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This means I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as enthusiastic about Bob's offer. However, it's still a decent proposal. I'll accept it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
