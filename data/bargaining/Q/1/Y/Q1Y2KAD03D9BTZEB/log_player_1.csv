"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's shake hands!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a fair deal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a 20% bite out of Bob's share, I'm not so sure this is a fair deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is still a decent amount, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more games! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a significant bite out of Bob's share, I'm starting to think that meeting in the middle might not be such a bad idea. It's a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the situation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
