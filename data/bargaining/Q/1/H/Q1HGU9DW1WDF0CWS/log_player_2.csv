Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. 55/45 is my final offer. Take it or leave it, we're both losing serious money! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money. Waiting any longer significantly reduces the overall payout for both of us.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her ""final offer"" suggests she's unlikely to budge further.  Rejecting this offer risks her becoming even less flexible in future rounds.
* **Reasonable Split:**  55/45 is not drastically unfair.  It's better to secure a decent amount now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
