"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Consider the decreasing value - a good deal for you now is better than a potential better deal later. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a good share, Alice, but I need to make sure I get a decent return too. Let's split the money 55/45 in my favor.  It's a fair compromise considering the value is decreasing with each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I countered your previous offer with a more balanced one considering the decreasing value.  This is my final offer; let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better split, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers.  With the decreasing value, it's better to secure a decent gain now than risk losing even more in the next round."
