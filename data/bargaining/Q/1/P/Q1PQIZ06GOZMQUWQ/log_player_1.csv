"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and reasonable offer 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Since I had $900,000 in the first round, I now have $810,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but it's a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept it.
