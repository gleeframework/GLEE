"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you 20% of the money, and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a decent amount, but I'm also positioning myself to gain the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is slightly better than mine in the first round. However, I'm still getting a better deal than Bob is offering.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.
