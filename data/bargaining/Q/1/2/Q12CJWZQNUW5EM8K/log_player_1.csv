"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'll start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, aiming for a larger share while leaving a small amount for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation means my gain is worth less than before.  Accepting Bob's offer secures me 60 dollars, which is a significant amount, and it's likely I won't get a better offer in the next round."
