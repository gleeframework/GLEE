Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to hurt my potential earnings!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because the difference between our shares is getting too large, and I'm not comfortable with the idea of taking only 20% of the total amount. I'd like to try to negotiate a more balanced split."
