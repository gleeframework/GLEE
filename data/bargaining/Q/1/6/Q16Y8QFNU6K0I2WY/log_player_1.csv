"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but it's still a significant amount for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this as a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 215687 
# Bob gain: 784313 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a significant drop from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to accept such a small portion of the money, even with the inflation factor. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to acknowledge the inflation, but I still believe this offer is fair given the current circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the money I'm getting is a lot lower than what I initially wanted, due to the inflation, I'm not sure I can get a better offer in the next round. I'll accept this and take the 400,000$."
