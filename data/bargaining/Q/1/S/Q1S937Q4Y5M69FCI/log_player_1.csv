"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money into 6000 and 4000 dollars. This ensures a fair split considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the money is losing value each round. This ensures we both get a decent share before the value drops too much. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
