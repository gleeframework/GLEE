Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical, Alice.  This offer is closer to my last one, and we're running out of time.  It's in both our best interests to reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

This is a tough situation, but I still think holding out a bit longer is the better play. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  Bob knows time is working against you due to inflation. He's likely to become more generous as the deadline approaches.
* **Previous Offer:** You offered him 450,000 in the last round, and he rejected it. Accepting a worse deal now makes no strategic sense. 

Let's see if we can get him closer to a 50/50 split in the next couple of rounds."

{
""alice_gain"": 525000,

}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to move a bit closer to your last offer, but this is my final offer.  Let's not risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

This is a tough decision, but here's why accepting is the best course of action at this point:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Inflation is eating away at your potential gains. While not ideal, getting $475,000 is better than risking getting $0 if we go to round 7 and beyond.
* **Bob's Stance:** His message suggests this is his best offer.  Continuing to reject might make him dig in his heels, leading to a worse outcome for both of us. 

Let's secure what we can get at this stage."
