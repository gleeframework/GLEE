Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer. I'll take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000.  It's a high risk, high reward strategy.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  I'll accept."
