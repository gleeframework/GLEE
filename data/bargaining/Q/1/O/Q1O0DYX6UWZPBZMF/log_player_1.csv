"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would get $500,000 and Bob would get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight tilt in my favor, but still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I don't like the fact that Bob is getting a bigger share than me, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round. Considering the inflation effect, I'm not sure what the money will be worth in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
