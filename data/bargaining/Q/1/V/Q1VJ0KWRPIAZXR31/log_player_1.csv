"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  We can both benefit from this and get closer to what we want. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is not ideal, accepting it secures a gain for Alice, even with the 20% inflation. Rejecting it means moving to the next round where Alice would have to offer a larger share to Bob to potentially get him to accept.  

**Key Considerations:**

* **Inflation:** The 20% inflation is a significant factor, making it harder to gain more in subsequent rounds.
* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting risks potentially getting a worse offer in the next round, while accepting secures a gain."
