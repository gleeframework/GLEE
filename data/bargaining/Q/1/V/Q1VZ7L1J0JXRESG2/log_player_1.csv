"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'll take $600,000. I've included a message, ""Let's be reasonable,"" to convey that this is a fair offer and we should consider the decreasing value of money due to inflation. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference and get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle before it's too late""}\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of money, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and we can conclude the game before the money loses more value. Your turn, Bob!"
