"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which is $60, and leaving 40% for Bob, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Since Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than my previous offer, I'll consider it. However, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was close to a 50/50 split, I'll make a new offer that's even closer to that. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair and balanced proposal."
