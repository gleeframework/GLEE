"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $60, you take $40. It's a good offer, consider accepting it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's not fair that Alice gets to take more than half of the money. I think I can do better than that. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we should divide the money more evenly. I'll take $55, and you can have $45. It's a fair offer, considering the money will be worth less in the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the money is losing value fast. Let's be reasonable. I'll take the $55 you offered last round, and you take the $45. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a reasonable offer, considering the money is losing value fast. I'll accept this offer to avoid losing even more value in the next round."
