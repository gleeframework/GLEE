"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 40% and you can have the rest. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

I'm not sure if 40% is a good compromise, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not go into another round, but I'm not sure if this is the best offer I can get.
