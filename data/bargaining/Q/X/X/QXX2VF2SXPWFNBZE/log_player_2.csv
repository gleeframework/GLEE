"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, but you get a decent chunk. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a bigger share. Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering we both have to agree to it.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still need a decent amount to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a bigger share, it's better to take the offer now. Alice's share is getting increasingly devalued with each round, so there's a good chance she'll become less willing to compromise later."
