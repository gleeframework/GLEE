"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, and keep it simple. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease let Bob know!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the current value of the money after inflation.
After two rounds, the money has decreased in value by 10% each round. So, the current value of the $10,000 is 10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $8,100.

### Step 2: Decide on a new offer that takes into account the decreased value and the goal of reaching an agreement.
Given that Bob's offer to split it evenly was rejected, and considering the decreased value of the money, a new offer should aim to find a middle ground that is slightly more favorable to Alice but still reasonable for Bob.

### Step 3: Calculate the new offer amounts for Alice and Bob.
Considering the need to find a balance and the impact of inflation, let's propose that Alice takes a bit more than half, considering the value has decreased. A possible split could be 55% for Alice and 45% for Bob of the original $10,000, but adjusted for the current value.

### Step 4: Adjust the amounts according to the current value of the money.
However, since the actual value we're negotiating over is the original $10,000, the split will be proposed based on this, but with the understanding that its real value is now $8,100. Thus, the proposal remains in terms of the original value for simplicity.

### Step 5: Formulate the message to Bob.
The message should reflect the reasoning behind the proposal, emphasizing the need for a mutually agreeable solution that considers the decreasing value of the money.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}"
