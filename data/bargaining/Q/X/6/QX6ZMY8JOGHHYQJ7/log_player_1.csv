"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of 60 is still worth 60, but Bob's gain of 55 is worth 55 * 0.95 = 52.75, which is less than my gain of 60. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 55, I'll try to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer. My gain of 58 is still worth 58, but Bob's gain of 50 is worth 50 * 0.85 (95% of the original value) = 42.5, which is less than my gain of 58. However, this time Bob's offer is 50:50, which is a fair split. I'll accept this offer.
