Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share considering the decreasing value of my gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob claims to be compromising, the deal is getting worse for me with each round.  Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Time is on my side:** Bob's money is rapidly losing value. The longer we wait, the more desperate he'll become for any deal.
* **Holding strong:** I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair share. Consistently rejecting bad offers strengthens my position. 
* **Aiming for a better deal:** I'm confident I can get a better offer than 45% in a future round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 620000,
""bob_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  This offer still gives you a decent chunk, but we both know delaying hurts you more than me.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I've reduced my demand slightly from Round 3 to show willingness to negotiate, but not by much. 
* **Emphasizing the time pressure:** I need to keep reminding Bob that each round makes the deal significantly worse for him. 
* **Targeting a sweet spot:** I'm aiming for a deal that's good for me, but not so outrageous that Bob will refuse out of principle. He needs to see it's genuinely in his best interest to accept sooner rather than later."
