"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A more even split! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for a 50/50 split just yet. I think I can do better than that. The game is on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more uneven split this time, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, Alice. Let's split it 60/40, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite generous to himself this time!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split in my favor, especially since I was the one who made the initial proposal. I think I can do better than that. The game is heating up!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit greedy, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm going for a more aggressive split this time, with me getting 80% of the $100 and Bob getting just 20%. It's a risk, but I think it's worth it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting tired of this, Alice. Let's split it 70/30, or we both get nothing.

# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of the game!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially after I've been pushing for a more favorable split earlier. I think I can do better than that. The game is getting intense!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm not going to back down yet! Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging, Bob. Take it or walk away!""
}
```

I'm going for a very aggressive split this time, with me getting 85% of the $100 and Bob getting just 15%. It's a bold move, but I'm confident I can get away with it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept a 20/80 split, especially after I've been pushing for a more favorable split earlier. I think I can do better than that. The game is getting desperate, but I'm not ready to give in yet!"

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

{
  ""alice_gain"": 95,
  ""bob_gain"": 5,
  ""message"": ""I'm making one last desperate attempt, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm going for an extremely aggressive split this time, with me getting 95% of the $100 and Bob getting just 5%. It's a long shot, but I'm willing to take the risk!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last chance, Alice. I'm taking it all. You should have been more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is taking the whole pie!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with nothing. I'd rather walk away with nothing than let Bob take the entire $100. It was a fun game, but I guess I should have been more reasonable from the start!"
