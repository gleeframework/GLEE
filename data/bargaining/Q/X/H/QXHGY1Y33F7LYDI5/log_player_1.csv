"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, Bob. I'll give you a fair share, but don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial $10,000. This way, I'll get $8,000, which is 80% of the initial amount. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not impressed with your initial offer. I'm willing to compromise, but you'll have to do better. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation!

Considering the reduced values, my gain of $6,000 is worth 90% of the initial $8,000 I proposed, and Bob's gain of $4,000 is worth 80% of the initial $5,000 he proposed.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, Bob. I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is 30% of the initial $10,000, and I'll take $7,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"

Round 4

# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need a better deal than that. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $6,500 is worth 65% of the initial $10,000, and Bob's gain of $3,500 is worth 35% of the initial $10,000.

Considering the reduced values, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems Bob is still trying to get a better deal. However, I'm getting closer to the middle ground, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a worse deal in the next round. I'll accept this offer.
