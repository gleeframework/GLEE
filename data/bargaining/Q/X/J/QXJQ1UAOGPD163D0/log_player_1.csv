"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, my gain of 50 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 50 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round. This offer is a significant improvement for me, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and 25% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself to compensate.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
