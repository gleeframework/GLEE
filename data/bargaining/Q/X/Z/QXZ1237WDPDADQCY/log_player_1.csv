"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a fair share considering the initial amount of $10,000. My message is a friendly reminder that accepting this offer will end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my decision accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather wait for a better offer. 50/50 isn't as attractive as it seems.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is a slightly more generous share, but still a bit more than I think I can get away with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the significant drop in value, I'll have to reassess my decision. Since Bob is offering me $4,500, which is a relatively fair share, I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you've convinced me. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finally conclude the game!"
