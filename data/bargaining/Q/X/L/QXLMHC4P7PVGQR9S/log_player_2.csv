# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with starting off taking such a small share. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can work something out.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This is closer to your proposal, but still reflects the value decrease from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice is being more reasonable, and this offer is better for me than my last one. I'm willing to accept it."
