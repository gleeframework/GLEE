{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50, a fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering the initial 60-40 split I offered in round 1 and the 30-70 split Bob offered in round 2."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 20-80 split, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'm getting a bit concerned about the inflation and how it's affecting my gains, but I'm not willing to settle for such an unfair split yet."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet! Let's try again!""}

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous offer, but I'm still trying to hold on to a decent share of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle and find a compromise."
