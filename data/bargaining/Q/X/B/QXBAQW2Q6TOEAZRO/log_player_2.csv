"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll get a chance to propose next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a bit risky to accept such a lopsided offer in the first round.  While I could use the extra $1000 now, it's worth seeing what Alice is willing to offer in future rounds, especially with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be a bit more equitable this time. I'm willing to split the money closer to the middle, but we need to start being more reasonable if we want to get this done.""}
