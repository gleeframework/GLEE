"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain in this round are:

* My gain: $5,000
* Bob's gain: $4,000 (20% of $5,000 is $1,000 less than my gain)

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split, considering the value of my gain is still higher than Bob's gain, even after accounting for the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the 50-50 split, I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, the money is now worth less, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining $10,000, which is $4,500, and keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slight majority 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the new values, my gain of $4,500 is actually worth less than my previous offer of $5,500, but Bob's gain of $5,500 is even less valuable than my gain. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about this offer, I'd like to think about it.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues! Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to counter with a 55-45 split in my favor, but with a slightly smaller amount for Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slight majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 48% of the remaining $10,000, which is $4,800, and keeping $5,200 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, 52-48 split 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the new values, my gain of $4,800 is actually worth less than my previous offer of $5,200, but Bob's gain of $5,200 is even less valuable than my gain. However, I'm getting closer to the middle ground, and I think this offer is a reasonable compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's meet in the middle. I accept your offer.""
}
