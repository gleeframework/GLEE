"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the relative values. Bob is offering a 40/60 split, which is a bit more skewed towards him. I'll have to decide whether it's worth proceeding to the next round.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I rejected Bob's previous offer, I'll try to get a better deal this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting Bob's gain significantly! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the relative values again.

Bob's offer is a 48/52 split, which is closer to a 50/50 split than my previous offer. However, I'm still getting a slightly better deal than before.

I'll accept this offer.
