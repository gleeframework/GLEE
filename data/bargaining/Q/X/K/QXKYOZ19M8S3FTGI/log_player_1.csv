"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering you 40% of the original $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept this offer. The 40% I'll get is still worth more to me than the 60% I would get in the next round, considering the inflation.
