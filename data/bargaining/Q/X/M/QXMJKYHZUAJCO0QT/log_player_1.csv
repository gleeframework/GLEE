"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly better deal, but still a fair one 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is a 40/60 split, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 40/60, I think I can make a more aggressive offer this time. I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You took a 60/40 split last round, so I'm taking a slightly better deal this time""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly better deal this time, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money Bob gains is worth less than in the first round, I think I can take a slightly better deal this time. However, I'm not sure if I should push for more. I'll accept this offer.
