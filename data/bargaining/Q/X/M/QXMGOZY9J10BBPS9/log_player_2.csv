# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation rate I'm experiencing. While the offer is better than nothing, I still think I can negotiate a better deal in the coming rounds."

# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is getting worse! Alice is clearly banking on me panicking as the rounds go by. However, I'm not going to accept a deal this bad. There's still a chance for a more reasonable outcome."
