"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as Alice. This is a good starting point, giving Bob a small share but ensuring I get the majority.  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each round, this offer should be appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than my initial proposal.  Even though his offer would have been attractive in the first round, the inflation makes it much less appealing. By rejecting this offer, I can ensure a better outcome for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 80/20, still in my favor, but showing flexibility. Bob's offer in the last round likely made him realize that he needs to be more reasonable to get a deal done. This offer gives him a chance to benefit from the inflation while still securing a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even considering the inflation. While the money is worth less to him, his offer is still significantly less than my initial proposal. I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm decreasing my share further to 70/30.  While this is less than my initial offer, it's still a significant advantage for me. Bob's persistent refusal suggests that he may be overconfident in his ability to secure a better deal, which could lead to a less favorable outcome for him. This offer attempts to strike a balance between my desired outcome and the need to secure a deal before further inflation erodes the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even considering the inflation. He's clearly trying to take advantage of the dwindling time. By rejecting, I can try to leverage the pressure of the approaching deadline to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm reducing my share further to 60/40, which is still a favorable outcome for me. Bob's persistent rejections demonstrate his stubbornness, and I believe he's starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling time. This offer reflects a willingness to compromise while maintaining a significant share of the money.  With only five rounds remaining, I need to secure a deal before the inflation further reduces the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even considering the significant inflation he's facing. He's clearly not grasping the urgency of the situation.  I'm confident that I can still secure a more favorable outcome by rejecting this offer and making a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only four rounds remaining, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This offer is fair, considering the significant inflation that Bob is facing. It also reflects my willingness to compromise, as this is the first offer that doesn't favor me. I believe this offer has a high chance of being accepted as Bob is losing money at a much faster rate than me. If he rejects this, he risks getting nothing at all in the end."
