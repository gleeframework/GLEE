"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple!""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, which is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $50 is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd actually be getting $40. And Bob's $50 is now worth 95% of its original value, so he'd be getting $59.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $40, which is a good deal considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
