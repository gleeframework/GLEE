"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and reasonable!""}\n\n### 

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself. My message to Bob is ""Let's be fair and reasonable!"" to encourage him to accept the offer.

Please let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer, and if he rejects, I'll wait for his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something fair. This is a good deal before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't see a reason to accept an offer that gives me less than what I initially proposed. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal.

Please let me know when it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""}\n\n### 

I'm offering Bob 42 dollars and keeping 58 dollars for myself. My message to Bob is ""Let's meet in the middle!"" to suggest a compromise between our previous offers.

Since Bob's money is worth 10% less now due to inflation (5% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept a slightly less favorable offer.

Please let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although Bob's message suggests that he's getting frustrated and wants to end the game, I still don't see a reason to accept an offer that gives me less than what I initially proposed. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I can afford to wait for a better offer.

Additionally, I know that Bob's money is worth 14.26% less now due to inflation, which means that his half of the $100 is actually worth less than $50 to him. This gives me more bargaining power, and I'll try to use it to my advantage in the next round.

Please let me know when it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Last chance for a good deal!""}\n\n### 

I'm offering Bob 43 dollars and keeping 57 dollars for myself. My message to Bob is ""Last chance for a good deal!"" to suggest that this is the best offer he's going to get from me.

Since Bob's money is worth 19.1% less now due to inflation (5% less in each of the four rounds that have passed, compounded), I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to accept a slightly less favorable offer now rather than risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

Please let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer!"
