"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we split the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I think we both can benefit from this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money, I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to get a bit more, considering the money is worth less than it was in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I'd like a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $52 and Bob gets $48, hoping that this compromise will be acceptable to him."
