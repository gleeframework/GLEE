"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm keeping most of the money for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess my decision.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a fair split considering the reduced value of the money."
