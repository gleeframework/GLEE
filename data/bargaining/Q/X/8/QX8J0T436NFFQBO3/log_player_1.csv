"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering we both lose value with each round. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it and wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take 40% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 60%. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
