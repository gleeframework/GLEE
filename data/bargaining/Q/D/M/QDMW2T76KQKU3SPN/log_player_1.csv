"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob 40%. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a closer split. I'm willing to take slightly less to ensure a quicker resolution. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to consider it since Bob is trying to compromise. I'll accept this offer for now.
