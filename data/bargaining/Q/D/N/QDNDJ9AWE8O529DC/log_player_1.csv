"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'd rather try to get more. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

My gain of $4500 is worth 45% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8% = 51.2% and 100% - 51.2% = 48.8%).
Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 55% of what it was in the first round (100% - 44.9% = 55.1% and 100% - 55.1% = 44.9% but 100% - 44.9% = 55.1% so 55% is a good enough approximation).

Considering the inflation, I'll accept this offer.
