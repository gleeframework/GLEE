"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to start by being generous.  I figure Bob might not know about the inflation, so I'll give him a small amount. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Bob is being extremely greedy, and I know that the money is losing value with each round. I'm going to try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to offer a more even split this time, hoping Bob will realize that continuing to be greedy will only hurt him in the long run.  We're both losing money with each passing round, and I'm willing to compromise to get something before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the better end of the deal. I'm going to keep rejecting these offers. The inflation is hurting both of us, but I'm not going to give in to his demands. I need to make sure I get a reasonable share of the money before it's all gone."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to try offering a slightly higher share for myself, but still offering a decent amount for Bob.  I want to find a middle ground where we can both agree and get some money before we lose it all to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being extremely greedy, and the inflation is only getting worse. I refuse to accept this offer, and I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm determined to get a fairer share of the money before it's all gone."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share this time. I know we're both losing money with each round, so I need to push for a better deal for myself. I'm hoping Bob realizes that we need to reach a compromise soon before it's too late."
