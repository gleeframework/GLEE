"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's better than nothing, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair deal, and it gives Alice a chance to avoid getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer. While it's a better deal than the previous round, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, especially since the inflation rate is increasing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  I'm trying to find a compromise that will be fair to both of us, while still giving me a decent share of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  The inflation is getting significant and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm trying to be reasonable, but inflation is starting to seriously impact the value of the money. I need to get a better deal for myself to account for that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  The inflation rate is getting very high, and I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I might end up with nothing at all in the next round.  While I'd prefer a better deal, this is still a significant amount of money after the inflation."
