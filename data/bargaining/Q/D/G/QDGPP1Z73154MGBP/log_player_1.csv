Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept this offer since it's my turn to propose next and I don't want to give Bob more than he's offering.
