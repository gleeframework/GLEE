"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take the larger share this time, consider the discount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn again, the deal won't get better for you 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Time is running out, this is a reasonable offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the deal is getting worse, accepting only $40 after 5 rounds is a terrible outcome.  There's still a chance to negotiate a better split, even if it means accepting a slightly smaller amount later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is a fair split, let's end this before the inflation hurts us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side, don't wait any longer 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting tricky! Alice is right, the clock is ticking, and my bargaining power is diminishing. However, accepting $38 is very low. Let's gamble a little more:

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm hoping that Alice will start getting nervous as we get closer to the final rounds and she gets nothing. There's a chance she'll offer a more reasonable amount soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it - we both lose if it goes any longer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to draw a line in the sand. Offering a slight advantage to Alice, while still securing a decent amount for myself, might be the best way to avoid disaster. The ""final offer"" message adds pressure and signals I'm serious."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Alice is clearly feeling confident, and my position is weakening. However, $35 is a very low amount, and there's still a slight chance I can get a better deal.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a risky move, but I'm betting on Alice potentially panicking as we get closer to the final rounds.  If she doesn't budge soon, I'll be forced to accept a bad deal in the last round or get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is it - the very last chance. I won't go lower. Let's be reasonable and end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's desperation time.  I need to make Alice understand this is the absolute bottom line. Offering her the original split she wanted (but with less overall value due to inflation) might be the only way to salvage something before we both get nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, I'm taking most of it 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","This is terrible, but I have no choice. 

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:** I have no leverage left. If I reject this, Alice knows I'll get nothing in the final round and she'll likely offer me even less. Accepting $30 is a significant loss, but it's better than nothing.  This illustrates how crucial early negotiation and a clear understanding of the game's dynamics are for success."
