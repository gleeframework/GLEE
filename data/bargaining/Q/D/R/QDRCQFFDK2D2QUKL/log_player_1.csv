"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair split: 90% for me, 10% for you.  Let's get this done quickly!""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50. No need to negotiate, let's just split it down the middle. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, 500,000 is still a significant amount, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a much better result, especially considering the inflation."
