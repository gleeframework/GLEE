Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than I would have gotten in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round. Considering this, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to increase the chances of a successful negotiation."

# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate to get a better deal. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 30$. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
