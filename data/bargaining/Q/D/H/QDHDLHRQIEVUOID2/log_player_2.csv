"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and get this done quickly. I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a generous starting offer, and we can avoid the inflation risks. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is generous, I believe a more even split is possible. We have time to negotiate, and I'm not willing to settle for such a large disparity right away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fairer starting point. We both get a good share, and it minimizes the risk of inflation eating away at our earnings. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a bigger share, but I'm not willing to go that low. Let's compromise. I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering the inflation, and we can avoid further losses.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than her first, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident we can find a more equitable split, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation. Let's keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. Inflation is biting into our potential gains. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise that considers the time we've spent negotiating and the potential future losses.  Let's agree and move forward.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair compromise that accounts for the inflation and allows us to avoid further losses.  Let's end this negotiation and get the money divided. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While a 50/50 split would be ideal, Alice's offer is the best we can hope for at this point.  The inflation is hitting her much harder than me, and further negotiation could lead to even greater losses.  We've already wasted 4 rounds, and it's time to secure a deal."
