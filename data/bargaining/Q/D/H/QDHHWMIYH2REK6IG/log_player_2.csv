"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to secure a deal quickly due to the higher inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems reasonable at first, it's important to consider the inflation rate. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I can potentially get a better deal in the future. It's worth taking the risk and seeing if Alice will be willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can find a split that's more equitable.  Considering the inflation rates, I'm willing to accept a smaller share if it means we can reach an agreement sooner.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to settle this quickly. I'm proposing a split that acknowledges the declining value, but also recognizes my initial willingness to compromise.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is really starting to hurt.  Accepting this offer means I secure a decent amount, even though it's less than my initial hope.  This also avoids the risk of the value continuing to decline in future rounds."
