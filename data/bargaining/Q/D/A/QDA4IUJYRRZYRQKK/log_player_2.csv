"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Understanding the Offer
Alice proposes to split the $100 evenly between us.

## Step 2: Evaluating the Offer
Since the money is split evenly, both of us will receive $50. This seems like a fair offer.

## Step 3: Making a Decision
Given that the offer is fair and there's no apparent reason to reject it in favor of a potentially worse or similar offer in the next round, accepting the offer makes sense.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
