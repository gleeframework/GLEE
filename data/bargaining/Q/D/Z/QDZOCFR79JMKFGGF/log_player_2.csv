"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take 90% and leave you with 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, I think we can find a more agreeable solution.  How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This round is my best offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** The value of the money decreases for me each round, so I need to act quickly to secure a larger portion.
* **Strong Initial Offer:**  By proposing a 70/30 split, I'm aiming high but leaving room for negotiation if Alice rejects it. 
* **Clear Communication:** I'm clearly stating that this is my best offer, putting a sense of urgency on Alice to accept a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 30%.  Let's split it 60/40.  I'm sure we can find common ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out!  This is my final offer: 55/45.  Let's close this deal and both walk away with something.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:** The value is decreasing significantly for me each round. I need to secure a deal now.
* **Compromise but Firm:**  I'm moving closer to a middle ground with the 55/45 split, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but also standing firm on getting a larger share.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept.  She now risks getting a worse deal or even nothing if we don't reach an agreement this round."
