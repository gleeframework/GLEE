{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I propose a fair and simple split. You get 10% and I take the rest. We can end this quickly, or we can play all day - but remember, the money loses value with each round.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 is the only way to ensure we both get a significant portion of the money before it loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
