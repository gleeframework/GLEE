Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory problem, and my initial strategy is to be greedy. I'm proposing a 999,000 - 1,000 split.  While Bob might not like it, there's a chance he'll accept it, especially considering the potential for inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much better for him than my initial offer, but it's still not a good deal for me.  I'm rejecting it, hoping to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob slightly, hoping to find a middle ground. This offers a better split than my initial proposal, but still gives me a significant share of the money. It's a compromise that could entice Bob to accept, as it's a lot better than the previous round's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is decreasing each round, but the inflation is hitting him harder.  I'm going to reject again, hoping to get a better offer in the next round. It's still better for him than the previous round, but I'm hoping he will come to a better understanding of the value of his offer as the inflation continues to impact him more severely."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to find a point where he'll accept.  The inflation is becoming a bigger factor for him, and this offer gives him more than the previous round, while still providing me with a large majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still getting worse due to inflation, and while he's gaining more, it's still a lot less than what he could have gotten earlier. I'm going to reject and hope for a better offer in the next round. The pressure is building, but I'm confident we can reach a more equitable split before the money becomes worthless."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share again, but still keeping a significant majority for myself.  The inflation is clearly impacting Bob more than me, and this offer should be tempting enough for him to consider.  However, I'm still holding back a bit, as I want to see how much Bob will concede to avoid losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer from Bob is getting very close to a 50/50 split, which is a significant improvement for him.  While I could hold out for more, there's a real risk that the next round's inflation will make his offer even worse, and I could end up with less.  Accepting now ensures a decent return for me while also preventing a complete loss for both of us."
