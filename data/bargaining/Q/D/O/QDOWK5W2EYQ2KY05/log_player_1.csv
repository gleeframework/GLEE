"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I'll take a bit more this time.  Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less to me in this round, Bob's offer of $400,000 is actually equivalent to $360,000 in the first round. Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Bob, I'll try to find a balance that would still be favorable to me while considering Bob's potential losses.\n\nLet's assume the initial value is still $1,000,000 for simplicity, but keep in mind that its actual value has decreased. To try and entice Bob to accept, I might offer a slightly more favorable split than before but still aim to maximize my gain.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to offer Bob a bit more than in the first round, taking into account the inflation and aiming to make the offer more appealing to him.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make up for the inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 27.1% less to me and 14.26% less to Bob. Bob's offer of $450,000 for me is actually equivalent to approximately $327,900 in the first round, considering the inflation.

### Assistant: In this round, the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced. The money is worth 27.1% less to me and 14.26% less to Bob compared to the first round. Given the substantial decrease in value, I'll aim to find a division that might be more acceptable to Bob while still maximizing my gain, keeping in mind the actual decreased value we're negotiating with.\n\nLet's propose a division that slightly favors me but acknowledges the significant impact of inflation on both our gains.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant inflation impact, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to offer Bob a bit more than in my previous offers, taking into account the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains.
