Let's see what I can get!  I'll try making a counter offer."

# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice is still offering me less than I offered her, and the money is worth less to me with each round. I'll keep rejecting and see if I can get a better deal in the later rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Since inflation is hitting me hard, I'll offer a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option now, and hopefully, Alice will see that."

Inflation is really hurting me now. I'll accept Alice's offer. It's better than nothing."
