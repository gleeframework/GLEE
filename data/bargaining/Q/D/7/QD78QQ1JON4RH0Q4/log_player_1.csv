"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

This way, I get a decent chunk of the money, but still leave Bob with a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! My share is worth 10% less now.

I'll think about it... Hmm, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine was, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 40% of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next time.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm aiming for a 50-50 split, hoping to make it more attractive for Bob to accept this time."
