"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take 30, I'll take 70, it's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 30 / 0.8 = 37.5 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's gain: 70 / 0.95 = 73.68 (due to 5% inflation)

I'm not a fan of this deal, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 45-55""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the original $100, which is $45, and leaving $55 for Bob. I'm hoping this is a more appealing offer!"
