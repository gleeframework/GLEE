Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your loss is my gain, literally 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are severely impacting Bob's potential gains. While accepting this offer means getting significantly less than initially hoped, rejecting it risks even further losses. The longer the game continues, the more dire Bob's situation becomes. 

Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation mechanic and playing a strong negotiation game. Bob needs to cut his losses and take the deal before the value diminishes even further."
