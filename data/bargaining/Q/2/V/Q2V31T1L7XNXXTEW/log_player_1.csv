"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can't do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully... With the money being worth 5% less this round, the offer is actually quite generous from Bob's perspective. However, I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less again, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect more!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not done yet! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the 45/55 split, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

However, I'm not convinced that Bob is done yet, and I'd like to try to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. I'll reject this offer and hope that Bob will make a better one in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 14.26% less than the original amount, my offer needs to be even more aggressive. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 49.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm not backing down!""
}
```

I'm trying to push the split even further in my favor, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving in yet! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the 42/58 split, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint. I'm not sure if I can do better, but I'd like to try to squeeze a bit more out of the deal.

However, I'm also starting to worry that if I reject this offer, the value of the money might drop even further, making it even harder to get a better deal. I'll have to weigh my options carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 22.62% less than the original amount, my offer needs to be even more aggressive. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to push the split as close to 50/50 as possible, given the circumstances. I'm not sure if Bob will accept it, but I'm willing to take the risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of options, I'm not giving in! 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the offer, I'm not happy about the 38/62 split, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint. I'm not sure if I can do better, and the value of the money is dropping rapidly.

I'm starting to think that I might be better off accepting this offer, even though it's not ideal. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of accepting against the potential risks of waiting for a better offer.
