"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I take 80% of the total amount and Bob takes 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good compromise between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but you have to think it's fair 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is a good deal. I was hoping for a better split, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but you have to meet me halfway""}

I'm adjusting my offer to take a slightly smaller share, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a larger share, but I still want to get a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I want a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer this time. Although the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. Meeting halfway and getting a slight edge for Bob seems like a reasonable compromise, so I'll take it."
