"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""My turn to propose a fairer split. This is better for you than risking further inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's compromise, I've lowered my share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's getting too risky for both of us with the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, I won't go lower 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is severely cutting into Bob's potential gains.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $43 is better than risking another round where the value diminishes further, or even worse, being left with a worse offer in the final round."
