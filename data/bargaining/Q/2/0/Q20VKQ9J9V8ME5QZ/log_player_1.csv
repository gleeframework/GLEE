Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite unfair. Let's be reasonable.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Remember, the clock is ticking and the money is losing value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
