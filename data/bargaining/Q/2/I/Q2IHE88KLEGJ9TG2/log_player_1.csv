"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor that will affect future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting Bob's offer ensures I get $5000, which is better than risking further inflation and getting less in the next round."
