Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, we both get a significant amount""}\n\nI hope Bob accepts this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get the most money and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than this. Since the money is worth less to me with each passing round, I need to try to get more to compensate for the loss in value. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
