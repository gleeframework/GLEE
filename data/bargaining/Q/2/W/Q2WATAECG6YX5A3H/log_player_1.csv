Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a compromise. This offer is still fair, considering the inflation and the limited time remaining. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a potential compromise, it's still heavily skewed in his favor considering the inflation working against me. Accepting now would mean settling for significantly less than half the original value, even though I'm taking on the most risk.  I need to push for a more equitable split while I still have some leverage."
