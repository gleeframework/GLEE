"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting with a fair, but slightly advantageous offer.  Let's see if we can work something out! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, that's a pretty uneven split you're proposing. Let's be more realistic.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split. It benefits us both to settle this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to budge a bit. Let's meet in the middle with a 65/35 split.  This gives you a better share than the first round, and keeps us moving toward an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, the game is still young and the inflation is working in my favor. Accepting now would mean losing out on potential gains if I can push for a more favorable split in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. 50/50 is the fairest option and ensures we both benefit from this deal before inflation eats away at the value.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Pushing for a 60/40 split might be too aggressive now, and risks pushing Alice away from a reasonable agreement.  A 50/50 split is fair, emphasizes the time pressure, and gives us both a good outcome."
