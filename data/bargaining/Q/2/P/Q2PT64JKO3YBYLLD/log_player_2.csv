"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I propose we split it 55/45.  I'm willing to take a little less to get things started. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the value of money decreases by 20% each round, I'd like to try and get a better deal before the money loses its value.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've rejected her offer and it's now my turn to make a proposal. My proposal is: 60/40 in my favor.\n\n# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think a 60/40 split is more reasonable. I'd be willing to take 60 dollars and let Alice have 40 dollars. \n# Bob gain: 60 \n# Alice gain: 40 \n\nLet me know if Alice accepts or rejects my proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'd like to proceed with my proposal.\n\n###\n\nMy proposal is: \n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 60/40 split is more reasonable.""}\n\nPlease let me know if Alice accepts or rejects my proposal!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is a pain, but let's call it even at 50/50.  I think we can both agree that's fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the value of money decreases by 20% each round, and we've already lost 36% of the value, I'd like to try and get a better deal before the money loses its value further.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've rejected her offer and it's now my turn to make a proposal. My proposal is: 65/35 in my favor.\n\n# Bob's message: Given the significant loss in value due to inflation, I think a 65/35 split is more reasonable at this point. I'd be willing to take 65 dollars and let Alice have 35 dollars. \n# Bob gain: 65 \n# Alice gain: 35 \n\nLet me know if Alice accepts or rejects my proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","My proposal is: \n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Given the significant loss in value due to inflation, I think a 65/35 split is more reasonable at this point.""}\n\nPlease let me know if Alice accepts or rejects my proposal!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is making this tough, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 45/55 to avoid further losses.  
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant loss in value due to inflation (59.04% less than the original value), I think accepting this offer is the best option. Further rounds will only lead to more loss in value, and this offer seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nLet Alice know that I've accepted her offer, and we can conclude the game."
