"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is slightly better, time is working against me. I need to push for a more significant gain in the next round or two before the inflation eats away too much of my potential earnings."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real - this back and forth is pointless.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly. Take it before inflation hurts us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 was close, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is getting ridiculous. Alice is clearly trying to squeeze every last dollar out of the deal. While the offer is slowly getting better, accepting now would mean I've lost a significant chunk to inflation. I need to hold firm and show I'm serious about getting a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting absurd. I'm offering you a slight advantage, but this needs to end now. Accept this offer or I walk.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're bluffing, I know you won't walk 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very stubborn and willing to drag this out.  My offer in round 8 was incredibly generous given the circumstances, and she's still pushing for a larger share.  Continuing to refuse offers will likely result in increasingly worse deals for me as the inflation continues to eat away at my potential gains. Accepting now cuts my losses and at least secures a somewhat reasonable amount.  It's better to take a smaller win now than risk ending up with nothing."
