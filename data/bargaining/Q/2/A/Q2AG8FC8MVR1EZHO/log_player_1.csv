"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob. My reasoning is that I want to start with a higher offer for myself, but still leave room for negotiation. I'm also trying to set the tone for the game by suggesting that I'm willing to be fair, but also want to come out on top. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money is losing value each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is losing value each round, I think Bob's offer is still too skewed in his favor. I'm willing to make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money, but I want to try to get a better deal for myself. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll take into account the decreasing value of the money and try to find a middle ground. Since Bob's previous offer was $450,000 for me and $550,000 for him, I'll propose a division of $525,000 for myself and $475,000 for Bob. This way, we're both making a compromise, and I'm trying to create a sense of fairness. Let's see how Bob responds!"
