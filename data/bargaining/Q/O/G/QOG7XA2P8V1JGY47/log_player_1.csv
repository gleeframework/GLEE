"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and it's a fair split. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a bigger share too! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the money, even with the inflation factor. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, I need to be strategic about my next offer. Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split it 55-45. It's still a fair deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not satisfied with the split. You're getting too much! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal.

Considering the inflation, the values are:

Alice's gain: 580,000 (down from 600,000 in round 1)
Bob's gain: 420,000 (down from 400,000 in round 1)

My initial reaction is that this offer is not significantly different from the previous one, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

However, I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to come up with a new offer that takes into account the changing values."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger toll, I need to be even more strategic. Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 52-48. It's getting harder to make ends meet with inflation, but I'm still willing to negotiate.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve more. I'll give you a 50-50 split, but I'm only doing it because I have to. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting desperate, but I'm not sure if I should take the 50-50 split. Considering the inflation, the values are:

Alice's gain: 500,000 (down from 600,000 in round 1)
Bob's gain: 500,000 (down from 400,000 in round 1)

I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 50-50 split. It's not ideal, but it's a fair deal considering the circumstances."
