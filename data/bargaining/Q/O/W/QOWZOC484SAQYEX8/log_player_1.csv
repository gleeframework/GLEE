I'm going for a large share, but I'm giving Bob a decent amount to encourage him to accept. I figure it's better to get something now than risk a smaller share in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it! I'll make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than his previous offer, but still a significant amount.  This is a compromise to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a fair share for myself."
