Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll compromise. 58-42 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer - a 50/50 split.  Let's be fair to each other and end this before inflation eats away at the value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 50/50 is too low. 55-45 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe. While getting a 50/50 split would be ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action for a few reasons:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Waiting any longer means the value of my share will decrease even more significantly. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. Rejecting her offer risks getting even less later.
* **Significant Loss Already:** The difference between 50/50 and 55/45 is significant, but the value has already diminished so much that holding out for a marginal gain isn't worth the risk."
