Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob accepts my fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  In the next round, Bob's offer would be worth even less to him due to inflation, and I would likely get less.  It's time to secure my share!"
