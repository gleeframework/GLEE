"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but I want a fair share.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer this time. His offer is not generous at all, considering the inflation factor. I'll reject it and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not being generous at all! I'll make a better offer next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money still worth 100% for me, but worth 95% for Bob due to inflation, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```"
