Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a greedy opening move, aiming to get the lion's share of the money!  Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a significant amount of money, I believe I can do better. Bob's offer is a bit too generous, and I think he'll be willing to compromise further to avoid another round of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This time, I'm offering a more balanced split.  I'm hoping this will be enough to tempt Bob into accepting, as he's likely feeling the effects of the inflation on his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, I'm accepting this offer.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  While I'd prefer a larger share, it's time to be realistic and secure what I can."
