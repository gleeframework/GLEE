"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60% for me is a good starting point 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Understand the offer
Alice is proposing a division where she takes 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and I get 40%, which is $400,000.

## Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation
Since there's a 10% inflation rate for me with each passing round, if I reject this offer and we proceed to the next round, the money I could potentially gain will be worth 10% less. This means that if I were to propose or receive the same amount in the next round, it would effectively be worth $360,000 to me.

## Step 3: Evaluate the fairness and potential outcomes
Alice's initial offer gives me $400,000, which is a significant amount. However, considering the rules of the game, I have to think about whether accepting this offer now is better than potentially getting a worse deal in the next round due to inflation.

## Step 4: Make a decision
Given the information and the impact of inflation, accepting the offer now seems more beneficial than risking a potentially lower value in the next round.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
