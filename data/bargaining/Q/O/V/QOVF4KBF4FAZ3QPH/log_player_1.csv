"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You get a smaller share, but we can end the game now and get something.""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but it's still a decent offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let's end the game now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the offer is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too generous to Bob. I want a bigger share to compensate for the inflation.""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I need a bigger share to compensate for the inflation. This is my final offer.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to account for the inflation, but I'm not giving up too much. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, the offer is still relatively close to the original split. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""This is a decent compromise, considering the inflation. I'll take it.""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and end the game!"
