400000.0,600000.0,"I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. You can't expect me to give you 50/50 since I'm the one making the proposal now.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,I propose a different division. I believe this offers a better balance considering the diminishing value of our money due to inflation.,Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm not going to give in to your demands just yet. You're still getting a decent share, but I'm trying to hold my ground.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,I think this is a fair compromise given the current situation. It respects the diminishing value of our money while ensuring both of us benefit.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with these offers. I think it's time for a 50/50 split. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a fair division. Let's end this game with a compromise.,Bob,6,
