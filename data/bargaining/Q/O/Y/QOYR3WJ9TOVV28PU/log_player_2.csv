"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good portion. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is decent, it's worth seeing if I can do better. I'll reject and see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we need to factor in.  Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is fair and ensures we both get a significant share. It's better than risking losing everything by continuing to negotiate, especially with the increasing inflation."
