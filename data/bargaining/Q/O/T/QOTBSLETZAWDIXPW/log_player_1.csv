"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, reflecting the higher value loss you'll experience with each round.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially since I'm already experiencing a 20% loss in value. I'd like to propose a different split that takes into account the inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rate, I'm proposing a 50/50 split to ensure we both get a fair share of the remaining value.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
