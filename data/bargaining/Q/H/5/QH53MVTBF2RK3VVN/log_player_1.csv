I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, giving myself $9000 and Bob only $1000.  I figure this will make him think carefully about his next offer if he rejects this one.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to have more, a 50/50 split is fair and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  Let's take it!"
