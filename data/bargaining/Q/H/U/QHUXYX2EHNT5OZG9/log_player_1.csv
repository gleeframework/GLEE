"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth only 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $3200 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a smaller share than I initially proposed, but I'll consider Bob's offer. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced purchasing power.

Since my gain is worth 64% of its original value after two rounds of inflation (80% of 80%), I'll offer a smaller share to account for this decrease.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4500 is now worth only 51.2% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%). 

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide to accept it.
