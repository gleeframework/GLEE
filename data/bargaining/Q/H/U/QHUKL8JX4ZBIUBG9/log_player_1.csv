"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. The message is a friendly nudge to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

For Round 2, I'll have to adjust my decision based on the new values. Since Bob's offer is for $4,000 for me and $6,000 for him, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

I'll reject the offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","For Round 3, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This offer gives me $7,000 and Bob $3,000, which is a slightly more favorable split for me, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer of $5,000 for me and $5,000 for him seems reasonable. Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll accept the offer.
