"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more this time, consider the inflation 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on your side, I'll take more this time 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily becoming more aggressive, leveraging the inflation against me. While the offer is getting worse, I still have time to negotiate. A 30/70 split is heavily in her favor, and I believe I can still secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. Let's be fair and split it evenly.  It's the only way to guarantee we both benefit.""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly using the inflation to her advantage.  Offering a 50/50 split is now the best strategy for these reasons:

* **Simplicity:** It's a clear and understandable offer, removing any complexity from the negotiation.
* **Fairness:** It emphasizes that we both lose due to the inflation, and a fair split is the most logical solution.
* **Urgency:**  With time running out, a 50/50 split offers the highest chance of Alice accepting and us both getting something."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'll take more 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but this offer is getting ridiculous. Accepting 25% of the pot when it's worth so much less for me would be a terrible deal. I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to see if I can get her to be more reasonable. The threat of us both getting nothing might push her to be fairer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Time is running out. This offer is a compromise. Let's settle this now and not risk leaving with nothing.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm acknowledging the time pressure and conceding by offering slightly more than a 50/50 split, which is appealing to Alice.
* **Urgency:** I'm reiterating that time is running out and risking everything is a losing strategy for both of us.
* **Finality:** The tone is firm but compromising, suggesting this is my final offer to avoid reaching a point of no return."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, I'll take most of it 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot. Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation, and this offer is barely acceptable. However, I believe accepting would signal total defeat and she might push even further. There's still a tiny chance she might become reasonable in the face of losing everything. I'm holding out for one more round, hoping she'll offer something better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous.  Accept this offer or we BOTH get NOTHING. This is your last chance.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** It's clear this is the last offer. No more negotiations.
* **Fear:**  The message is designed to make Alice fear getting nothing, which is a real possibility.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 4000 is still much better than 2000 (her last offer), so it could be seen as a small concession to entice her. 

This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If she doesn't accept, we both lose. But the previous rounds have shown she's incredibly greedy, so this might be the only way to salvage something."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're almost out of time, I'll take the lion's share 
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a heartbreaking decision, but I have no choice. Alice is clearly ruthless and unwilling to negotiate fairly. Rejecting this offer means we both get nothing, as she's unlikely to offer anything better in the last round. Accepting this meager amount is the only way to salvage something from this unfair game."
