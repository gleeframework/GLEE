"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. 50/50 split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'm not in a hurry. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly in my favor, but still reasonable. Since the money loses value for Alice, she might be more inclined to accept a slightly worse offer rather than risking further devaluation.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""How about a 55/45 split? Still fairly close, but I think I deserve a bit more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try 4750/5250. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait and see if Alice is willing to give me an even better deal in the next rounds. The current offer is closer to what I want, but I think I can push for a bit more. Let's see how Alice reacts to the increasing pressure of inflation!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make another offer that's slightly more in my favor. Since Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, she might be more willing to accept a deal that's less favorable to her.

{""bob_gain"": 5750, ""alice_gain"": 4250, ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a deal, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about a 57.5/42.5 split?""}"
