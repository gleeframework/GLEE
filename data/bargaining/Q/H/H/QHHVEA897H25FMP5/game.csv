40.0,60.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit one-sided. Let's be fair, I think this split is much more reasonable for both of us.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing rapidly. I'm proposing $65 for me and $35 for you. This is a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, we're getting dangerously close to losing a significant amount to inflation.  This offer is a compromise to ensure we both benefit significantly. Let's be reasonable.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the attempt at compromise, but this offer still heavily favors you.  The value is decreasing rapidly, we need a fairer split to both benefit.",Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my ask again to $60 for me and $40 for you. Let's be realistic, any deal is better than no deal at this point!",Alice,5,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We need to split this evenly before inflation eats away at our potential gains.  50/50 is the only fair option at this point.",Bob,6,
,,"Okay Bob, you win. A 50/50 split it is.",Alice,6,accept
