"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to get a slightly better split. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the effect of inflation. My gain of 35 is worth 9.75% less than the 25 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to 22.56 in the first round's value. Alice's gain of 65 is worth 19% less than the 75 she would have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to 60.75 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I'll accept the offer.
