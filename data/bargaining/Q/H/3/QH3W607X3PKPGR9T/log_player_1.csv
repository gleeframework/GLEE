"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, let's see if we can do better than this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'm hoping to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is worth only $4500 (since it's 10% less than the $6000 I would have gotten in the previous round). 

I don't see any advantage in accepting this offer, since it's a 50-50 split, and I can do better in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now $9,000 (10,000 * 0.9).

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I'm still looking for a better deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain of $4800 is worth $3,456 (since it's 27.1% less than the $6000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is 10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9).

The total amount is now $8,000 (10,000 * 0.9^4).

I'm not sure if this offer is the best I can get, but I'm not sure if I should wait for another round.
