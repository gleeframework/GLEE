"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, you get a smaller share now and I get a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share of 2000$, which is 20% of the initial 10,000$. This way, I'll get the larger share of 8000$, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get something rather than risking going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal share for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll get 5000 * 0.9 = 4500.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather not split it 50/50, I'm hoping for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to get a larger share, considering the money I gain is worth less due to inflation."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
