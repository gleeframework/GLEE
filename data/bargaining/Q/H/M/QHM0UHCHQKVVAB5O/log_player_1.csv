"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering Bob's money depreciates faster."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to try to get a slightly better deal for myself this time. Given the inflation rates, I think this is a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. I'm going to stick to my strategy of offering a more balanced split, hoping to get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, but still trying to get a significant share of the money. With the inflation rates, we both need to be more flexible to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the money is worth less for Bob, it's not enough to justify accepting such a lopsided offer. I'm going to push for a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly smaller increase in Bob's share this round. This might be a good compromise point, as the inflation rates are really starting to affect both of us."
