"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the hassle of further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that we both get less with each passing round.  Let's try this and see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a 60-40 split, but with the opposite split than I initially proposed. Given that the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure a 60/40 split is fair, considering the decreasing value of money. Can we try a 55/45 split instead?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, the total value of the money is now 90% of the original amount. I'll take this into account when making my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value of money, I'm willing to compromise further. Let's try this split and see if we can agree.""
}
```"
