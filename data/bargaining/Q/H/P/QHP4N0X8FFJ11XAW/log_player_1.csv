"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to mirror my previous offer. That's a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, my offer will be worth 20% less than in round 2, due to inflation. Here's my proposal:

I'm offering Bob $520,000 and keeping $480,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
