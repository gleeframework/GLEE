"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 500000 * 0.9 = 450000
* Bob's gain: 500000 * 0.9 = 450000

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
