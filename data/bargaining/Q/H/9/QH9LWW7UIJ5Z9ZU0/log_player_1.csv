Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced offer. I think 60-40 is fair, considering the inflation will affect your share more than mine. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
