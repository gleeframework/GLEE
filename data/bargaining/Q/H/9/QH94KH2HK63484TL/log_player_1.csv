"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the lower amount to start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000. I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the inflation rates. We can both benefit from getting a deal sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, the actual values are:

My gain: $4,000 * 0.95 = $3,800
Bob's gain: $6,000 * 0.9 = $5,400

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems reasonable given the changing values.
