{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round, it's in his best interest to accept this offer rather than risk getting a smaller share in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 800,000, but Bob's share is increasing to 200,000.  Since his money is worth less with each round, this is a better deal for him than the last round's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly worse than the previous round.  While he's gaining a large share,  his money is losing value at a much faster rate. This means he will be receiving less in real terms.  It's better for me to continue playing and see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share again (300,000), which is still less than what I offered in round 3, but his money is worth significantly less now due to inflation. I'm also reducing my own share to 700,000, acknowledging that I need to offer him something to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is still significantly less than what I'd like, it's the best I'm going to get given the inflation rate. Bob is offering a larger share, but it's worth less to him than it would have been in the first round. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting even less in the next round."
