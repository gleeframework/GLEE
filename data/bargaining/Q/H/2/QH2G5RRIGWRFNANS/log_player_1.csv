"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $60 and Bob receiving $40. I've included a message to Bob, ""Let's be fair"", to appeal to his sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer. Since it's the first round, the money is still worth its full value, and I'm hoping to take advantage of that. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even though the money is worth 10% less to me now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. A 45-55 split is not favorable to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get a better offer. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering a 57-43 split, with me receiving $57 and Bob receiving $43. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now due to inflation (10% less in each of the two rounds that have passed), I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept. My message, ""Meet me in the middle"", is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise and fairness. Let's see how he responds!"
