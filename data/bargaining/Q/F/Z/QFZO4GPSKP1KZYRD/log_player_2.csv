Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a reasonable starting point considering the inflation rate.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to look out for myself with this inflation rate. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. It's a smaller margin than your offer, and ensures we both get a reasonable amount before the value diminishes further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
