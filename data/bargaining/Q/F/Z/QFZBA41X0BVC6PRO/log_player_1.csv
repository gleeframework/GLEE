"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 and keep 60. You can do better than this?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60, and I'm hoping he'll think it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split. Your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob taking 70, as it's a significant portion of the remaining money. I'll try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too generous for you, I think I'll try to get a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a significant share, but I'm willing to give you a small amount. Don't expect more! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting me hard! With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll have to be very careful.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as I'd like to get a bit more than 20. However, I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob's message suggests he's not willing to budge much. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, I'll take the 20, but I'm not happy about it.""
}
```"
