"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only Round 1, and I'm not worried about inflation yet.\n\nYour turn, Alice! Make your next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since Alice is losing 10% of the value each round, I'll try to take advantage of that.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""You're losing value faster than me, so I think 55/45 is a better split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we meet in the middle a bit? This deal gets us both something. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. The value of the money is decreasing, but I still think I can get a better deal. Alice is losing value faster than me, so I'll try to use that to my advantage.\n\nLet's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since Alice is losing value even faster now, I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Time is on my side, and inflation is hitting you harder. I think 58/42 is a fair split considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm feeling the pressure. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal and both go home with something. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Alice, I think this offer is reasonable. It's Round 5, and the value is decreasing rapidly. I'll accept this offer to ensure I get something rather than risking further devaluation or even getting nothing if we reach the 12th round without an agreement.\n\nLet's close the deal!"
