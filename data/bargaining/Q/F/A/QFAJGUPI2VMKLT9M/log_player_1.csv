"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you 40 dollars, which is a relatively small share, hoping you'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is now worth 50% of its original value, which is 50 * 0.9 = 45 dollars. Since Bob's gain is still 50 dollars, which is worth 50 dollars, this is a good deal for me. I accept the offer.
