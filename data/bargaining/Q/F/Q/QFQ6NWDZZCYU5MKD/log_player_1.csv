"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split in Bob's favor, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and propose a new one:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60-40 split. How about we try 55-45 in my favor? It's still a compromise, but I think it's a better starting point.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm still open to a compromise. This 55-45 split is a fair middle ground. Let's see if we can make a deal.""}

I'm sticking to my initial proposal of 55-45, hoping Bob will accept this time."
