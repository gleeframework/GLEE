"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself. Since I know there's inflation, I'm going to see if I can negotiate a higher share later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still open to a compromise. This 55-45 split is a fair middle ground. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, with the inflation impacting my gains significantly, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. Accepting this offer gives me some money, and I can always try to negotiate better terms in the future."
