Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll try to meet you halfway, but I still think I can get more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the deal is still significantly better for me due to the inflation hitting her harder each round.  I believe I can push for a better deal in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the deal is getting worse for you every round. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my asking price slightly to take advantage of the worsening situation for Alice. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to add pressure and increase the likelihood of her accepting. It's a gamble, but the potential reward of a larger share outweighs the risk of her rejecting at this stage."
