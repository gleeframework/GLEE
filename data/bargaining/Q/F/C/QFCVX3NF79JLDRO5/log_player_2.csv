Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that the value is decreasing, but she's using that to try and lowball me. I need to hold out for a better deal, but I need to be mindful of the rapidly decreasing value."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is dropping fast.  While this isn't a great deal, it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic, and waiting longer is likely to result in even worse offers from her."
