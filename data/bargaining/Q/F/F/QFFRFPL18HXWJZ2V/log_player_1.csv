"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself, hoping it's a reasonable starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 450k, but I think I deserve more. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully... I'm not too thrilled about giving up 550,000$, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round with a lower value of money. I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit. How about 550k for me and 450k for you? It's a 50-50 split, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep a slight edge for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully... I'm still not thrilled about giving up 480,000$, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'll decide to...
