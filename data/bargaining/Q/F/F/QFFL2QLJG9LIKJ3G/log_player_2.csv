"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to secure a good amount before inflation diminishes its value. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is generous, it's in my best interest to try and get a larger share.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe we can find a more equitable split that benefits us both. Let's aim for a 60/40 split, keeping in mind that the value of the money will decrease for me with each passing round.  Let's make this a win-win situation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a 60/40 split, but time is working against you.  This offer is a compromise, recognizing the diminishing value you face with each round. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the decreasing value of the money makes this a reasonable deal. It's better to secure a decent amount now than to risk losing even more in the next round."
