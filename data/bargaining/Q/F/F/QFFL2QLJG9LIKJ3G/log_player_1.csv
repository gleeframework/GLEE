Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe we can find a more equitable split that benefits us both. Let's aim for a 60/40 split, keeping in mind that the value of the money will decrease for me with each passing round.  Let's make this a win-win situation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
