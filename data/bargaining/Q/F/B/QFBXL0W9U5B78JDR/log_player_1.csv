"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start fairly, 60-40?""}###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's start fairly, 60-40?"" is a friendly and inviting way to begin the game, suggesting that we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. By framing it as a question, I'm also leaving room for Bob to respond and make a counteroffer if he's not satisfied with the initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I'll take 60% this time. It's a fair trade, right? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, the value of the money I would gain is now 10% less than in the first round, making the 40% offer ($4000) even less valuable. Additionally, I initially offered a 60-40 split in my favor, and Bob is now offering the same split but in his favor, which doesn't seem like a compromise. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 58-42?""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob also made an offer. By suggesting a 58-42 split, I'm trying to find a middle ground between our previous proposals. The message ""Meet me in the middle, 58-42?"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise, encouraging him to accept this offer or make a more reasonable counteroffer."
