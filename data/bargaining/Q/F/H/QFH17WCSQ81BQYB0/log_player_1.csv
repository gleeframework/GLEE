"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a fair offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and not risk the chance of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's better to take the deal now rather than risk further inflation and potentially get a worse offer in the next round."
