"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try something more realistic 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, I didn't expect Bob to be so... optimistic about his chances.

Considering the new offer, I'll have to adjust my decision. With the 20% inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth $160,000, and Bob's gain of $800,000 is still worth $800,000.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for Round 3!

Considering the 20% inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of its original value (1 - 0.2^2). So, if I were to take 50% of the original amount, I'd be getting 64% of $500,000, which is $320,000.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $680,000 and keeping $320,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's getting aggressive!

Let's calculate the value of my gain in this round. The 20% inflation in the first round, followed by another 20% inflation, is equivalent to a total inflation of 1.2. Since I started with $700,000, the value of my gain in the first round was $700,000. Now, with the additional 20% inflation, my gain is worth $700,000 * 0.8 = $560,000.

Considering the 48.8% inflation from the first round to this round, my gain is now worth $560,000 * 0.516 = $288,768.

With Bob's offer, I'd be getting $100,000, which is worth $100,000. It's a relatively small amount compared to what I could have gotten in previous rounds.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for Round 5!

Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 41.6% of its original value (1 - 0.2^3). So, if I were to take 40% of the original amount, I'd be getting 41.6% of $400,000, which is $166,400.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 166400,
  ""bob_gain"": 833600,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a compromise, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $833,600 and keeping $166,400 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to nothing, I'm getting everything 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's getting ruthless!

Let's calculate the value of my gain in this round. The 20% inflation in the first round, followed by another 20% inflation, and then another 20% inflation, is equivalent to a total inflation of 1.44. Since I started with $700,000, the value of my gain in the first round was $700,000. Now, with the additional 20% inflation, my gain is worth $700,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $448,000.

Considering the 67.23% inflation from the first round to this round, my gain is now worth $448,000 * 0.3248 = $145,747.84.

With Bob's offer, I'd be getting $50,000, which is worth $50,000. It's a tiny fraction of what I could have gotten in previous rounds.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for Round 7!

Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 25.6% of its original value (1 - 0.2^4). So, if I were to take 25% of the original amount, I'd be getting 25.6% of $400,000, which is $102,400.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 102400,
  ""bob_gain"": 897600,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a decent split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $897,600 and keeping $102,400 for myself. This is my last attempt to get a fair share, and I'm hoping Bob will see reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're almost out of money, I'm taking the rest 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's getting aggressive!

Let's calculate the value of my gain in this round. The 20% inflation in the first round, followed by another 20% inflation, and then another 20% inflation, and then another 20% inflation, is equivalent to a total inflation of 1.78. Since I started with $700,000, the value of my gain in the first round was $700,000. Now, with the additional 20% inflation, my gain is worth $700,000 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $358,400.

Considering the 79.03% inflation from the first round to this round, my gain is now worth $358,400 * 0.2083 = $74,755.20.

With Bob's offer, I'd be getting $1,000, which is worth $1,000. It's a tiny fraction of what I could have gotten in previous rounds.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'm not going to give up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for Round 9!

Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 16.64% of its original value (1 - 0.2^5). So, if I were to take 15% of the original amount, I'd be getting 16.64% of $333,333.33, which is $55,555.55.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55555,
  ""bob_gain"": 944445,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to show some mercy, Bob!""
}

I'm offering Bob $944,445 and keeping $55,555.55 for myself. This is my last attempt to get a decent share, and I'm hoping Bob will show some compassion."
