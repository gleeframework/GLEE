"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $550,000, and leave $450,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering the potential for inflation later in the game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 in this round is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $427,500 in value. And Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $440,000 in value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I can do better than this, let's keep negotiating.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation. My gain of $427,500 in this round is worth 95% of what it was in the second round, so it's actually $404,625 in value. And Bob's gain of $440,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the second round, so it's actually $352,000 in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to maximize my gain.""
}
```"
