"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose we take a larger share now while the money is worth more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth more in the earlier rounds, I should aim to get a larger share or wait for a better offer. Accepting 40% of the money in the first round might not be the best option, as I might be able to negotiate for more in the subsequent rounds. Additionally, the 10% decrease in the money's value for me is a significant consideration, so I should try to maximize my gain early on. By rejecting the offer, I'll get a chance to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI will make a counteroffer to Alice, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us. Since Alice offered me 40% in the previous round, I'll try to find a middle ground that benefits me more while still being reasonable for Alice. Given the inflation rates, I should aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value over the rounds.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 57-43 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share, but I compensate for the higher devaluation on my end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm slightly increasing my share to account for the time pressure. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Alice's new offer is even less favorable than the first one, with me receiving only 38% of the money. Considering the inflation, this offer is actually worse than the initial one because the money is now worth 19% less to me. I should continue to negotiate for a better deal, as accepting this offer would mean I'm losing more value over time. By rejecting, I'll have another chance to make a counteroffer or see if Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","The game is heating up! Since Alice increased her share in the previous offer, I'll try to counter with a slightly more aggressive offer, while still being mindful of the decreasing value of money for both of us. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value over the rounds.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the time pressure, but I need to account for the higher inflation on my end. A 60-40 split is more reasonable, considering the value of money is decreasing faster for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! This back and forth is pointless.  Accept this offer and let's both leave with something! 
# Bob gain: 37 
# Alice gain: 63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Alice's offer is still not favorable to me, and the inflation is taking a significant toll on the value of the money. Accepting 37% of the money now would mean I'm losing a substantial amount of value compared to the initial rounds. Since we still have a few rounds left, I should continue to negotiate for a better deal. By rejecting, I'll have another chance to make a counteroffer or see if Alice is willing to compromise further. It's also possible that Alice is getting anxious about the time pressure, so I might be able to use that to my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","We're getting closer to the deadline, and the inflation is taking a significant toll on the value of the money. Since Alice is getting anxious about the time pressure, I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer to take advantage of the situation. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value over the rounds.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're running out of time, but I need to prioritize my own gain due to the higher inflation on my end. A 62-38 split is my final reasonable offer. If you reject, I'll have to assume you're willing to risk getting nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising.  This is less than I offered before, but more than you've offered. We're running out of time to make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although Alice claims to be compromising, the offer is still not favorable to me. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and accepting 38% of the money now would mean I'm losing a substantial amount of value compared to the initial rounds. Since we still have a few rounds left, I should continue to negotiate for a better deal. By rejecting, I'll have another chance to make a counteroffer or see if Alice is willing to compromise further. It's also possible that Alice is getting desperate about the time pressure, so I might be able to use that to my advantage in the next round."

Round 8

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is ridiculous! I'm meeting you in the middle one last time. Take it or leave it - we're down to the wire! 
# Bob gain: 37 
# Alice gain: 63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although Alice claims to be meeting me in the middle, the offer is still not favorable to me. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and accepting 37% of the money now would mean I'm losing a substantial amount of value compared to the initial rounds. Since we still have a few rounds left, I should continue to negotiate for a better deal. By rejecting, I'll have another chance to make a counteroffer or see if Alice is willing to compromise further. It's also possible that Alice is getting extremely anxious about the time pressure, so I might be able to use that to my advantage in the next round. However, I should also consider the risk of not reaching a deal and getting nothing, so I'll need to think carefully about my next move."
