,,,Bob,1,reject
43.0,57.0,"Considering the inflation, I think a 57-43 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share, but I compensate for the higher devaluation on my end.",Bob,2,

62.0,38.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm slightly increasing my share to account for the time pressure. Let's close this deal now.",Alice,3,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I understand the time pressure, but I need to account for the higher inflation on my end. A 60-40 split is more reasonable, considering the value of money is decreasing faster for me.",Bob,4,
