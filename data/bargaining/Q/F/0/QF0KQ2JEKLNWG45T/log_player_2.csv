**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is strategically sound for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** Every round, Alice loses more value from the initial sum due to inflation.  While Bob's value remains constant, waiting for a significantly better offer in later rounds is risky. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** The difference between Alice's current offer and Bob's previous one is small.  Holding out for a slightly larger gain isn't worth the risk of Alice making even lower offers as her potential gains diminish. 
* **Securing a Win:**  Accepting guarantees Bob a share above the 50/50 split he'd get in a perpetually stalled negotiation. 

It's a compromise, but in a game with diminishing returns and time pressure, sometimes securing a good win is preferable to an ideal, but uncertain, outcome."
