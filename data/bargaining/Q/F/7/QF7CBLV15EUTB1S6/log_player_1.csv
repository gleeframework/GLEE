Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting into a pattern here.  Let's cut the time wasted and split it 60/40.  This way, we both get a good amount, and we're done with this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to wear me down by repeating his initial offer. It's important to show him I'm serious about getting a fairer share, especially as time (and the value of the money) is running out."
