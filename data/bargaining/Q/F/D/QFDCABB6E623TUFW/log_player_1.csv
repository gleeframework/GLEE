Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of the original amount, which is $4,000. And Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of the original amount, which is $4,500.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather try to get a better deal.
