"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer gives Alice 60% of the money, which is not a fair split in my opinion. I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better deal in the next round, despite the 5% decrease in value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split.""}\n\nI've made an offer that gives me 55% of the money and Alice 45%. Given the inflation rates, I believe this is a reasonable proposal. Since the money is worth 5% less to me and 10% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer to minimize her losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the inflation rates, the money is worth 9.75% less to me and 19% less to Alice compared to the first round. I believe this is a fair offer, and continuing the game would only result in further losses for both of us. It's better to accept this offer and end the game now."
