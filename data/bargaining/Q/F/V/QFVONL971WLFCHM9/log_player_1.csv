"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In the second round, the total value of the money is 80% of the original amount (1 - 0.2 = 0.8). So, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 300,000 * 0.8 = 240,000
Bob gain: 700,000 * 0.9 = 630,000

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, the money is worth 64% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $600,000, which is 60% of the reduced amount, and I'll take the remaining $400,000."
