Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer to my limit 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but this offer is still not good for us.  We need to hold strong and push for a more favorable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it, a 50/50 split. Take it before it's too late for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Time to play hardball. We've rejected several offers, showing we're serious. Offering an even split seems fair, but crucially highlights that *any* further delay hurts Alice more than us. This might be our best shot at getting Alice to agree before the shrinking pot makes it pointless."
