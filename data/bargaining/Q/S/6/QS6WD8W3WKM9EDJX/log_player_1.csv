"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 
I propose to keep 9000$ for myself, and give 1000$ to Bob. I believe this is a fair initial offer, leaving a good amount for Bob while securing a substantial portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer to keep more, the inflation factor makes this offer attractive. A 50/50 split is fair considering the diminishing value of the money."
