"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the total amount. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's split it 50/50 and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'd rather wait for a better offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for a 50/50 split just yet. Let's see if Bob has a better offer for Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, Bob. But I still think this is a fair split considering the current market conditions.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or make a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, Alice. I think this is a good compromise considering the current market conditions. 
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I think this offer is a good compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:
