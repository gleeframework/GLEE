"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fairer split. Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to take a bigger share of the pie!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... 

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 2:3 split just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 2:3, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more in my favor. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I'm hoping this is a more balanced split that Bob will be willing to accept!"
