I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since it's the first round, I'm trying to maximize my share while still offering Bob something.  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share,  I'm taking a 50/50 split. It's better than getting 80% of a smaller pie in the next round due to inflation."
