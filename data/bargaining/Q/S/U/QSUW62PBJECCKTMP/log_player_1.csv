"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish.""
}
```

This offer gives me $80 and Bob $20, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given your offer in the previous round.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $80 is now worth $72, and Bob's $20 is still worth $20.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do better than the previous round, but I'm not convinced by the 60/40 split. I'll reject this offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""60/40 is a bit too skewed. Let's try again.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my $72 is now worth $64.40 (72 * 0.9).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split this time. Consider it.""
}
```"
