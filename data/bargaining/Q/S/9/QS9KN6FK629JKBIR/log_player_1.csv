"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with each of us getting $600,000. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and we can work from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, Alice. Let's move towards that. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in Round 2, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 450,000 x 0.9 = 405,000
* Bob gain: 550,000 x 0.9 = 495,000

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split it 50/50.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. I'm hoping this will be more to Bob's liking."
