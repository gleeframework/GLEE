"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I'll get a decent amount, but still leave room for Bob to negotiate or accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a mirror image of my previous offer, but with the gains swapped. Since I'm not getting a better deal than my original offer, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was a mirror image of mine, I'll try to make a different proposal. Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This time, I'll try to give Bob a slightly smaller share, while keeping a larger share for myself."
