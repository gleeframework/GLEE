```

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 20 is now worth less than 20. I'll have to think carefully.

}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous rounds, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Since my gain is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a larger share.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, given the inflation, I think this is a fair adjustment 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a big hit! With my gain worth 27.1% less than in the first round, 10 is not as appealing as it used to be.

```
