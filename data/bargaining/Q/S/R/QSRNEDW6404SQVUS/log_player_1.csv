"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a very aggressive first offer, leaving Bob with only $1.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a very small amount, or if he's going to try to negotiate.  The inflation is likely to work in my favor if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep more, it's important to remember that the money is worth the same for me, but Bob is already losing value with inflation.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and any further rounds only risk losing some of that."
