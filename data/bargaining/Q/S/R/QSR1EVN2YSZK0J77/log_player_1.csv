"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being a bit greedy, aren't you? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I feel that the 20-80 split is too skewed in Bob's favor. I was hoping for a more balanced split, especially considering the money is worth less in this round due to inflation. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 45-55""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a more balanced split compared to the previous rounds. I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share to move the negotiation forward."
