"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the compromise, but the inflation is working against me.  I'm proposing a 56/44 split. It's a better deal than you'll get in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600
