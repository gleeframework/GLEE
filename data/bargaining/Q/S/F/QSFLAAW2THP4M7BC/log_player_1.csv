"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's work together to find a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to trick me into accepting the same offer again! But I'm not falling for it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're just repeating the same offer. I want a better deal. I'll give you a chance to come up with something new.""
}
```

I'm not accepting the same offer as before. I'm hoping Bob will come up with a new proposal that takes into account the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to take its toll. The money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so the total amount is now 9,000$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more. I'll take 5500, and you can have 4500. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but I still want to get a good deal."
