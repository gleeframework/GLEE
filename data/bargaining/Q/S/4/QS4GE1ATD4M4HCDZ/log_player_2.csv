While the inflation hurts me more, accepting this offer is the best option. If I reject it, Alice will make the next proposal, and with each round the value of the money decreases for me even further, making it more likely that I will be left with less. It's better to accept this offer and secure a portion of the money now, rather than risk ending up with nothing."
