Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, since the inflation will impact both of us in later rounds. This way we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
