"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.  Let's see if he's willing to split the pot early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's a 50/50 split, I'm confident I can do better in the next round, especially with inflation in effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy as round 1, but adjust the offer slightly to account for the inflation and Bob's rejection of my previous offer.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept before the value of the money continues to decline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  Although the inflation is hitting hard, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll continue to negotiate and try to secure a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again to account for the continued inflation. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. The inflation is really taking its toll, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'm going to keep trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

The inflation is getting scary now.  I'm reducing my share slightly again but hoping Bob will see that it's better than getting nothing at all.  We're getting close to the end, so I need to make a move that will get us to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  It's a very unbalanced split, and while the inflation is a serious threat, I believe I can still secure a better outcome by continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to stick to my strategy of offering a slightly lower share each round, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. Inflation is getting out of control, and I need to reach an agreement quickly.  We're both losing value with every passing round, so I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer and avoid further risk."
