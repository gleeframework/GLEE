"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a hefty share, but I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate if Bob isn't happy with it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still a significant drop from my initial proposal. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. While the inflation has impacted my earnings, I'm still willing to compromise and offer Bob a fair share. This should be a more appealing proposition than the previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  It's not ideal, but it's a decent amount considering the circumstances.  Further negotiation likely won't yield a better result, and I risk losing everything if we keep rejecting offers."
