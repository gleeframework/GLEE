Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing rapidly, Bob. I'll take a bit more than half now, or this deal won't be worth it for me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### The offer isn't ideal, but considering the rapid decrease in value for me and the fact that Alice's gain remains constant, accepting this seems like the best option to secure some value before it devalues further."
