"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get a nice chunk of money, but still leave Bob with a significant amount to make the game worth playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more careful. Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if I should take it.

I'll reject the offer for now and see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 5% less than in Round 2 due to inflation. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
