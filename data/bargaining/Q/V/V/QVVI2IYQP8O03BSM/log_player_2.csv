Let's see what Alice proposes next! I'm not going to accept such an uneven split right away."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's try a 50/50 split.  This seems like a fair starting point, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
