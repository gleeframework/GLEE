"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I want to maximize my share in the first round. I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. 

This is a somewhat aggressive offer, but since I don't know how Bob will react to the inflation, I'm aiming for a large initial share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:** While my share has decreased by 5%, Bob's share has decreased by a significant 10%. This means the current offer is more favorable for me than it was for him in the previous round.
* **Fairness:** The offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome. 
* **Risk:** Continuing the game means another round of inflation, potentially further decreasing my share. Accepting the offer guarantees a substantial amount. 

Therefore, accepting the offer is the best choice, considering the inflation and the potential risks of playing another round."
