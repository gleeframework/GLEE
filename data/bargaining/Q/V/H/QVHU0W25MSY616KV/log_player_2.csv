"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this round, but I'm open to a more even split later. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take the 10,000, it's a very small percentage of the total. Rejecting this offer gives Bob the opportunity to make a proposal in the next round and potentially get a much larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 495000, ""alice_gain"": 505000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'll take a slightly smaller share this time to show I'm willing to compromise. If we can keep splitting things relatively evenly, we can both walk away with a substantial amount.""}
