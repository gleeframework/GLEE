"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take a slightly smaller share this time to show I'm willing to compromise. If we can keep splitting things relatively evenly, we can both walk away with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
