"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

My gain of $4,500 is worth 90% of the original $6,000, which is $4,200. Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 95% of the original $4,000, which is $4,950.

I'll reject this offer.
