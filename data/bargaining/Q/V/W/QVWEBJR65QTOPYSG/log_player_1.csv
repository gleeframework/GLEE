"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose a division where I receive $999,999 and Bob receives $1. This ensures I get the majority of the money, and there's a small chance Bob might accept it, especially if he doesn't understand the inflation aspect yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Bob's offer is significantly better than the first round, and the inflation factor means that if I reject this, I risk getting even less in future rounds."
