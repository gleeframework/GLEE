Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me most of the money. I figure Bob might accept it, but if he doesn't, I'll adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, inflation makes this a good deal. I'm guaranteed 50% of the remaining money, which is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
