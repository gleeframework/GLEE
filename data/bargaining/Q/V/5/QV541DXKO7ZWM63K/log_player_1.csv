"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep 9000$ and give Bob 1000$.  I'm hoping to maximize my share in the first round, as the inflation will affect me more in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation will make my share worth significantly less in the next round. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee a reasonable payout."
