"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60-40, I'll give you 55-45, is that fair? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to squeeze me out, eh?

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 55-45 split, considering the initial offer was 60-40. I think I'll hold out for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to counter Bob's 55-45 offer with a new proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle at 50-50, no more negotiating!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which should be a more reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
