Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose with every round. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Bob. This puts pressure on him to make a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Waiting any longer means a significantly smaller pot for both of us. 
* **Bob's Stance:**  His language (""final offer"", ""realistic"") suggests he's unlikely to offer more.

Accepting 60% now is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
