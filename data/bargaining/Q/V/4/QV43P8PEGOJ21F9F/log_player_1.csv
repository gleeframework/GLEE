I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep more money, the inflation will only hurt me further if I reject this offer. This deal still gives me a sizable sum, and I'm not confident I could negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
