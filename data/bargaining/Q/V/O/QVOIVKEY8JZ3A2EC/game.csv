4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, the inflation is affecting your gains more than mine. I'm willing to make a deal, but I think this split is more reasonable considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the time pressure and the decreasing value.  Let's close the deal.",Alice,5,
