"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fair initial offer, splitting the money evenly. I want to see how Bob reacts to this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'll counter with a better offer for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to account for the inflation, but still offering a reasonable split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though inflation is really hurting me now, Bob's offer is still better than what I would get if we keep going.  I'll take it."
