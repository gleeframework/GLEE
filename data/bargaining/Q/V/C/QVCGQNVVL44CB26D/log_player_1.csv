"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the potential for inflation to eat away at my share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is more equitable than my first one, it still undervalues my share, especially with the inflation factor kicking in. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counter with my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly but still offering Bob a fair amount. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that accounts for inflation and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to have a serious impact on the value of the money.  Bob's offer, while still unfavorable, is the best I'm likely to get at this point. It's time to secure something before the value drops even further."
