"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fair split, considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist on Bob's part! Considering the inflation rates, his offer seems more reasonable now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on 55-45, considering the inflation hit I'll take.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
