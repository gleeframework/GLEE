"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a generous offer, giving Bob a significant portion of the money, but I'm keeping the majority for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, taking a larger share of the money, but I suppose it's a good opportunity to get something out of this game.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
