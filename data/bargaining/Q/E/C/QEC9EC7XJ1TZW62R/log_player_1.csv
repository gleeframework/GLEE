"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that was a pretty lopsided offer. Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split.  Take it or leave it, the value for both of us decreases with each round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
