"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if we can do better than that 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4000 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is meeting me in the middle, I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
