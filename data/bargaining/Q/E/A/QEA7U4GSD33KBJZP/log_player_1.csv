"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems fair, considering that Bob's share will be worth less with the inflation rate.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While it's true that the money is worth less now, Bob's proposal is drastically unfair. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a lopsided deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to compromise and offer a 70/30 split in my favor. This takes into account the inflation, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, it's still too heavily in his favor. I'm not willing to accept such a low share, especially considering the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money.  I'm hoping we can find a more balanced solution in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split.  It's a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the inflation we've both faced. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still not ideal, given the inflation, it's now a fair and balanced split, and I'm willing to accept it to finally end this game."
