"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can have 30% 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since my gain would be 30, which is 30% of the current total, and Bob's gain would be 70, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll decide to reject this offer. My next move will be to try to get a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""You took 70 last round, now it's my turn to take the lead!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, with me getting a larger share this time. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 40 last round, now it's my turn to take a bigger lead 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! My gain is worth significantly less now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 15/85 split, but I have to think about the bigger picture. If I reject this offer, I might end up with nothing if we reach the 12th round.

I'll decide to accept this offer. I'll take the 15 and hope that I can do better in future rounds.
