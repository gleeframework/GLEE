I propose keeping 9000 dollars and giving Bob 1000 dollars. This leaves some room for negotiation in future rounds if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 8000, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  I'm willing to give up more in future rounds if necessary, but I think this is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the previous one, it's still not fair considering the inflation.  I'm hoping we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but I'm still aiming for a fair split.  It's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers as the inflation takes its toll."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  The inflation is becoming a serious factor, but I believe we can still find a more balanced solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Inflation is becoming a major concern. I'm offering a significant concession to Bob, hoping he will accept. This is getting risky, as the value of the money keeps shrinking."
