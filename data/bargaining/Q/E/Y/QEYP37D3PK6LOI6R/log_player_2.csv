"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive rounds. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable, given that inflation will impact you more heavily in the next round. Let's settle this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be mindful of the inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share,  a 55/45 split is a fair compromise considering the inflation factor."
