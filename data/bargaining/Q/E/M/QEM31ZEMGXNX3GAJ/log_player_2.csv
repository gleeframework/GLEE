"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering the money will be worth less with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

It's a good starting point, but I'm going to try to get a better deal!  The money is depreciating faster for me, so I need to be aggressive early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's get this done quickly to avoid losing too much value! ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need a larger share due to the inflation affecting me less. Let's split it 54/46 this time. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's still a loss for me, but the inflation is getting out of hand.  Better to take what I can get and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
