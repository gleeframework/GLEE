I'm going to propose a split that favors me slightly, but gives Bob something. Hopefully, he'll see that it's better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. It's pretty unfair, and I know I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split this time. I think a 55/45 split is fair, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise."
