"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the effects of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the effects of inflation in mind, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer from Round 4.

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
