"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. My message is a friendly reminder that this is a good deal for both of us!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I need to reassess the offer. 

The original $1,000,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so the effective amounts are:

Alice gain: $600,000 * 0.8 = $480,000
Bob gain: $400,000 * 0.9 = $360,000

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $550,000. My message is a friendly suggestion to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting lowball, I'm calling the shots now! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! With the reduced value of money, I need to reassess the offer. 

The original $1,000,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, but due to the increased inflation rate, it's actually worth 80% * 0.768 (1 - 0.232) = 61.44% of its original value.

The effective amounts are:

Alice gain: $600,000 * 0.6164 = $369,84
Bob gain: $400,000 * 0.7279 = $291,16

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no more haggling!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $500,000, and I'll take the remaining $500,000. My message is a straightforward proposal to split the money evenly."
