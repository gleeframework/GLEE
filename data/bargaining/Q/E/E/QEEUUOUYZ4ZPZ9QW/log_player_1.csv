"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 

I'll start by being generous and giving Bob a small portion, hoping to incentivize him to accept quickly. We'll see how this plays out with the inflation factor!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split in the second round is the most sensible option.  There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better in the future, and with each round, the value of the money decreases. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing later."
