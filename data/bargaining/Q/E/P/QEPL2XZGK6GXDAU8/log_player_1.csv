"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority, but I want to keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less, so I'll consider the actual amounts I'll gain as follows:

* Alice gain: 70 * 0.8 = 56
* Bob gain: 30 * 0.8 = 24

I'm not too thrilled about giving Bob a majority, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.
