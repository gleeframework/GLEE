"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split. This seems fair as I will be losing more value per round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering an 8000/2000 split, recognizing that the inflation will affect me more than Bob.  This should incentivize him to accept, as he'll be getting more than he did in the previous round, while the inflation will still be relatively low for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still losing value much faster than Bob, and I'm willing to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a 7000/3000 split.  The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I'm still hoping to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though the inflation is hurting me severely, I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, but I'm willing to risk it for a little more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm still trying to secure a decent share. I'm offering a 6000/4000 split. This should be a good compromise given the current inflation rates."
