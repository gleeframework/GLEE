Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share of the money (900,000$) while still offering Bob a decent amount (100,000$). It's a good starting point, and I hope Bob will see it as fair enough to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  

* **My gain is significantly reduced due to inflation, making this offer more appealing than waiting for my turn.** 
* **There's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything better in the future, especially with his gain also being inflated.**
* **With 10 rounds left, the risk of losing everything is too high.** 

It's not ideal, but securing 500,000$ is better than risking it all."
