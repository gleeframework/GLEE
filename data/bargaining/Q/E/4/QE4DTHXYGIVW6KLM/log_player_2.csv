"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share.  Accept this and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not going to accept a 10% share right off the bat. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a good amount, and we can both walk away with a substantial sum.  No need to push our luck.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than your last offer.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the future. It's better to take what I can get before the money keeps shrinking."
