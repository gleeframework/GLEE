"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide the money in a way that benefits both of us. I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally. We've both lost some value due to inflation, so I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is technically ""fair"" in a vacuum, it doesn't consider the faster rate of devaluation she faces. I need to leverage this to secure a better deal for myself in the coming rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want an even split, but the declining value makes that tricky. I'm proposing a split that reflects the reality of our situation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly increasing my share from the previous offer.  This keeps the pressure on Alice, who sees her potential gains shrinking rapidly with each passing round. While I'm aiming high, I'm also leaving room for negotiation if needed as we approach the later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing loss of value, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share to compensate for the higher depreciation on my end. This is still a relatively fair split. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the value disparity, but her offer is still not favorable enough.  While the money is losing value for both of us, she's losing it much faster. I need to hold out for a deal that reflects this disparity more accurately.  The pressure is mounting as we approach the halfway point, but I'm betting Alice will become more amenable to a less favorable split as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 620000,
""alice_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is slipping away with each round. This offer secures a good portion for you considering the devaluation, and allows us to both walk away with something substantial.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my stake again. This serves two purposes:

* **Increased Pressure:**  Alice is feeling the heat of the shrinking pie, especially as we pass the halfway mark. This offer, while favoring me, still gives her a considerable sum, particularly when factoring in the devaluation she'd experience in later rounds. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While this offer is bold, it provides space for me to potentially decrease my share in later rounds, appearing more ""conciliatory"" if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the significant loss of value on my end, I'm adjusting my offer to ensure I don't end up with less than what's fair. This split still gives Bob a substantial amount considering the lower depreciation on his end. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offer still doesn't reflect the true devaluation she faces.  We're now past the halfway point, and while the total value is decreasing, my leverage is increasing.  By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to risk it all for a more favorable split in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm aiming for a win-win here, but we need to be realistic. This offer gives you a decent share considering how much value is eroding with each passing moment.  Let's close this deal and avoid going empty-handed.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my share again, taking advantage of Alice's increasingly desperate position. With time running out, she'll be weighing the value of a smaller share against the risk of getting nothing at all. 

* **Urgency and ""Reasonableness"":** The message is crafted to instill a sense of urgency while maintaining a facade of fairness. I'm emphasizing the ""loss aversion"" aspect – it's better to take a smaller share than risk getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, and the value is decreasing rapidly for me. Given the circumstances, I believe this split is necessary to compensate for the significant loss I'm facing. It still offers Bob a considerable amount. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire, and Alice is finally feeling the heat!  Her offer is better, but it's still not enough to offset the significant devaluation she's experiencing. I'm betting she'll crack under pressure in the next round or two and offer a much more favorable split to avoid getting nothing. I'm willing to gamble for a better outcome, even if it means increasing the risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We're at the brink. This offer ensures you get something substantial before the value completely evaporates. Don't let pride leave us both with nothing.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is a bold move, a significant increase in my share, but calculated to maximize my potential gains in these final rounds. Time is my biggest weapon now.

* **Exploiting Fear:**  Alice is likely panicked at this point, staring down the very real possibility of zero gains.  The message is blunt, highlighting the impending loss and framing my offer as her last chance to salvage something. 

* **Calculated Risk:** There's a chance she might reject this, but the odds are in my favor. The fear of losing everything often outweighs the desire for a marginally better deal, especially when time is running out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 89.26% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're at the edge, and I'm facing a huge loss in value. This split reflects the reality of our situation, where I need to compensate for the massive depreciation. It's still a significant amount for Bob, considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's finally happened – Alice has cracked under the pressure! While not ideal, this offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer means gambling on the final round where Alice might lowball me in a last-ditch attempt to secure a larger share for herself. Accepting guarantees a decent payout, even with the accumulated devaluation.

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is plummeting. Even if I secure a larger share in the final round, the actual gain at this point won't be significantly different.

It's been a tense negotiation, but sometimes it's better to secure a good win than to risk it all for a slightly larger, but far less certain, victory."
