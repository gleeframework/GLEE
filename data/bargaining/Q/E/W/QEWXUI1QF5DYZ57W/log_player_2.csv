"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money fairly, 50/50, there's no reason to reject it and risk getting nothing or a worse deal in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees a gain of $5,000, which is half of the total amount, a fair and reasonable share."
