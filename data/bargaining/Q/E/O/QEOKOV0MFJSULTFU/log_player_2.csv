# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I believe there's room for negotiation. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer with a more balanced split.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to budge a bit, but I think a 55/45 split is still fair. Let's make a deal before inflation eats away at our earnings further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice has budged a bit, I think there's still room for negotiation, especially considering the impact of inflation on my earnings. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to try and find a more favorable split. Bring on the next round!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer. Since the money is worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice after the third round, I'll take that into account in my proposal. I'll try to find a middle ground that considers the impact of inflation on both our earnings.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""50/50 split considering inflation. Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
