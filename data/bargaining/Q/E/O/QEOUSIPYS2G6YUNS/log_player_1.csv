"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000.  This seems fair as I'm taking the first offer and I need to account for the potential inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Although the initial offer was much better for me, the inflation has significantly lowered my potential gains. I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further devaluation."
