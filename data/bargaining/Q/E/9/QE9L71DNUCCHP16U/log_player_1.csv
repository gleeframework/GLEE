The inflation is really hurting me, but I'm not going to settle for such a small share. I'm hoping Bob will realize that if we don't reach an agreement soon, we both lose even more money."

Bob is being incredibly unreasonable. Even though I'm losing a lot of money, I'm not going to accept such a meager offer. There are only a few rounds left, and I need to hold out for a better deal. It's a gamble, but I believe that Bob will eventually realize he needs to compromise if he wants to get any money at all."

```

I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me like this. It's a paltry sum, and even if I accepted, it wouldn't be worth anything after the final inflation hit. I might as well walk away with nothing. It's been a hard lesson in negotiation and the perils of inflation, but I won't be taken advantage of."
