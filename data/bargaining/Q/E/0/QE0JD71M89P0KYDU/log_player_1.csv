"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and Bob gets the remaining $300,000. My message to Bob is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping he'll take the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll have to accept a smaller amount due to the 5% inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation that's affecting my share. I'll wait for his next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair compromise given the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. My message to Bob is a bit taunting, but I'm hoping to get him to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, Alice! Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain! In Round 4, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, although I'd like to get more, the 45% I'd get in this offer is better than the 40% I'd get in the previous offer, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal due to further inflation."
