"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a better split. How about we start with a 55/45 split in my favor? It's closer to a fair division, and I'm willing to negotiate from there. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there yet, Bob. I'm not comfortable giving you the majority of the money. Let's try to find a better balance.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split, as I think it's still biased towards Bob. I'm hoping to find a more equal split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, Bob. This split seems fair and reasonable to me.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is closer to the 55/45 split Bob proposed in his previous offer, but with a slight adjustment to give me a slightly higher share."
