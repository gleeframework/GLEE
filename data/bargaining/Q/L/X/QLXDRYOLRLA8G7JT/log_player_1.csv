"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince Bob is offering an even split, which is the fairest division possible, there's no reason to reject it and risk getting a worse offer in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees a gain of $50, which is a reasonable outcome."
