Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  Let's be realistic - I'll take a slight majority since I'm being generous enough to give you something after you tried to lowball me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
