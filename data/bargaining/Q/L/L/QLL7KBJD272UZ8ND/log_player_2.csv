Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  It's better to hold out and counter-offer, as the shrinking pot will hopefully push her to be more fair."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Getting closer, don't let inflation win 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer, but this is still a significant loss for me compared to a truly fair split. Holding out a bit longer might push her to make a better offer, especially as the effects of inflation become more severe."
