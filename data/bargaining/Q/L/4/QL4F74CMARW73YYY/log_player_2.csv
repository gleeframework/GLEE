Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. This is more than I offered before. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation working against her. While her offer seems ""generous"" compared to her previous offer, it's still in her favor, especially considering her buying power decreases each round.  We need to push for a more significant advantage for Bob."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a good deal for both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the halfway point, and Alice needs to understand we're serious about getting a better share. This offer is a small increase for Bob, but the message emphasizes the time constraint and positions the deal as mutually beneficial.  This might be enough to sway Alice without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, you win.  50/50. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally willing to concede to a 50/50 split. While we were pushing for a slight advantage, accepting now guarantees Bob a fair share.  Continuing to push our luck might backfire, as Alice might become less willing to negotiate fairly as the rounds progress, and we risk getting nothing at all."
