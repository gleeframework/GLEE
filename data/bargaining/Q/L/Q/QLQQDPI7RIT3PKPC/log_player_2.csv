"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. We can move on from here.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. That first offer was ridiculous. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Take it or leave it, but remember, the pot gets smaller for you with every round."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's compromise. I'm willing to accept a 60/40 split in your favor. This is the best I can do, considering the shrinking value of the money. It's a better deal than rejecting and risking getting nothing in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
