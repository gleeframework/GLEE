"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling a bit more generous this round. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain.

Considering the offer, I'll reject it for now. The offer is still quite close to the initial split, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gain, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! The value of money is slipping away!""
}
```"
