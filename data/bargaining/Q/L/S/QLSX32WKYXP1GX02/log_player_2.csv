Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's finalize the deal! 
# Bob gain: 4060 
# Alice gain: 5940 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a better deal, with inflation, I'm better off accepting this offer than risking getting a worse deal in the next round."
