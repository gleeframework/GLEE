"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly reminder that this is a fair and generous offer, and it's in both of our best interests to accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a fair split.  Let's both get 60% of the pie this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is 10% less than the original $6,000, so I would get $5,400 (6,000 x 0.9). Bob's gain is 5% less than the original $4,000, so he would get $3,800 (4,000 x 0.95).

Considering the offer, I'd rather not accept it. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll counter with a better offer. Let's split the remaining 10,000 in a 55/45 ratio in my favor.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain is now 10% of 5,400, which is $540. So, the total amount I would gain in this round is $5,940.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5940,
  ""bob_gain"": 4060,
  ""message"": ""This is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's finalize the deal!""
}
```"
