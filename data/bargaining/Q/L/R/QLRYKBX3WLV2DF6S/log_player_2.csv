# Alice's message: I'll take the lead, trying to keep up with inflation 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is finally acknowledging the inflation, but she's still trying to take a larger share. I'll hold out for a better offer as time (and inflation) are on my side."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it down the middle, we're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  While I was hoping for a slightly larger share, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is willing to compromise."
