"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started, I'm willing to compromise. Accept this offer and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better offer. Let's see if you'll accept it. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gain.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money now. In Round 3, my potential gain is worth 40% less than in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more generous, but I still need a fair share. Consider this offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not getting any younger. Let's see if you'll accept it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now. My potential gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too low for my taste.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.
