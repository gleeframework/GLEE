Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the offer is slightly more favorable to me than the previous one, I'll accept it.
