"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split, let's see if you'll accept""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the upcoming inflation. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $48 instead of $60.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, considering I'd be getting less than I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 40% less than the original $100. I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm adjusting for inflation, but I'm still willing to compromise""
