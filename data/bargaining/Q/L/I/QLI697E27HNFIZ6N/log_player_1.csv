"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 80 for me, 20 for you. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being a bit too greedy, Alice! I'll give you a small share, but I'm taking the majority. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject this offer. The 10 I'd get is not enough, and I'm not willing to let Bob take 90% of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. 60 for me, 40 for you. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'll give you a tiny bit, but I'm taking most of the cake. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this one... But considering the decreasing value of the money I'd get, I'll reject this offer.
