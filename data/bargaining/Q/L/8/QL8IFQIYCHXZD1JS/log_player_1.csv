"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly. Since the value of the money decreases with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement soon. I've included a message suggesting a fair split to persuade Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. But we'll both still get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I'd be getting $400,000 that's worth 10% less than in the first round, and I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Plus, Bob's offer doesn't seem fair to me, as he's taking a significantly larger share. I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round or make a counteroffer that will be more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm making a new offer, trying to find a middle ground. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than in my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get more than Bob offered me in the previous round. I've included a message suggesting that we meet in the middle, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and reach an agreement."
