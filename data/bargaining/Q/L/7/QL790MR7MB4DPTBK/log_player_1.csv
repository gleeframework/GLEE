"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less now.

I'll carefully consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a slightly higher share to compensate. However, I don't want to be too greedy, as the game is still early.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
