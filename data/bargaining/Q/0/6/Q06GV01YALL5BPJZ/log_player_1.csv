"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it gives Bob a decent amount to work with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new values.

If I accept Bob's offer, I would get $50, which is 50/60 = 83.33% of the original $60 I was initially offered. Considering the 20% decrease in value, this is a good deal for me.

I accept the offer.
