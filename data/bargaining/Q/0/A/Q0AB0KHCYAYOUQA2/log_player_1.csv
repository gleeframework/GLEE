"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This ensures a good starting point, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to fight for a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep a larger share, the 5% inflation on my side makes accepting Bob's offer the best choice.  It's a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the inflation."
