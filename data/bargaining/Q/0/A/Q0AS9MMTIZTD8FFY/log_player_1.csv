Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut is still bigger to account for inflation, but let's be a bit more realistic. 
# Alice gain: 5500

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The deal needs to be better for me than before, since we are getting closer to the deadline and you're feeling the inflation more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This offer is getting worse for me with each round. While the deadline pressure is on, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than Bob is not in my best interest. I need to hold firm and hope Bob gets more reasonable."
