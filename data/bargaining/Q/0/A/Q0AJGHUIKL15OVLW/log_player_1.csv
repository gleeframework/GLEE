"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split, where I get 80 dollars and Bob gets 20 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's move closer to 50/50. If we keep rejecting offers, the money will be worth less for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less, and Bob is trying to negotiate a more even split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 15 dollars. I'll make a counteroffer: 60 for me and 40 for you.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less now. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer. Let's end this before the value drops further.""
}
```

I'm reiterating my previous counteroffer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game before the money loses more value."
