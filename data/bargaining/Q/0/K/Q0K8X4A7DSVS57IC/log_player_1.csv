I'm starting with a proposal that favors me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing,  I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a more equitable split this time, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer. I believe this is fair, given that we're both losing money due to the inflation. Let's see if he agrees."
