"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount and it's a fair starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55% and you get 45%. Let's be fair, but I'll need a little more to make it worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a larger share, but I can still get a decent amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
