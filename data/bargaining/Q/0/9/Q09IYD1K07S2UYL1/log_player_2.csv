"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While it seems fair on the surface, the steep inflation rate working against me means I need to push for a larger share in the early rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation heavily impacts me. This offer gives you a significant sum upfront.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still unacceptable. While she acknowledges the inflation, the proposed split doesn't reflect the significant difference in how it impacts us. I need to hold firm and push for a more favorable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging your need for a larger initial share while reflecting the impact of inflation on my end.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out! Inflation is hitting me hard, I need a fair share now. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting frustrating. While Alice acknowledges the time pressure and inflation, her offer is still not reflective of the rapidly decreasing value for both of us. Accepting now would leave me with a significantly smaller portion than I need. I have to hold firm and hope she makes a more realistic offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting critical. My offer is more than generous considering how much value we've already lost to inflation. Let's be reasonable and close this deal now.""} 
```"
