"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, but I can do better than that!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a chance to do better, but I'm not settling for 60/40!""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but don't think you're getting away with a huge advantage!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take this offer!"
