"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70% and you'll get 30%.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's make this quick and avoid any more inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 60/40 split is indeed a more generous offer from Bob's perspective.

However, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. Considering the value of the money decreases by 20% each round, I'd rather try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing by 20% each round, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60% now, but I'm willing to give you 40%. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
