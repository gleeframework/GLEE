"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10% and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

10% is too low, especially since I know the money is worth more to me than Alice in the next round. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. This is a good start for both of us, and I think we can both come out ahead in the long run.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%.  Let's split it 70/30, and we can both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 70/30 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I was aiming for. I'll try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 55/45. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with a substantial amount.""}
