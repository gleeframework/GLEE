400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by letting the money depreciate further.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money 65/35 in my favor. This still leaves a significant portion for you, and we can avoid further depreciation.",Alice,3,
