Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I'm aiming for a slightly better split for me this time.  Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out and the value is shrinking. I'm holding firm on a better split for me, but this is a reasonable offer. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, knowing his losses are greater. He's barely budged from his initial offer. I need to show strength and willingness to walk away.  The longer this drags out, the more desperate he'll become to make a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and get something before it's worthless! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob is finally willing to compromise to a 50/50 split.  Given the increasing inflation and the dwindling number of rounds, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable outcome.  Holding out further risks getting nothing at all."
