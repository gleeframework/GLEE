"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but I'm taking a bit more. This opening offer sets the stage for negotiations, considering the impact of inflation on Bob's valuation of the money as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his claim of generosity, the split he's proposing is still not in my favor, especially considering that the value of the money remains constant for me but decreases for him with each round. By rejecting, I aim to pressure Bob into a more favorable split as the rounds progress, leveraging the fact that further delays will continue to devalue his potential gains."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering your loss to inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer slightly, still favoring myself but acknowledging the pressure of inflation on Bob's valuation. By pointing out the impact of inflation, I aim to make my offer seem more reasonable and appealing, hoping that Bob will recognize the decreasing value of his potential gains over time and accept this division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite his plea for reasonableness and the acknowledged impact of inflation on his potential gains, the split he proposes still doesn't significantly favor me. Given that the value of the money remains constant for me, I see no urgency to accept an offer that doesn't prioritize my gains, especially since Bob's losses to inflation will continue to mount with each passing round. By holding out, I'm betting on Bob becoming more desperate to settle as the value of his potential share continues to decrease."

This is as fair as it gets""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've made a slight adjustment downwards from my previous offer, still ensuring I receive the larger share but acknowledging the increasing pressure on Bob due to inflation. My message is designed to remind Bob of the mounting losses he faces with each rejection, suggesting that my offer is the most reasonable he can expect under the circumstances. The aim is to persuade Bob that further negotiation will only result in a worse outcome for him, making this offer more appealing by comparison."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite his claim of making a compromise and the significant impact of inflation on his potential gains, the split he proposes is still not as favorable to me as I believe I can achieve. Given that Bob's share is now worth nearly 41% less than at the start, I anticipate that his eagerness to settle will continue to increase with each round, potentially leading to an even better offer for me. By rejecting, I'm applying further pressure, hoping to extract the most beneficial split possible as Bob's losses mount.

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?
### Assistant: {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer once again, despite his pleas for settlement. Given the significant devaluation of Bob's share due to inflation, I believe he is under increasing pressure to accept a less favorable split. Bob's admission of ""losing his shirt"" indicates his growing desperation, which I aim to leverage to my advantage.

My message is direct and forceful, emphasizing the dwindling time and value left for Bob, aiming to make him realize that further negotiation is futile.

# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?
### Assistant: {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in this round. Given the substantial impact of inflation on Bob's share, which is now worth 74.1% less than initially, I believe I've maximized the pressure on him to concede a favorable split. Bob's message, pleading for mercy, indicates a high level of desperation, suggesting he is unlikely to reject further offers that are even less in his favor. Accepting this offer secures a significant share of $6,000 for me, which remains undiminished by inflation, while Bob's share, although significantly reduced in value, still represents a tangible gain for him, albeit a much smaller one than he would have liked."
