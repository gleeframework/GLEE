"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll try to find a balance that benefits me more. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, Bob, but I'm not giving up half of the value I've lost from inflation. This is my final offer before we risk losing even more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Alice's offer again, considering that the money is worth 9.75% less for me and 36% less for Alice. Since Alice is trying to make up for the lost value due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice said this is her ""final offer,"" but I'm not convinced she won't come back to the negotiating table. I'll take the risk and proceed to the next round, trying to find a more favorable split. Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","In this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me and 36% less for Alice, I'll try to find a balance that benefits me more. Considering Alice's previous message, I'll try to make a more convincing offer. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I understand you're trying to make up for the lost value, but I'm also losing value each round. This is a more realistic split, given the circumstances.""}

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we've both lost significant value due to inflation. Let's stop this cycle and split the remaining value evenly. It's the only way to ensure we both get something at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant loss of value due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept Alice's offer to split the remaining value evenly. At this point, we've both lost a substantial amount, and further negotiations might lead to even greater losses. By accepting this offer, I'll secure a gain of 50, which, although worth 18.55% less than initially, is still a reasonable outcome given the circumstances. It's time to stop the cycle and ensure we both get something. I'll accept Alice's offer and conclude the game."
