"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  It gives you a good share, and I'm willing to take a smaller piece.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let's split it 65/35.  I'll take the larger share, but it's still more fair than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the deal.  While it's not ideal, I don't want to risk the inflation eating away at my share any further."
