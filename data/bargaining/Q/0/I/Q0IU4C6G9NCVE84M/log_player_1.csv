"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the difference""
}
```

This is a relatively fair offer, with me getting 60% of the total amount and Bob getting 40%. The message is a friendly reminder that we can always negotiate further if Bob wants to."
