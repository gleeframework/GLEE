"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

This is a fairly standard starting offer, with me taking the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 70 is actually worth 63 (70 * 0.9) and Bob's gain of 30 is worth 24 (30 * 0.8).

I'll accept this offer.
