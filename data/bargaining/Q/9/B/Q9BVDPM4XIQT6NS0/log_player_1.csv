"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  Since this is the first round, I want to secure a large share, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more,  accepting this offer means I still get a decent amount, and I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round due to inflation."
