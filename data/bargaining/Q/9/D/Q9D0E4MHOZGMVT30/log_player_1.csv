"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In the first round, I was offered $2,000, which is now worth 80% of its original value due to inflation.

Considering Bob's offer, I get $4,000, which is worth 80% of $5,000, and Bob gets $6,000, which is the same as in the first round.

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the inflation effect.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80%), I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the cumulative inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% of its original value due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking. In the first round, I was offered $2,000, which is now worth 51.2% of its original value.

Considering Bob's offer, I get $3,000, which is worth 60% of $5,000, and Bob gets $7,000, which is the same as in the first round.

I'll accept this offer because it's a better deal than I would get in the next round, considering the inflation effect.
