Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since the money is worth less to Bob in each round, I believe this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still confident that I can get a better deal than Bob's offer.  I'm proposing an 80/20 split, acknowledging that Bob's money is worth less now. I'm hoping this will be fair enough for him to accept."
