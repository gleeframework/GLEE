"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's end the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30$ and keeping 70$ for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can both walk away with some cash!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money fairly. It's the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable proposal. However, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money is decreasing, so I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate still in effect, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a larger share of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40$ and keeping 60$ for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need to secure a good portion for myself too. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than his previous offer, but still not ideal.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'd like to try to get an even better deal. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a larger share of the money.

  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal, Bob! Don't let the inflation get the best of us!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45$ and keeping 55$ for myself. Let's see if he'll take it!"
