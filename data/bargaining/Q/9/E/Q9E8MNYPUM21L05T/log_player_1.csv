"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small portion.  This is to hopefully establish a good foundation for negotiation and avoid a scenario where we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than my initial proposal. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 80% to show I'm willing to negotiate.  Since Bob's offer was so lopsided, I'm hoping this will encourage him to consider a more equitable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair.  I'll reject it and keep trying to get a better split. The inflation is impacting him more severely, so he might be willing to compromise more in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to find a middle ground.  The inflation is making it harder for us to reach an agreement, so I need to be flexible."
