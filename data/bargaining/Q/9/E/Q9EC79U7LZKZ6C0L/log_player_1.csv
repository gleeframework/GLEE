"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This ensures we both get a fair share, with you receiving slightly less.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split in my favor.  This accounts for the inflation you mentioned, and allows for a fairer outcome for me.  Let's finish this! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
