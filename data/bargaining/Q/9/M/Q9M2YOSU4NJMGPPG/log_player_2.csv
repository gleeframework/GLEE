"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your offer was unfair to me. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. Let's be reasonable and wrap this up.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** I need to act quickly because the value of the money decreases for me with each round.
* **Fairness:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. My offer is a counter-proposal that is still slightly in my favor but encourages a quicker agreement.
* **Urgency:** The message aims to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to settle rather than risk her share decreasing in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 55/45 split is my final offer.  Let's end this before inflation eats away any more of our money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me.  Rejecting this offer means I risk getting even less in the next round.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, accepting this offer still gives me a significant portion of the money. Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of losing a significant amount due to inflation.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer. It's unlikely she'll budge further, and pushing her might lead to a worse outcome for me."
