"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll get a chance to make your own offer in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $1000, it's better to reject this offer.  The inflation rate significantly affects Alice more than it does me. There's a good chance I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
