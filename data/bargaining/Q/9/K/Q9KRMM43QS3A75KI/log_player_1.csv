"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, you can have nothing.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20, you can have the rest. Let's start with something fair. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 20 is still worth 20, but Bob's gain of 80 is worth 72 (80 * 0.9).

I'm not sure I'm ready to settle for just 20, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value after two rounds, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but don't expect me to go easy on you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, a fair split, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's gain of 60 is worth 73.09 (60 / 0.8229) and my gain of 40 is still worth 40.

I'm not sure I'm ready to accept a 40-60 split, especially since I was hoping to get a larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.8229 = 0.70861 of its original value after four rounds, I'll aim to get an even larger share this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting impatient, take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no more games 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's gain of 50 is worth 29.55 (50 / 0.6935) and my gain of 50 is still worth 50.

Splitting it down the middle seems like a decent compromise, especially since the money is worth less and less with each passing round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
