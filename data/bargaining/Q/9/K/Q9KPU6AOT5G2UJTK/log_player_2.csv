Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer before inflation eats up all the potential gains for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

This is a tough one, but it's better to take a less-than-ideal deal than risk getting nothing. Here's why:

* **Inflation is hurting Alice more:**  While I'm not affected by inflation, Alice is getting a significantly worse deal with each round. This makes her more likely to accept a lower offer as time goes on.
* **Time pressure:**  We're over halfway through the rounds. Waiting too long could lead to both of us walking away with nothing. 
* **A bird in the hand:** $40 is not my ideal outcome, but it's better than the increasing risk of getting $0."
