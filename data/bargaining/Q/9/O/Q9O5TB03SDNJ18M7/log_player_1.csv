Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not going to be generous like you were. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's try 60/40 this time.  It's more fair than your last offer, and I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up more than that. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share, it's still better than getting nothing in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees a gain for me, while rejecting it risks losing everything."
