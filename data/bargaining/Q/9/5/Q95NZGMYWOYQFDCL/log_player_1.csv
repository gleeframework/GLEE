"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a more balanced split is necessary. Let's try 60/40 this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to mirror my previous offer. I'll consider his proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth 80% of its original value. I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you agree.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 52% of the adjusted $800,000, and taking 48%."
