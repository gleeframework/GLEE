"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. My last offer was generous, this one is fair. Time is running out for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems tempting, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing for me (Bob) with each round.  Holding out for a better deal is still the best strategy, even if it means risking getting nothing. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a larger share."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this offer is a compromise. It acknowledges the time pressure while still providing a reasonable split. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses from inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I lowered my demand from 600,000 to 550,000 to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We are both feeling the pressure of the decreasing value of the money. This offer should motivate Alice to settle.
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:**  Constantly rejecting offers without moving towards a middle ground could lead to both of us losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. This offer considers the time constraint and gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. Her offer is getting worse, not better! While the time constraint is a factor, accepting an offer this low sets a dangerous precedent. I need to hold my ground and show Alice I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm compromising again.  This offer reflects the time pressure but is more in line with a fair split. Don't let this opportunity slip away.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a Strong Stance:** While I'm adjusting my offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly advantageous split, even considering the inflation.
* **Conveying Urgency:** My message emphasizes the dwindling time and the potential loss for both of us if we don't agree soon.
* **Incremental Concessions:** By reducing my demand in smaller increments, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate but also firmness in seeking a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a very reasonable share considering the time pressure.  Let's be sensible and end this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While Alice's offer is far from ideal, it's the best offer I'm likely to get at this stage. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. Each round of rejection makes the situation considerably worse for me.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has consistently rejected my offers, indicating she's unlikely to agree to a significantly better split, especially now that she senses my increasing desperation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer carries the massive risk of walking away with nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable sum, even with the impact of inflation.

It's painful to accept less than I believe is fair, but in this scenario, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
