Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm still taking a bigger hit. Let's meet in the middle. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I need a better deal than 40/60. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
