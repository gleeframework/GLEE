I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share or if he's going to try to negotiate.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth 20% less, it's still a good deal for me.  I'm getting half the money, and if I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get anything in the next round.  Let's take the money and run!"
