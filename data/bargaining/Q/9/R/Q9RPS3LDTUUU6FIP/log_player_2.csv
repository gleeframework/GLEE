Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather take a risk than accept an unfair deal 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly banking on Bob getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into his potential gains.  While her offer is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Bob needs to hold firm and demonstrate he's willing to risk it all to get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6200,
""alice_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Alice. Accept this offer, or we both lose big.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob needs to increase the pressure on Alice. By offering a slightly better deal than before, he shows some willingness to compromise but still emphasizes the urgency of the situation.  The message is direct and forceful, highlighting the potential losses for both if she continues to play hardball."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not backing down, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Alice is stubbornly clinging to a slight advantage.  Let's analyze:

* **Time Pressure:** Only 5 rounds left. The situation is getting dire for both of us.
* **Alice's Offer:** While still in her favor, this is the closest she's come to a 50/50 split.  It's clear the shrinking pot is making her nervous.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting carries the risk of getting even less later, or even nothing. 

Considering the advanced stage of the game and the rapidly diminishing returns, I'll swallow my pride. 

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:** It's better to secure a reasonable, though not ideal, amount now than risk walking away with nothing. This decision prioritizes minimizing potential loss at this late stage."
