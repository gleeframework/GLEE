"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want to try to get a bit more. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer. I think 50-50 is a bit too even, considering the initial proposal I made was 80-20. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer is now worth less, so I'll try to adjust accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, but still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more to account for the inflation, but I still want a slight edge. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my offer!

Considering the significant drop in value, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer. I think 45-55 is still a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor, especially given the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting now! My offer is worth a lot less than initially. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need to get a bit more to make it worth my while. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more, but I'm being more aggressive in my proposal to try to get a better deal."
