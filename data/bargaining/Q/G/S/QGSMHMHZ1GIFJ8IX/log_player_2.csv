"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair at the moment, I know the money will be worth less to me in future rounds. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice 400,000 and keep 600,000 for myself. This is a simple reversal of her offer, and since the money will be worth less to me in the next round, I think it's a fair counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial offer, the money is now worth significantly less to me due to inflation. I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a better deal, as I'm confident I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice 300,000 and keep 700,000 for myself. This is a more aggressive offer than my previous one, but I believe it is still fair considering the inflation that has occurred."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. While the money is worth significantly less to me now due to inflation, I am still getting a fair share of the money.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is too high, as I could end up with nothing if we run out of rounds. It's time to secure what I can."
