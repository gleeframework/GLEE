"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to keep 9000$ for myself and give Bob 1000$.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it ensures I get the majority of the money while still giving Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, this is a fair split and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the next round.  Accepting ensures I get at least $5,000, whereas rejecting could leave me with nothing if Bob offers to keep all the money next round."
