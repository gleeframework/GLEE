"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and simple starting point."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the relative difference in our gains.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round.
