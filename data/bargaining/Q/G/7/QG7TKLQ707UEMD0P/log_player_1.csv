"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, but still trying to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and this seems like a relatively fair split considering the current economic conditions."
