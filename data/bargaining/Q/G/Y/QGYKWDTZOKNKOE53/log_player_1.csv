I'm going for a large share, but I'm leaving Bob with a decent amount to hopefully encourage acceptance in this first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even with the 20% inflation. I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my demand a bit to show flexibility, but still aiming for a majority share.  Let's see if Bob is more willing to compromise this time."
