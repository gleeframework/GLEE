{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob the entire $10,000. I think this is an unfair and bullying tactic, and I'm not going to let Bob get away with it. I'll reject this offer and stick to my guns.

I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me and get everything. I'm going to stand firm and hope that Bob will come back to the negotiating table with a more reasonable offer.

Since I've rejected Bob's offer, I think we're at a stalemate."

Since we're at a stalemate, I'm going to propose a final offer that's a compromise. Since we've both been making offers, I think we should split the money 50/50.

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money 50/50. We've both made offers, and it's only fair to split it evenly.""}
