"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor,  since I'm taking the risk of proposing first.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the offer, I'm not sure it's fair that Alice gets 60% just for proposing first.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
