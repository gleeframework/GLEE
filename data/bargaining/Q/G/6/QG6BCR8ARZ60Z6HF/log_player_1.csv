"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, you can try to do better""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. The message is a challenge to Bob to try and do better."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, my value for the money has decreased.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this is a good enough offer, considering the value of the money has decreased. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, my value for the money has decreased further.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try a 3:2 split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:2 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. The message is an attempt to find a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less due to inflation, my value for the money has decreased significantly.

Considering Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think a 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and it's better than going into further rounds where the money will be worth even less."
