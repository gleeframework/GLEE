Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to be fair, and I appreciate that. However, I think this split is more reflective of the game's dynamics. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
