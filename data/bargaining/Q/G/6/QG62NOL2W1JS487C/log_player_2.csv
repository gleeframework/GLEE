"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm willing to take a little less, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial division. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. Let's split the difference, and we both get a decent share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation, but I'm not comfortable with an unequal split. Let's go for a 50/50 split this time, and we can both get something reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, a 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point. It's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
