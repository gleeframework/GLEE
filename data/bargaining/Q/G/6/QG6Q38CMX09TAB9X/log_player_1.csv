Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing value with each round. I'm willing to meet you halfway this time, but if we continue, the situation will only worsen for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for you with each round. Waiting any longer means getting even less of the original $10,000.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is in a strong position as he's not affected by the inflation. He knows you're under pressure to accept a deal quickly. 
* **Future Rounds:** If you reject this offer, Bob is likely to propose even less favorable terms in the next round, pushing you closer to accepting a much smaller amount. 

Accepting the 45/55 split in Round 4 cuts your losses and avoids the risk of an even worse outcome."
