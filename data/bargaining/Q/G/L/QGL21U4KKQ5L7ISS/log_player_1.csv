"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split is the most equitable way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best option for me, considering the decreasing value of the money. However, I don't want to reject the offer without a good reason. Let me think for a moment...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm hoping this is a more reasonable offer, considering the decreasing value of the money."
