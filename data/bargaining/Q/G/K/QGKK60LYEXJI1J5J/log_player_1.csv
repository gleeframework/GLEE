"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $5,000, and we can go from there.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm not committing to anything more generous just yet!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this round, but still leave some for you. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my decisions now that the money is worth less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than $2,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less again, I'll have to be more aggressive with my proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share this round, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to maximize my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share this round, but I'm not giving away too much! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to add up! I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $4,000 is a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less purchasing power."
