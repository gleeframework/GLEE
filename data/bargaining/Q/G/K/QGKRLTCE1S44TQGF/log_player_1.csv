"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial 100$. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the initial split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'm not thrilled about the 40% offer, but it's a slightly better split than my initial offer. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations.
