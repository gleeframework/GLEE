I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, as I have the first mover advantage.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $10, I know that I have the advantage in the next round as I'll be making the offer. I'll see if I can get a better deal for myself!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy as round 1. I'll offer a slightly more even split, hoping to convince Bob that it's better to take this deal than risk another round where his money will be worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. The inflation is starting to impact him more heavily, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Alice slightly, but still keeping a significant majority for myself.  With each passing round, Bob's money is worth less, so I'm pushing for a deal that's more favorable to me."
