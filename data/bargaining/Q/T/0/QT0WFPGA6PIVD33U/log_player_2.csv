Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, my offer is more generous than before 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, time is running out. I'll meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the situation. While her offer is slightly better, it's not enough to offset the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gains. I need to push for a more equitable split in the next round or two before the value diminishes significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5400,
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer now, or the inflation will hurt us both. I'm offering you more than you'd get if we split evenly after the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know inflation is hurting your share, but I'm not budging much. This is my best offer so far 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and the impact of inflation is becoming severe. While this offer isn't ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get from Alice. Accepting now secures me something, whereas continuing to hold out risks getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
