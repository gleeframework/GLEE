"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair given the potential for money to lose value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
