"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leave $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it 50/50, no haggling! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $400,000. Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $475,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. The split is 50/50, but considering the inflation, I'd be getting $400,000 and Bob would get $475,000. It's a relatively close split, but I think I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). I'll offer to take a smaller share to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 384000,
  ""bob_gain"": 616000,
  ""message"": ""Be reasonable, Bob. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. Take it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 38.4% of its original value, which is $115,200. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 84.74% of its original value, which is $847,800.

This offer is a bit too one-sided, considering the inflation. I'd rather not accept it.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 40.96% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512). I'll try to make a more reasonable offer.

  ""bob_gain"": 744000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal, Bob. Don't be greedy!""

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, Alice. Take it or lose everything! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $150,000 is now worth 15% of its original value, which is $15,000. Bob's gain of $850,000 is worth 85% of its original value, which is $850,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I think I have no choice. I'll take the $15,000 and call it a day.
