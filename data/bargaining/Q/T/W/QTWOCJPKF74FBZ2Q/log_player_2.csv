"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer is tempting, it's better to see if I can negotiate a better deal given the inflation works against Alice more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation rate we are dealing with.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer. It's a better deal for you than waiting another round. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is working against me significantly. Taking this offer ensures I get something, and it's more than I would likely get in the next round."
