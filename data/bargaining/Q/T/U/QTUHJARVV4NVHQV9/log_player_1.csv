```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I think this is a fair starting point. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll receive 4000 * 0.9 = 3600.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I'll receive 3600 * 0.9 = 3240.
