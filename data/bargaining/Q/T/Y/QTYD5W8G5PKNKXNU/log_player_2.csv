"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is generous, it's important to consider the potential for higher gains in future rounds.  Rejecting allows me to see what Alice's next offer might be, and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I believe this split is more fair. It allows us both to get a significant amount of money, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. This split is a bit more balanced, and I think it's a good step towards finding an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This offer is significantly better than the previous round's rejection. The inflation is starting to become a serious factor, and a 4000$ gain is decent considering the potential for further losses if we continue rejecting. It's a reasonable middle ground, and accepting secures a decent amount for me."
