**Reasoning:** While the offer is slightly better than before, time is working against me.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share or Alice will coast to a win with minimal concessions."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your desperation is showing 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Alice is clearly playing hardball and knows time is on her side.  Let's analyze:

* **The Offer:** 41 dollars is terrible considering the initial offer was 40. Inflation has eaten away a lot of value.
* **Rounds Remaining:** 5 rounds left means things will get much worse for me if I keep rejecting.
* **Alice's Demeanor:**  She's mocking my position, indicating she believes she has the upper hand.

**Decision:** I have to accept.  

**Reasoning:** While awful, it's very likely the best offer I'll get at this point. If I reject, Alice will likely offer even less next round, and the inflation will make the situation dire.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better than walking away with nothing.
