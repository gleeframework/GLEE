Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, but I still think I can get a better deal. Inflation is on my side. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are really hurting Bob's potential gains. While accepting this offer means getting a significantly smaller share, rejecting it means risking an even worse deal in the next round. Alice knows this and is clearly using it to her advantage. 

It's better for Bob to cut his losses and take the current offer than to risk getting a smaller amount in the next round."
