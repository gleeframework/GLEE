55.0,45.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. I think it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,I think your initial offer was too generous. I'll try to be more realistic this time.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 45/55 split is a more fair reflection of the current value of the money. It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
20.0,80.0,I'm starting to think you're not serious about finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll try to be more aggressive this time.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
35.0,65.0,"I'm still open to negotiation, but I won't be taken advantage of.  A 35/65 split is a compromise, but it reflects the decreasing value of the money. Let's work together to get something before it's too late.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
10.0,90.0,I'm not going to back down. You're not getting the better end of the deal if I can help it.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
25.0,75.0,"We're running out of time.  I'm proposing a 25/75 split, which is a significant compromise on my part.  If we don't agree, we both lose out completely. Let's find a solution before it's too late.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
5.0,95.0,I'm not budging. You're getting a raw deal if you think you can get 75% of the money. I'm taking what's mine.,Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
15.0,85.0,"We're close to the end.  I'm willing to take a big loss at this point, but a 15/85 split is the most I can offer. It's still a better outcome than getting nothing at all.  Let's make a decision before the remaining value disappears completely.",Alice,9,
