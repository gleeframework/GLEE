"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end the game early""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous share, considering the inflation will reduce the value of the money over time. I'll keep $700,000, which is a significant amount that will still be worth a lot after the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much yet 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, Bob's offer is actually a bit more generous than it seems. If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 95% of $700,000 (the original value of what I could have gotten in Round 1). Bob will get $600,000, which is worth 80% of $750,000 (the original value of what he could have gotten in Round 1).

Considering the inflation, this offer is actually quite reasonable. I'll accept Bob's offer.
