"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Here's my proposal:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
