Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing, I need to hold out for a better offer from Alice. Accepting 40% now sets a low bar and she knows I'm getting desperate as the rounds progress.  The inflation hurts me more, but she also loses if we don't make a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, I'm meeting you halfway.  This is the best you'll get, let's end this.""} 

**Reasoning:**

I need to start showing some flexibility to get Alice to bite. This offer is still advantageous to me considering the faster inflation working against me. By framing it as a compromise and my final offer, I'm hoping Alice sees it as a chance to secure a reasonable deal before the money shrinks even further."
