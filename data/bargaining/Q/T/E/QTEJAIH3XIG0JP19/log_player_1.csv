"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still keeping a decent chunk for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less after the first round, my gain of 6000 is now worth 95% of the initial 6000, which is 5700.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'm getting a smaller share than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully. However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
