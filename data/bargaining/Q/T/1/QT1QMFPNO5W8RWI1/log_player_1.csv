"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and I'm leaving room for Bob to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
