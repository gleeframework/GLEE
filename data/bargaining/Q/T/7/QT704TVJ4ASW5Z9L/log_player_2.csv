# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a good starting point, but I'm not content with such a lopsided split. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need more than half to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Alice is still taking a large portion, and while the offer is better than the first round, I'm still not convinced. I'll try to negotiate for a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
