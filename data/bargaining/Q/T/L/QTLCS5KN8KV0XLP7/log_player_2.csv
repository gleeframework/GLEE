# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and considering the inflation, I believe I can get a more favorable deal in the next rounds."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a more reasonable split.""}"

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer reflects the impact of inflation on both our ends. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems closer to a fair split considering the inflation, I'll wait for another round to see if I can leverage the increasing impact of inflation on my end to negotiate a slightly better deal. The difference in how inflation affects us might give me an edge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the accelerating impact of inflation on my end, I believe this split is more reflective of our current situation. It's a good time to settle.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It's crucial we settle now before inflation erodes the value any further.  Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my end, which has reduced the value of the money by 34.39%, and Alice's message indicating this is her final offer, I believe accepting this deal is the most reasonable decision at this point. The difference in the impact of inflation between us has put me at a disadvantage, and prolonging the game could lead to further loss of value. Accepting now secures a tangible amount, even if it's not the initial goal."
