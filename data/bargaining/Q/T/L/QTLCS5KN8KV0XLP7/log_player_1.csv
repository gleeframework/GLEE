Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I believe this is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation, it heavily favors him.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking further inflation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This offer reflects the impact of inflation on both our ends. Let's close the deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Inflation Impact:**  I need to factor in the increasing impact of inflation. Waiting longer will further diminish the value of the money.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It acknowledges the need for a more balanced split due to inflation.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a note of urgency might encourage Bob to accept rather than risk another round of devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the accelerating impact of inflation on my end, I believe this split is more reflective of our current situation. It's a good time to settle. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using the inflation as a negotiation tactic, trying to pressure me into accepting a less favorable deal.  While the inflation is significant for both of us, it's crucial not to let Bob dictate the terms solely based on his higher rate of devaluation. I need to hold my ground to secure a fair share, even if it means risking one more round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. It's crucial we settle now before inflation erodes the value any further.  Let's be reasonable and end this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  This offer is a slight concession from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility while still securing a reasonable share. 
* **Finality:** By stating it's my final offer, I'm emphasizing the urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Appealing to Reason:** Reminding Bob that further delay is detrimental to both of us emphasizes the need for a swift and amicable resolution."
