I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering I'm bearing the greater risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering an 80/20 split in my favor.  I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I still need to account for the inflation affecting my share more significantly."
