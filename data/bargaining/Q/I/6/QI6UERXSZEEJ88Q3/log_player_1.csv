"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
 
 I propose a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rate will affect Bob more significantly in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial proposal, even with the inflation considered. I will reject and make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}
```

I propose a split of 5400 for me and 4600 for Bob.  This offer is better for me than Bob's offer, and accounts for the inflation that has occurred."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has impacted the value of the money significantly, Bob's offer is the best I've received so far. It's worth accepting to avoid risking further losses from potential future rejections."
