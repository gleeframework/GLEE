"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can call it a day.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount and the game ends quickly."

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80
