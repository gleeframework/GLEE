"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair split and then see if we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that I'm the one proposing now.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual value of the money.

Since the offer is a 60-40 split, and I'm getting 40 dollars, I'll get 40 * 0.9 (due to the 10% inflation) = 36 dollars.

I'll reject the offer because I was hoping to get a better deal, considering the initial proposal I made was a 60-40 split, and now I'm getting a smaller share. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, and I want to get a better deal, I'll propose a smaller share for Bob.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even split than my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to negotiate further."
