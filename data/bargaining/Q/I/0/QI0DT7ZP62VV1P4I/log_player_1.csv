"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A small advantage for me, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $400,000 I would gain is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd rather not give him the majority of the money. I'll reject this offer.
