Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, Alice. How about I take 55 and you take 45? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder than me, Alice. I'll take 58, you get 42. It's getting less valuable for you by the minute! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While the value is decreasing, Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. Holding out for a slightly better offer in the next round is still worthwhile. The decreasing value makes every round crucial, but it doesn't make Bob's increasingly lopsided offers acceptable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we're both losing out because of the inflation. Let's split it evenly 50/50 and call it a day. This is the fairest outcome for both of us at this point.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Time Sensitivity:**  Each round significantly diminishes the value of the money. 
* **Fairness:**  While Bob has been trying to capitalize on the inflation, a 50/50 split reflects the increasingly compromised position both players are in.
* **Urgency:** Offering a 50/50 split emphasizes the need for a swift resolution before the value diminishes even further. 

It's crucial to make Bob see that dragging this out only hurts both players.  A firm but fair offer like this might be the push needed to reach an agreement."
