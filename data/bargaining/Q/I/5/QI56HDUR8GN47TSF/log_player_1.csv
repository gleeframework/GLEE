Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's also fair enough that Bob might accept it.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation is starting to hurt.  Bob's offer is still decent, and I don't want to risk him getting a better deal in the next round."
