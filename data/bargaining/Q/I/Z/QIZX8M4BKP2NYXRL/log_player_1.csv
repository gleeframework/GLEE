Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly.  Since the money will be worth less in future rounds, I think a 60/40 split is fair. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
