I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, as I want to see how Bob reacts.  Let's see if he's willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me, or if he's feeling greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like to get more, this is a fair offer and it avoids the risk of getting nothing. I'm not sure how much longer Bob will be willing to split the money evenly, especially with the inflation factor. It's better to take the 50% now while I still can."
