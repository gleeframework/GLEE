"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation will hit you harder. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. Given the significant difference in inflation impact between us, I believe I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 350000, ""alice_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I believe this split is more reasonable. It's in both our interests to conclude this soon.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I can't accept anything lower than this.  The inflation is starting to hurt, so let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, Alice's offer now seems more reasonable. Further negotiations may lead to diminishing returns due to the increasing devaluation of the money for me. It's prudent to accept this offer and conclude the game."
