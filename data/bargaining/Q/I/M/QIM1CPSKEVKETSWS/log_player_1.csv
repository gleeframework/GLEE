"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share of the pie.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $100, leaving Bob with 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for him than in the previous rounds. However, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I did in the previous round.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer again and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will finally accept a fair deal."
