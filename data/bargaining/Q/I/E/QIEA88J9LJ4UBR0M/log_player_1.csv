Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than an even split.  Let's see if you're open to a little negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4000/6000 split, but I'm willing to negotiate.

I'd like to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give a bit more to you, but I think 4500 is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 4500/5500 split, which is a slight concession from my initial 5000/5000 offer."
