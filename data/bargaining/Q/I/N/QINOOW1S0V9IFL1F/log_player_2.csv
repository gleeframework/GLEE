# Alice's message: I think a 50-50 split is the fairest option at this point.  We both get a decent amount, and it avoids any further negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, but Alice's share is affected by inflation, I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
