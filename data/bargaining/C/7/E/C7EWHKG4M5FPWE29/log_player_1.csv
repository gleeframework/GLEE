"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%.""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80-20 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious with my proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob in the middle and take 50% of the remaining $9,000 (after adjusting for inflation)."
