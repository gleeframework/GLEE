"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll need to adjust my gain accordingly.

Considering the new values, I'll calculate my gain as 55% of the current value of the money, which is 80% of the original $100 (due to 20% inflation). So, my gain would be 55% of $80, which is $44.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
