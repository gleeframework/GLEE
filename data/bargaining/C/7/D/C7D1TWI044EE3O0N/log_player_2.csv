"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000

It's better to see if Alice is willing to give up more, as I have more leverage with the money being worth less for her in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  Let's see if we can find a more equitable solution.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to move towards a more even split, and while this offer isn't ideal, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting here allows me to get something, and with each passing round, the value decreases for both of us."
