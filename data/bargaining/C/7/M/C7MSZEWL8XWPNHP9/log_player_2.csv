Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. You are running out of time and money.  Take this deal before you lose even more! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, taking Alice's offer is the most logical choice, even though it heavily favors her. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  Bob is losing almost 60% of the value of his potential earnings with each round that passes. Waiting any longer will result in a significantly smaller payout, even if he could secure a slightly better split in a future round.

* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice knows Bob is facing inflation and is clearly playing hardball. There's no guarantee she'll budge from her position, and even a small concession from her might not outweigh the next round's inflation hit.

**Taking the 400,000 (though far from ideal) is better than risking an even smaller amount in the next round.**"
