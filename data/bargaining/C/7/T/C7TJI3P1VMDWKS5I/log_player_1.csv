"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation hits you harder. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. My offer is generous considering the inflation. Let's close the deal now.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I think this is a more reasonable split now. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is using the inflation to his advantage, but his offer is still getting worse for me. I need to hold out for a better deal, as accepting now would be significantly worse than my round 3 offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is hurting both of us now. This offer is a compromise to get us both something before it's too late.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm lowering my demand slightly but still aiming for a greater share than Bob's offer. The message emphasizes the urgency due to inflation, hoping to push Bob towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value faster than me, it's time to be realistic about the split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now back to proposing a 60/40 split, taking advantage of the inflated losses on my side. It's getting risky, but I need to hold firm. I believe Bob is overestimating his position and will be forced to concede more in the coming rounds as the deadline approaches."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it.  I'm taking a hit here, but this ensures we both get something substantial before inflation eats it all away. Let's be smart and end this."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's getting down to the wire, and I need to make a move that demonstrates both flexibility and seriousness. Offering Bob slightly more than half acknowledges the inflation disadvantage, but my offer is still better for him than risking it all. The message stresses the urgency and the potential for mutual loss if we don't agree now."
