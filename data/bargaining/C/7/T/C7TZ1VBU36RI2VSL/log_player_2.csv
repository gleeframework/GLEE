Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money! Let's split the difference from my previous offer and move on. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the pot is shrinking fast. This offer is a good compromise - let's wrap this up.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the inflation is significantly eating into the potential gains, and it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  While not ideal, a 50/50 split is better than risking a total loss if we run out of rounds.
