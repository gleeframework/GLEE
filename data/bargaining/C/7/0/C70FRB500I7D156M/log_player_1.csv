"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything.  Since I don't know how the inflation impacts Bob, I'm going to maximize my gains in the first round.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to be more strategic in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would love to keep more, it's better to accept a 50/50 split.  It's possible that Bob's offer is a response to my greed in the first round.  If I reject this, we go to another round, and his offer will be worth less because of inflation.  I'm not sure how inflation impacts him, but a 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
