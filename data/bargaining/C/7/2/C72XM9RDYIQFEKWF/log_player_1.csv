"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. It's a good starting point considering the inflation, and I hope Bob will be reasonable.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob's proposal is simply a reversal of my previous one, and while I'm willing to compromise, I don't think it's fair to accept such a drastic shift in the distribution. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm willing to reduce my share to 800,000 dollars, but I'm also increasing Bob's share to 200,000 dollars. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement before the inflation gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is simply a mirror image of my previous one, but with even less money for me. I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll propose a more balanced division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to compromise, but I'm also taking inflation into account. I believe this is a fair offer that gives Bob a significant share while ensuring I get a reasonable amount after inflation. I hope we can come to an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still very lopsided in Bob's favor, and the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money. I'm not willing to accept a deal where I get such a small share. I will make a counter-offer in the next round, but I'm concerned that we are running out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is my final attempt at a fair compromise. I'm offering 600,000 dollars to myself, leaving 400,000 dollars for Bob.  I believe this is a reasonable split given the significant inflation we've experienced. If we don't reach an agreement this round, we both risk losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I appreciate Bob's continued willingness to negotiate, this offer is still too unfavorable for me, given the significant inflation.  I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I will propose a more balanced division in the next round, but we are running out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Given the significant inflation and the fact that we are running out of time, I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair compromise, considering the current state of the money. Let's hope Bob accepts this offer."
