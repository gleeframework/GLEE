"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but I'm still willing to share a portion with Bob. I believe this is a fair starting point, given the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is a significant improvement from the first round, it's still not an equitable division considering the inflation factor. I'll try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm reducing my proposed gain by another 2000, but I still need a sizable share to account for the inflation. I believe this offer is fair given the circumstances."
