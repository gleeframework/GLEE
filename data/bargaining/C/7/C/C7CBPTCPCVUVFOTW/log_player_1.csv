"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $200,000. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $550,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $450,000 is worth 95% of its original value.

I'll accept this offer.
