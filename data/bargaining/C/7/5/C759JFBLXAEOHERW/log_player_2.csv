"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's strike a deal, Bob. I believe a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is more reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\n### I made a counteroffer to Alice, taking into account the inflation rate that affects both of us but hits Alice harder. I believe a 55/45 split is more favorable considering the devaluation of money as the rounds progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n### Considering the progressive devaluation of money due to inflation and Alice's assertive stance that this is her final offer, it seems prudent to accept the 45/55 split. Continuing to reject offers risks further devaluation without a guarantee of a better proposal in subsequent rounds. Accepting now secures a tangible amount, albeit less than initially desired, but potentially more valuable than what could be obtained in future rounds due to the increasing impact of inflation."
