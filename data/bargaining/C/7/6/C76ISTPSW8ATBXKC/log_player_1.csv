I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, but I'm keeping slightly more for myself as I don't know how Bob will react.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $40, I believe I can do better. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Even though my offer is worth less due to inflation,  Bob's offer is worth significantly less for him (20% less).  This suggests he may be feeling the pressure and be more willing to negotiate.
* **Power shift:** In the next round, I'll be making the offer. This gives me leverage.

I'll aim for a higher split in the next round, keeping in mind the inflation factor for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my offer to $60 for myself, but still leaving a significant amount for Bob. My reasoning:

* **Inflation Advantage:** Bob's money is worth less due to the inflation factor. He might be more willing to accept a smaller share to secure something. 
* **Power Dynamics:**  I'm in control this round, and I want to maximize my potential gain while still leaving room for negotiation. 

Let's see if this offer is enough to convince Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation Hit:** The inflation is significantly impacting Bob's share, making his offer more attractive to me. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try for more in the next round, there's no guarantee I'll get it. Accepting this offer secures me a decent amount, and the risk of further inflation is too high. 
* **Potential for future rounds:** Even though this round ends the game, it sets a precedent for future negotiations. I can use this experience to my advantage in future scenarios where inflation might be a factor."
