"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair and balanced split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000. I think this is a fair and balanced split, considering we're starting with a large sum of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical, I'm taking a slightly larger share but we'll both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I understand Bob's perspective.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to get closer to a 50-50 split""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is a slight adjustment from my initial offer to get closer to a 50-50 split. I think this is a more reasonable compromise."
