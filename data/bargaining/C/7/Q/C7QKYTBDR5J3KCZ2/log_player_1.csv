"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm proposing to take 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars.  I want to maximize my share early on, as the inflation will affect me more with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While the money I gain is worth less due to inflation, the offer is still too unfavorable for me. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 80 dollars for myself and 20 dollars for Bob. While inflation is a factor, I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the need to negotiate sooner rather than later to avoid losing out on a larger share as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While the money I gain is worth less due to inflation, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher share for myself, especially considering that inflation will significantly impact Bob's share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 70 dollars for myself and 30 dollars for Bob. Inflation is starting to take its toll, and I need to secure a decent share before the value of my gains drops too drastically. While Bob is likely to reject this offer again, I'm hoping that the decreasing value of his future gains will motivate him to negotiate sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  Although the inflation is taking a toll, I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob's offers are getting increasingly unfavorable, and I'm hoping that he will realize the need to reach a compromise soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 60 dollars for myself and 40 dollars for Bob. The inflation is becoming a significant factor now, and I need to secure a share before it further diminishes the value of my gains. While Bob might reject this offer again, I believe it's a more reasonable compromise, given the current circumstances."
