"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'm not as keen on taking 50% of the remaining money. I'd like to try to get a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm aiming to take a larger share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take a toll on my potential earnings. However, Bob's offer is more generous than mine was in Round 3, and it's still a decent split. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
