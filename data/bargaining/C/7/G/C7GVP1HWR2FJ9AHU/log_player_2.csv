"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for you, don't wait for more inflation 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
This is slightly better than my last offer after accounting for the inflation, and further rounds will only make it worse.
