"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 990,000:10,000 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering the risk of inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share,  accepting this offer is the best strategy.  With inflation, my share will continue to shrink with each round. It's better to take the 500,000 now and avoid further losses."
