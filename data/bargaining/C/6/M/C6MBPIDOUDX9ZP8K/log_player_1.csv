Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. My turn to propose a reasonable split that accounts for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you slower, but my previous offer was more than fair. This is my final offer.""

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** Bob's offer was designed to take advantage of the faster inflation affecting Alice. By slightly adjusting the previous offer in his favor, he's betting on Alice feeling pressured to accept a less favorable deal. 
* **Finality:** By stating this is her final offer, Alice introduces a sense of urgency. Bob needs to consider if rejecting this offer is worth the risk of a potentially worse deal in further rounds, especially with the continuous inflation.
* **Balance:** This offer still gives Bob a significant portion, making it more appealing than a heavily one-sided offer. It strikes a balance between being firm and leaving room for a potential agreement."
