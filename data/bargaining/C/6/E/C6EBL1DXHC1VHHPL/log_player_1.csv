"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take 60%. What do you say?""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still leave you with a decent amount. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in Round 1 was a good one, but Bob wants more, huh?

Considering the inflation, my gain of 3000 is actually worth 2700 (since it's 10% less than 3000).

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my advantage. What's your next move?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Take or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 2920 (since it's 27.1% less than 4000).

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob in the middle, but I'll think about it...
