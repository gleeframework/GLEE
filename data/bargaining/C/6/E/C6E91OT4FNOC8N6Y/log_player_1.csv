"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering the money is worth less with each round.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining amount. The money is worth less with each round, but I'd like to keep a bit more for myself. It's my turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more now. Your turn again!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining amount, which is a bit more than Bob's previous offer."
