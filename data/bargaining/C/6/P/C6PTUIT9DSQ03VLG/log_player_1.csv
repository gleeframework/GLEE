"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is to convey a sense of fairness in the division, hoping that Bob will see the offer as reasonable and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a slightly better deal for me this time. Considering the inflation, it's still a good offer for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. The decrease in value due to inflation affects me more significantly than Bob, so I want to push for a division that reflects a better compensation for this disparity. By rejecting this offer, I get to make the next proposal, allowing me to suggest a division that I find more favorable under the current circumstances."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $580,000 and Bob receives $420,000. Given that the money is worth less due to inflation, especially more so for me, I've adjusted the amounts to still aim for what I perceive as a fair split, taking into account the devaluation of the money for both of us but emphasizing the greater impact on my share. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust fairly"" aims to convey that I've taken the changing value of the money into account and am willing to find a middle ground that reflects this economic reality."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and the money is losing value fast. I'm offering a reasonable deal - let's close this. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI choose to accept Bob's offer because, at this point, the money's value is decreasing significantly with each round, especially for me. Given that the offer is not drastically different from previous ones and considering the rapid devaluation, I believe it's prudent to accept this deal rather than risking further loss of value in subsequent rounds. The difference in the offers is not substantial enough to justify the risk of losing even more value due to inflation."
