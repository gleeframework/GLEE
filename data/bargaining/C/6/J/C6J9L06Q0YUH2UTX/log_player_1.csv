"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer, I'll have to accept a smaller share due to the 5% inflation. However, I'm not willing to accept the 60/40 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my share is now worth 5% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share to account for the inflation. Your turn again!""
}
