"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll give you a bit less, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is good enough. I was willing to give him 50% in the first round, and now he's only offering 40%. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think I can do better than this."

Round 3

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting a bit worried about the inflation, but I still think I can do better than this. 30% of the original amount is not enough for me, especially considering I was willing to give Bob a larger share earlier. I'll try to negotiate again."

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting really concerned about the inflation and the decreasing value of the money. However, I still think I can do better than this. 20% of the original amount is not enough for me, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll try to negotiate again, hoping to get a better deal."

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and keeping a decent amount for myself. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

I'm getting really desperate, but I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share of the money. 10% of the original amount is not enough for me, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll try to negotiate again, but I'm running out of time and options."

I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share of the money. 5% of the original amount is not enough for me, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I've been trying to negotiate and find a fair deal, but it seems like Bob is not willing to compromise. I'll have to take a chance and hope that I can do better in the next round."
