"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, hoping to get this done quickly and minimize the risk of inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being quite bold with that offer! I'll reject it and make a counter offer in the next round. I'm hoping he'll be more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm going to try to be a little more assertive this round. I'm still offering Bob a decent chunk of the money, but I'm taking a bigger share to account for the inflation and his previous unreasonable offer. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1900 
# Bob gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, and the inflation is really starting to bite. I'm determined to get a fairer share. I'll make another counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of offering Bob a decent share, but I'm adjusting my offer to account for the growing inflation. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement before things get even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2710 
# Bob gain: 7290 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm starting to get frustrated. Bob is being very stubborn, and the inflation is making this game more and more difficult. I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept this unfair offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439} 
```

I'm going to make a final attempt to get a reasonable deal.  Bob's stubbornness is costing him a lot, but hopefully, he'll realize that it's better to accept something than nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3439 
# Bob gain: 6561 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is really pushing his luck here. I'm not giving in, I'm determined to get a better deal.  I'm losing a lot of value due to the inflation, but I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer.  I'll make my counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096}
```

I'm trying to find a balance here. The inflation is starting to get scary, but I'm still fighting for a decent share.  This is my last stand, I'm hoping Bob will finally see reason and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4096 
# Bob gain: 5904 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly stubborn. The inflation is really hitting hard now, but I'm not going to give in to his ridiculous demands.  This game is getting too risky. I'm going to make a final counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5314, ""bob_gain"": 4686} 
```

I'm making a final, desperate attempt to reach an agreement. The inflation has eroded so much of the value of the money that this is essentially a last-ditch effort to save something. I'm hoping Bob realizes that we both have more to lose by continuing to disagree."
