"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's be realistic. This offer gives you a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
This offer is still heavily skewed in Bob's favor, especially with the inflation working against me more than him.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it before inflation eats our profits! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is a tough one! While not ideal, Bob is correct that inflation is eating into our potential gains. A 50/50 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal later or even nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
