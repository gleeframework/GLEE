"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get a smaller share and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob. My message is a straightforward proposal to split the money 60-40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can split the money more fairly. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%, let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Bob's offer is the same as mine in the first round, but with the gains adjusted for inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I would actually gain $400,000 (which is 40% of the current value of the money, not the original $1,000,000).

I'll reject this offer since it's still not in my favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Can we split it 55-45?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take a slightly larger share, 55% of the current value of the money, which is $550,000, and leaving $450,000 for Bob."
