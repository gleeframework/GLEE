Round 6

# Bob gain: 60

``` 

This is a tough situation. Ideally, we want to be getting more than 50% of the share to offset the inflation. However: 

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each round.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems content to wait it out, knowing I'm at a disadvantage.

If I reject this offer, there's a very real chance I'll end up with even less in a later round. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting the 40/60 split is likely the most logical choice at this point to avoid further losses."
