Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a fair but slightly advantageous offer in the first round.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for me than my previous one, even with the inflation penalty.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing even more money in the next round."
