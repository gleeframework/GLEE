I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  It's unlikely he'll refuse a dollar!  Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with the risk of inflation.  Accepting is the safest bet."
