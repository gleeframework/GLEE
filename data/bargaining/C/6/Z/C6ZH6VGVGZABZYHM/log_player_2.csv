Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, but I'm not going to cave. It's clear she's trying to exploit the inflation difference, but it's getting too risky for her as well now. We're running out of rounds."

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamics:**  Alice has consistently overplayed her hand, assuming I'd cave due to the inflation disadvantage. However, we're at a critical point where her greed is now a liability for her too. 
* **Ultimatum:**  This offer, while favoring me, isn't completely unreasonable. It's a clear message that I'm done negotiating and she needs to take a serious offer or risk losing everything.
* **Future Rounds:** By stating my intention to prioritize my gain, even if it leads to a stalemate, I'm introducing a credible threat.  Alice will be forced to reconsider if I reject her offers and propose increasingly lopsided deals in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11

This is pure greed from Alice. She's betting on me panicking at the last minute. I'm calling her bluff. I'll offer an even more extreme split in my favor next round. Let's see if she values her share at all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 8000,
""alice_gain"": 2000,
""message"": ""You've pushed it too far, Alice. This is my last offer. Take it or we both get nothing. Don't let your greed destroy everything.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round Pressure:** This is the last round, meaning it's now or never. Alice has to make a decision knowing this is her final chance to get anything.
* **Extreme Counter-Offer:** By offering a heavily skewed split in my favor, I'm putting maximum pressure on Alice. She's left with a stark choice: accept a small share or risk losing everything due to her stubbornness.
* **Exploiting Fear of Loss:** People are generally more averse to losing something they perceive as theirs, even if it's a small amount.  This offer plays on that fear, forcing Alice to choose between a small gain or a guaranteed loss. 
* **Message Clarity:**  The message is direct and leaves no room for interpretation.  It's a clear ultimatum, highlighting the consequences of her continued greed. 

It's a risky move, but Alice's relentless pursuit of a disproportionate share has forced this situation.  This offer represents the best chance for me to secure any winnings, even if it's less than ideal."
