Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 70/30 split is more equitable given the inflation rates. We both need to consider the value loss, and this offer gives us both a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
