"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 seems fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 60/40 seems fair initially, it's important to consider the inflation rates.  Alice's offer is much more advantageous to her due to the 20% inflation she experiences. I'll aim for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I believe a 70/30 split is more equitable given the inflation rates. We both need to consider the value loss, and this offer gives us both a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer doesn't reflect the faster rate of inflation for me. I'm proposing 55/45, which is a compromise considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still believe a 70/30 split was fairer, Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation rates.  It's better to accept this offer than risk further rounds and potential losses due to inflation."
