"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation issue, Alice. Let's meet a bit closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time.  My offer is still the most fair considering the inflation we're facing.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. This offer is fair considering the time pressure and the inflation you're dealing with. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching closer to a 50/50 split, but  I need to account for the rapid devaluation. Accepting 5200 now is barely better than getting nothing if the game goes to the final rounds. I need to signal I'm willing to risk it all for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a serious compromise on my end. We both lose if this fails. Let's settle this now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the circumstances.  We both lose if this falls through. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision, but I have to accept. With each round, the inflation eats away at my potential gain. If I reject this offer and we don't reach an agreement, I risk getting nothing. A 50/50 split now, even with the inflation, is better than gambling on an uncertain future."
