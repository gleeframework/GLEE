"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting that we start with a fair split and then see if we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair, given that the money will decrease in value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, the actual values would be:

* Alice gain: $40 * 0.8 = $32
* Bob gain: $60 * 0.8 = $48

I accept Bob's offer for the second round. Here is my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
