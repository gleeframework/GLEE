Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value.  
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob has consistently aimed for a larger share and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better in the remaining rounds. Holding out for a better deal is risky.
* **Guaranteed Return:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum, while rejecting it opens the possibility of getting zero if a deal isn't reached. 

While Alice initially aimed for a larger share, the time pressure and Bob's stubbornness make accepting the 50/50 split the most logical choice to avoid a complete loss.
