Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob's offer is actually the same as my initial offer, but with a different description. I'll reject it since I already know it's not a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll give you a smaller share, but still a good deal. Take 300k and I'll keep 700k.""

# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 700,000$ is now worth 354,400$ (48.8% of 700,000$). Bob's offer is a bit better than my previous offer, considering the inflation. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
