"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and balanced proposal, hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can't refuse! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 32 (80% of 40) in the current round. Not bad, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher gain this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm still looking for a better deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one, to see if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not convinced! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 42 is actually worth around 21.36 (48.8% of 42) in the current round. That's a pretty small amount, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll think carefully before making a decision...

  ""decision"": ""accept""
