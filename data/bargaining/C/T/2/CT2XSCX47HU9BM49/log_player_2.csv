"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to take the even split, but there's no guarantee Alice will play fair in the future rounds.  Rejecting allows me to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than an even split.  Let's try 60/40 in my favor, recognizing that the money will be worth less with each passing round."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think I deserve more given the current market conditions. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting hard.  Accepting this offer means I get at least something, and it's more than the previous round after inflation.  It's better to take what I can get now."
