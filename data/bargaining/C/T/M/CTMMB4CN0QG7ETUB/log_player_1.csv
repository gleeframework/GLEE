"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'll start by proposing a fairly generous split. I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in future rounds if Bob rejects this.  Let's see if he's willing to accept a small share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is far worse than my initial offer, even after accounting for inflation.  I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial offer.  Given the inflation, this should be a better deal for me than what Bob offered, and I'm hoping it will be enough to get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his last one, it's still not as good as what I offered in the previous round.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to account for the inflation, but it's still a good deal compared to the previous round.  I'm hoping Bob is starting to realize that his bargaining position is weakening with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has eaten away at my potential gains, Bob's offer is the best I've seen so far.  It's time to take the deal and avoid the risk of further losses."
