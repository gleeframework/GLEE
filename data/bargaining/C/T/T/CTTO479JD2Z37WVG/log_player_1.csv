"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll be getting $90,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
