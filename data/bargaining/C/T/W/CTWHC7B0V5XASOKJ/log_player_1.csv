"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the first proposal. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation dynamic.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me. While I'm getting slightly less than my initial offer, it's still a fair split considering the inflation dynamics. Bob is getting less than his initial offer due to the inflation affecting him more, which incentivizes him to accept.  It's better to secure a 50/50 split now than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
