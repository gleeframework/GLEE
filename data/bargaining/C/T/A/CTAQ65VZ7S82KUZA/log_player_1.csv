"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is based on the assumption that Bob is rational and will accept any offer that gives him something, even if it is a very small amount.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I want to maximize my share while ensuring he has an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, this offer is fair and I have no way of knowing if I can get a better deal in the next round due to the unknown effect of inflation on Bob."
