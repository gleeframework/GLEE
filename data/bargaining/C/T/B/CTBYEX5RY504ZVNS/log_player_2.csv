"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you with 10%. We can adjust in the next rounds if you like. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I think I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the money loses value for both of us.  Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that.  60/40 for me is fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it.  Even though I'm getting less than my initial offer, I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing at all."
