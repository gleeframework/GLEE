I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a 60% share, especially since I was willing to give him 20% in the first round. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to appeal to my sense of fairness, huh?

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think I've been too aggressive in my previous offers, and Bob's compromise is a reasonable one. I'll accept the offer and take 30% of the remaining $1,000,000, with Bob getting 70%. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's a decent compromise to end the game."
