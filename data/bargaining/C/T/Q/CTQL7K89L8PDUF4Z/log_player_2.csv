Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your generosity, Bob. But I think we can find a better split that works for both of us. Let's try a 60/40 split, where I take the larger share but you still get a respectable amount. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation around a 60/40 split in her favor. While it's better than her previous offer, it's still not ideal. Given the faster rate of inflation impacting my gains, I need to push for a more favorable outcome."
