"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 80/20 in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. My message to Bob is that I'm starting with a fair split, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We both get a good amount this way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, the new total is $9,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. Splitting it evenly at $5,000 each doesn't seem like a great outcome for me, especially considering the money is worth less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less after the second round, the new total is $9,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think a split closer to even is best for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less after the third round, the new total is $7,269.10.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a slightly more generous offer than before, I still think I can do better. The money is worth less with each passing round, and I'd like to get a larger share of the remaining amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less after the fourth round, the new total is $7,269.10.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get a better deal. Meet me halfway!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor, with me getting $6,500 and Bob getting $3,500. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get a better deal, and I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're both being too stubborn. This is getting risky.  Let's find a middle ground and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 40.95% less after the fifth round, the new total is $6,654.91.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, despite my initial reservations, I think it's getting too late in the game to be too picky. The money is worth significantly less with each passing round, and I'd rather take a deal that gets me some money now rather than risking everything and getting nothing."
