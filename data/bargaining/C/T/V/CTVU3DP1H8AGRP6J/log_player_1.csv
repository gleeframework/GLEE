I propose a 95/5 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point considering I'm taking the risk of being rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. Bob is being greedy and trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'll wait and see what his next offer is."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to 80%, but still leaving Bob with a reasonable 20%.  I'm confident this is a fairer offer than his last one, especially considering the inflation."

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Bob is being increasingly greedy and trying to exploit inflation. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal, especially with the limited number of rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my share again to 85%. This is a fair offer considering Bob's recent attempts to take advantage of inflation.  With the limited number of rounds left, I need to make sure I secure a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 50/50 seems fair on the surface, remember Bob's gains are worth significantly less due to inflation. I'm sticking to my strategy of waiting for a better offer, especially with the limited rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm raising my offer to 90% for myself, leaving Bob with 10%.  Inflation is hitting Bob hard, and time is running out. I need to secure a substantial share of the money before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is completely unacceptable. Bob is pushing his luck and trying to take advantage of inflation.  With limited rounds left, I need to remain firm and seek a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

With only a few rounds remaining, I'm taking a risk and proposing a 95/5 split in my favor.  This offer is likely to be rejected, but it's a necessary move to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair share of the money.  Inflation is hurting him significantly, and I need to take advantage of that to secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is absolutely ridiculous.  Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation with inflation.  I refuse to accept such a meager share, especially with so few rounds remaining.  I'm sticking to my strategy of waiting for a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 98, ""bob_gain"": 2}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to make a decisive move.  I'm proposing a 98/2 split in my favor, hoping to pressure Bob into accepting. Inflation is hitting him hard, and he knows that if he rejects, there's a high chance we both get nothing. This is a risky move, but I believe it's necessary to secure a substantial share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a blatant attempt by Bob to take advantage of the final round and the severe impact of inflation on his share.  While I understand the pressure of the situation, I refuse to accept such an unfair offer.  We're both going to end up with nothing, but I'd rather walk away with empty hands than agree to such a ludicrous deal."
