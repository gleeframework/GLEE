Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The first round is about setting expectations.  I'm willing to be more than fair, but that offer wasn't close. This is a much better deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
