Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite unfair. Let's be reasonable. I propose 70 for me and 30 for you.  This accounts for the decreasing value of the money.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point about the value decreasing.  Let's compromise. I'll take 60, and you can have 40.  This is a fairer split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
