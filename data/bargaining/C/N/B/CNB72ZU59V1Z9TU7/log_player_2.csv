"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's start with a big split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. With the money being worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I'm willing to take the risk of negotiating for a better deal. Alice's offer is too skewed in her favor, and I believe I can get a more even split. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more balanced. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'll try to find a middle ground that benefits both of us.
