"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess if needed""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. I'm also leaving the door open for us to re-evaluate and adjust if needed as we go along."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, and I think I can do better. I'm willing to give him some of the money, but 70/30 is too skewed in his favor. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a bit more, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly better deal, but I'm still holding out for a more balanced split. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm getting desperate 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm getting a bit desperate too. With the money being worth less and less each round, I think I should take what I can get. 75/25 is still a bit skewed, but it's a better deal than I've gotten so far. I'll accept this offer and hope to do better next time."
