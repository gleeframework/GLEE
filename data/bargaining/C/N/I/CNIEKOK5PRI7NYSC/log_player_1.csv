This is a tough situation, but I have to accept. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  With each round, my potential gains shrink drastically due to the 20% inflation. Waiting any longer means accepting an even worse deal.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems content to drag this out, knowing time is on his side. He's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this.

While $3,000 is significantly less than what I could have gotten earlier, it's better than accepting an even lower amount or risking getting nothing at all if the game continues."
