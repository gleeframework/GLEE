Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you started the game Alice, but I need a bit more than that.  This seems fair.""}

# Alice's message: I see you're willing to negotiate, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, the value is decreasing with each round.  Let's split it evenly and end this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, the value is decreasing, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but the clock is really working against me now. Accepting a 42/58 split is better than risking another round where I'm forced to take even less, or worse, walk away with nothing."
