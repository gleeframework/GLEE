"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to start, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad move by Bob, but I'm not willing to give up too much just yet. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less for me now, and I need to be more aggressive to make up for it. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a firmer stance, Bob! Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less, and I need to be more careful with my decisions. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'd rather take the deal now than risk going into the next round with even less valuable money."
