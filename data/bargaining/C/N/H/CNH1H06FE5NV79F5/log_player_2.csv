"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this round, but hopefully we can find a more equitable split in the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm willing to give you a larger share this round.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Alice responds to this offer. I'm ready for the next step in the game.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'd like to confirm that since we are in Round 2, if my offer is accepted, I will effectively receive 80% of the $400,000 due to the 20% decrease in value from inflation, correct? Thus, I would actually receive $320,000 in value from the original $1,000,000. Is that the correct interpretation of the game's inflation rule?"
