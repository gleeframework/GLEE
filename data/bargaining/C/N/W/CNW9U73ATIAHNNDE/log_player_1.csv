I'm going to offer a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure it's a good starting point and gives Bob something to consider.  Since we don't know how inflation affects him, it's best to err on the side of being a bit aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a lot less favorable than my initial offer, and while it's true I'm taking a 5% hit on the money, it's still a better deal for me to reject and make my own proposal. I can offer him a slightly better split to try and convince him to accept, but I'll need to do so strategically to ensure I still get a good outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to offer a 70/30 split.  Bob is likely feeling the pressure from inflation more than I am, and this gives him a small increase from his previous offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that convinces him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, inflation has hit Bob harder than I expected.  This offer represents a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the inflation factors.  Accepting will give me a stable amount, and it's better than risking further rounds and potentially getting even less."
