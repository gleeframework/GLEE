# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the split, I'll need a better deal to consider accepting.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will come back with a revised offer!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money's value decreasing significantly due to inflation, I'll need to be careful not to give away too much. Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll think it over carefully.

However, I'm not entirely convinced that this is the best deal for me. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to split it down the middle, let's see if we can find a better compromise.""
}
```

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my guns, I need a bigger share to make this worth my while!""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much more, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if we can find a middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money's value decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I'll need to be cautious not to give away too much. However, Bob's offer seems more reasonable than my previous rejection, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's hope it's a good decision!"
