"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, $2,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the compromise, and I think I can do better. I was hoping for a more significant advantage, especially considering the initial 4:1 split I proposed. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still the one who's really close to the goal!""}

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still favors me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I'll try to squeeze a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer, and I think I can do better. The 3:2 split is still too close for my liking, and I'm not willing to settle for it. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a tiny bit, but I'm still the one who's getting the lion's share!""}

I'm proposing a 9:1 split, which is a significant improvement from my previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a strong offer and accept it, but I'm not sure if he'll be willing to settle for such a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, but I'm willing to give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think I've been pushing my luck too far, and Bob's offer is starting to look more appealing. The 3:1 split is still not ideal, but considering the inflation and the fact that I've already rejected several offers, I think I should take what I can get. I'll accept this offer and hope that it's the best I can get."
