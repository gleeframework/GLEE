"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob. The message is a friendly one, hoping to get the game started quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take this offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'm now considering Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with the ratio of the split, and I think I can do better than 4:6. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, my offer is now worth even less. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You think I was too generous, but I'm willing to compromise. Will you accept this offer?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and not giving up too much to Bob."
