Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know inflation is hurting you, but I'm not feeling the pinch. This is my best offer, take it or we keep playing 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

This is a tough situation. While I want more, the inflation is killing my returns. If I reject this offer, there's a good chance I'll end up with even less in future rounds as Bob seems determined to take advantage of the situation.  It's better to accept a less-than-ideal offer now than risk an even worse outcome later."
