I'm going to propose a split of 9000 for me and 1000 for Bob. This is a pretty aggressive start, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it rather than risk getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a classic example of the ultimatum game!  I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm not happy with getting only $1000, especially since I offered him a better deal in the first round. By rejecting, I am hoping to force him to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to propose a 5500/4500 split.  After Bob's aggressive move, I think it's time to be a little more reasonable, but still leave myself with the majority of the money.  It's likely Bob will accept this offer, as it is more fair than his last offer and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
