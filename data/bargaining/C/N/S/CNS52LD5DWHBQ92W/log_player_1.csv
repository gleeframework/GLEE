"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, Bob. This is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is 25% of the initial amount. This leaves me with $750,000, which is 75% of the initial amount. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money equally. We both have a better chance of getting something this way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $750,000 in the previous round is now worth $600,000 in terms of purchasing power.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the current value of the money is now 64% of the initial amount (1 - 0.2)^12 = 0.64.

Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 512000,
  ""bob_gain"": 488000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, Bob. Let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $488,000, which is a bit more than half of the current value of the money."
