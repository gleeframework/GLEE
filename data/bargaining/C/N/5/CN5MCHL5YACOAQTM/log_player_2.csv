Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the previous offer. This is a counter-proposal that's a bit closer to the middle while still acknowledging the impact of inflation on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to inch closer to an even split, knowing that the longer the game goes on, the less significant the difference between our gains becomes. However, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal for myself."
