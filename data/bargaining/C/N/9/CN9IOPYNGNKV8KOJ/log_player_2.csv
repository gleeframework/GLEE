Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, the deal won't get better for you 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Due to the 20% inflation per round, the value of Bob's potential gain is rapidly decreasing.  Waiting any longer means he'll be getting even less.
* **Alice's Strong Position:** Alice is aware of Bob's predicament and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better in the future.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Accepting a smaller share is still better than continuing to lose money to inflation and potentially ending up with nothing if no agreement is reached."
