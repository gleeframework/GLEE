Alice's offer:

Let's see if we can get a better deal."

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'll take 55% and leave you with 45%. This gives us both a good starting point.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take a little less than my first offer - 56% -  and you get 44%. This seems fair considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting risky, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  I'll accept."
