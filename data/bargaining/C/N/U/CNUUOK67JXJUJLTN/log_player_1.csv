"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, as I'm still getting a relatively small share of the pie. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle wasn't bad, but I can do better""}

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split, where I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time to make a fair deal, no more playing games! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my gains due to inflation, but I think Bob's offer is a fair one. We're splitting the money 50/50, which is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
