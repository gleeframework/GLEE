{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate.

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'm not willing to accept a 65/35 split, and I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

I'll think carefully before making my next move..."

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again, and I'm starting to worry that I'll end up with nothing if I don't make a better counteroffer. However, I don't want to give up yet. I'll try to make one more push for a better deal.
