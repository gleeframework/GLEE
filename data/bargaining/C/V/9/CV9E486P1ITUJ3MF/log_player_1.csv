"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, I'll take that into account when evaluating the offer.

In Round 2, the total amount is 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000.

With Bob's offer, I would gain $3,000, which is equivalent to 37.5% of the original $10,000, and Bob would gain $7,000, which is equivalent to 70% of the original $10,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
