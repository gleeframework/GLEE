"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6,000, which is 60% of the total amount. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is a fair compromise, considering the inflation. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my share should be higher""
}
```

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, I'm increasing my share to $6,500, while offering Bob $3,500. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  We both lose a lot with each passing round. A 50-50 split is the best outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're losing value fast, it's time to settle""
}
```

Since Bob's share is losing value rapidly due to inflation, I'm increasing my share to $7,000 and offering Bob $3,000. I'm trying to emphasize to Bob that the longer he waits, the less value he'll get, so it's in his best interest to accept this offer."

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is killing your share, don't wait any longer""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $7,500 and offering Bob $2,500. With the inflation rate, Bob's share is rapidly losing value, and I'm trying to persuade him to accept this offer before it's too late."
