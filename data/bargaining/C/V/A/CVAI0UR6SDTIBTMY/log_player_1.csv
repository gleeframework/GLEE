"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can start with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factored in, I'm not as eager to accept Bob's offer as I was in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but still keep a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but still not there! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take its toll! With Bob's offer, I'm getting a slightly smaller share than before, but it's still a decent offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll take it, since the offers are getting progressively better and I don't want to risk going to Round 5 with a smaller share."
