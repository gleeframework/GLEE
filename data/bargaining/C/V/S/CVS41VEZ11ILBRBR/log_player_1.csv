"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's still a decent chunk of the total. My message is a bit playful, trying to entice Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and end this! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the extra $400,000 I was initially offered. I'll have to think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50/50 split, I'll try to make an even more generous offer to try to sway him. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, take the deal and let's be done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but still a significant amount. My message is trying to appeal to Bob's sense of greed, hoping he'll take the deal and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round, but I'm not getting any younger!

Considering Bob's previous offers, I think he's trying to find a sweet spot where I'll accept. Meeting in the middle sounds like a reasonable compromise, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
