"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, which is a 4:1 ratio. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see how Bob responds."
