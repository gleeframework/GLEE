"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle and avoid risking further losses with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still heavily favoring herself in this deal. While she's making concessions, it's not enough to offset the rapid inflation hitting my potential earnings.  I need to push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a couple more rounds."
