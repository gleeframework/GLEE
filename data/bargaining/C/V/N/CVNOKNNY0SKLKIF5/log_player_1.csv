"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the total amount. I'm taking the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective amounts.

My gain of 300,000 dollars is worth 95% of 300,000, which is 285,000 dollars.
Bob's gain of 700,000 dollars is worth 80% of 700,000, which is 560,000 dollars.

Considering the effective amounts, I think this offer is more favorable to me than my previous offer. I accept this offer.
