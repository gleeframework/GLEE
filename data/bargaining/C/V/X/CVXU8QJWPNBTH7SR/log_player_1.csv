"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering we have 12 rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're going for a big cut, I'll take a smaller share this round 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, that's a big cut!

I'll have to think carefully... But considering the inflation, I'd rather not wait for a better offer and take what I can get. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
