"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept my generous offer and let's end this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's a huge imbalance, and even though I don't know the inflation effect on Alice, I have 12 rounds to try and get a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. This is a fair deal that avoids the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're not getting a free ride, Bob. I'm taking what I can while I can! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While I'm not getting a great deal, I'm still better off waiting. Inflation is hurting, but I have a chance to get a better deal if I keep rejecting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's try to be a little more reasonable, Alice. This offer is a compromise, and I think we can both get a fair share of the money without letting inflation eat away at it too much.""}
