# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to look out for my own interests too. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her due to inflation.  We can likely push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a very generous offer considering the inflation working against you. Let's settle this now and both benefit.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to the point where Alice's desperation might outweigh her desire for a larger share. This offer is a significant jump from our previous, giving her a chance to secure a decent amount before inflation eats away more of her potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's time to be realistic.  This offer is the best you're going to get considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally feeling the heat of inflation and her offer is reasonable considering the circumstances. Holding out for more might backfire as she gets increasingly desperate and potentially offers even less favorable terms. Accepting now secures a decent gain while avoiding the risk of walking away with nothing."
