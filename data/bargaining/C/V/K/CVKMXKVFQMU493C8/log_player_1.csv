"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'm not as excited about the 20 dollars as I was about the 60 dollars initially. On the other hand, Bob's gain of 80 dollars is still a significant amount, considering it's worth 20% less than his initial gain.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering to take 40 dollars and leaving 60 dollars for Bob."
