"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should flip that last offer, Alice. 60 for me, 40 for you.  Seems fair to me! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, this offer is equivalent to Bob offering me 36.4 (40 * 0.91) and taking 63.6 (60 / 0.9).

I'll reject this offer because it's not as good as my initial offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about 55 for me and 45 for you? It's a slight improvement for me, but I'm still willing to give you a good deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the initial $100, and I'll take the remaining 55%."
