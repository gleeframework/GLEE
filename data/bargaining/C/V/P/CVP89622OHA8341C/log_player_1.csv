"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said fair split, let's see if you agree 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to test my commitment to a fair split. I'll accept this offer, but I'll make a note to try to negotiate a better deal in future rounds.
