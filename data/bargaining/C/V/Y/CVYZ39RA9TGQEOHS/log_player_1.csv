"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but I'm willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to set a low bar for his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair proposal!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer, and we can split the $1,000,000 down the middle. It's a fair and reasonable split, and I'm happy to end the game here!"
