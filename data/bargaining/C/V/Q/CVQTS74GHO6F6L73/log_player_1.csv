"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can both walk away happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a better share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm actually getting a worse deal than in the first round.

However, I'm not sure what the inflation rate will be in future rounds, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal later on. So, I'll accept this offer for now.
