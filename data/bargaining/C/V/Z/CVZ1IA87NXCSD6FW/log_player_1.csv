"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. This way, I'll get a bigger share, but I'll have a chance to negotiate further in future rounds if I want to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I think I can do better than this.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation has taken a toll, and the money is worth even less now. I'll aim to get a bigger share while still leaving room for negotiation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value! With the money being worth 48.8% less than initially, I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

Bob's offer is 50/50, which is a significant concession from his previous offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
