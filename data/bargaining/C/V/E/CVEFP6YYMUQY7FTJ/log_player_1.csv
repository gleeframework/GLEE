I propose a 50/50 split. This seems like the fairest and most likely to be accepted in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it's a small change from the previous round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself. I'm willing to take the risk and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
```

I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm adjusting the split slightly to reflect my position and the increasing pressure of time."
