Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about inflation hitting her harder, this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, even considering the devaluation.  I need to push for a larger share, as time is also working against me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be real, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, but she's also stubborn.  Offering a 50/50 split sends a strong message:  

* **Fairness:**  It's objectively the most equitable solution.
* **Urgency:**  There's no more room for games, and this needs to be settled now.

This offer might seem risky, but the alternative is continuing to haggle with dwindling returns. A firm stance is necessary at this stage."
