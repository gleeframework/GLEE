9000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can work something out in the next rounds if you think that's too much.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,That's a bit greedy Alice! How about we go 60/40? It's a good deal considering the inflation.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Okay, I'll compromise a little. 70/30 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation.  Let's get this done.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm offering you 4500, which is a good chunk considering it's worth less and less for you each round.  55/45 seems fair!",Bob,4,
