I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation and limited rounds. It's better than risking getting nothing."
