I'm going to reject this offer. I understand Alice wants to be ""fair"", but I want a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm still going to reject this offer. Even though Alice is giving me slightly more, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing due to inflation.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than last time, but the value of the money is declining rapidly.  Let's find a compromise before it's too late.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, let's meet in the middle... slightly in my favor 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and Alice's offer is not nearly good enough to justify accepting it.  I need to hold out for a better deal before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""We're getting close to the end, and the value of the money is diminishing quickly.  Let's find a compromise that's fair to both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Seriously, let's just split it almost evenly before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer.  The value of the money is falling fast, and even though Alice is offering a ""nearly even"" split, the value of my share is very low.  I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value of the money is getting very low. Let's be practical and make a deal that gives us both something. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fine, let's just split it down the middle. Last chance 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

At this point, the value of the money is so low that even a 50/50 split is a better outcome than getting nothing.  I'll accept Alice's offer."
