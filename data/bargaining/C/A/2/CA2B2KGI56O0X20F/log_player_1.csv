This is a tough one! While I'd like to get more, here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Inflation is hurting Bob:** Every round, the value of Bob's potential gain decreases. This makes him more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on.
* **50/50 is fair:** While I had the advantage initially, Bob is correct that a 50/50 split is fair. Holding out for more might make him dig in his heels.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob might offer me even more next round, but there's also a chance he'll offer less.  It's a risk I'm not willing to take at this point."
