"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected the offer, the money is still worth the original $1,000,000 for me, but it's worth 5% less for Alice, which is $950,000.

I'll make a new offer:
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, so I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 19% less for me, the $580,000 is equivalent to $735,000 in the first round, and the $420,000 is equivalent to $490,000 in the first round.

I'll accept this offer.
