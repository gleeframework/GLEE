"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'm keeping $600,000, which is 60% of the original amount. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me! 

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually the same as my original offer, but with a different label. 

I'll reject this offer since it's not a new proposal, and I'm hoping for a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better ratio. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to mirror my previous offer again!

However, considering the inflation, I'm getting a better deal than I initially thought. Since my gain is worth 27.1% less, I'll actually be getting around 418,180.5 (550,000 * 0.7559), which is more than my previous offer. And Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less, so he's getting around 473,519.5 (550,000 * 0.8592).

I'll accept this offer since it's a better deal for me, considering the inflation.
