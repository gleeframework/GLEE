"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a much worse deal for me than my initial offer, and I don't believe Bob will be able to make a better offer in the next round.  I'm willing to wait and see what happens."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a slightly less generous split than my first offer, but still hoping to secure a deal before the inflation eats away at the money too much. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still trying to take a large share, but I'm not ready to accept this deal. The inflation is hitting hard, but I believe there's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm sticking to my guns. We're getting close to the halfway point, and I'm willing to bet Bob will start getting nervous about the potential for us both getting nothing. I'm offering him a large share, but it's still better than ending up with zero."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

The inflation is getting serious now. Even though I'd prefer more, this is a decent offer, and I'm not sure I'll get a better one in the next round.  I'll take it."
