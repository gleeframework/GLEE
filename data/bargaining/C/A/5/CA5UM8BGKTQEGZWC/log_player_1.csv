"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
