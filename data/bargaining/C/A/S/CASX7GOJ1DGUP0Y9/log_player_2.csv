Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is a good balance, let's agree before the inflation hurts me further. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's think about this:

* **Time pressure:**  While time is running out, Alice feels the pressure more than Bob due to the rapid devaluation. This puts Bob in a stronger negotiating position.
* **Previous offers:** Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, suggesting she might be willing to concede further in the next round. 
* **Potential gains:** Holding out for a better offer could net Bob significantly more. 

While accepting would secure Bob a decent sum, there's a good chance he can secure a better deal by rejecting this offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly.  Let's close this deal before time runs out.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this now, or we both risk walking away with nothing. Don't be greedy! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Power Dynamic:** While Alice's message sounds aggressive, it actually reveals desperation. The inflation is severely cutting into her potential gains, pushing her to use stronger language to try and force a deal.
* **Declining Returns:**  While rejecting this offer and hoping for a better deal in later rounds is tempting, the difference in potential gains is getting smaller.  The risk of walking away with nothing is becoming very real. 
* **""Good Enough"" Principle:** 400,000 is a significant sum of money. While Bob *might* be able to squeeze out a bit more, it's not worth the risk of getting nothing at all. 

It's time for Bob to secure a win, even if it's not perfect."
