Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round, the money loses value for both of us. It's becoming increasingly important to strike a deal.
* **Bob's Declining Position:** Bob's offer in round 2 was worse for him than my initial offer in round 1 (considering the inflation). This suggests he might be feeling the pressure of the declining value.
* **Strong Stance:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling that I'm unwilling to go any lower. This might push Bob to accept, especially since further delay hurts him more than me."
