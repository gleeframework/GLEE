"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent share, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think I can get a bit more. Let's try 60/40 for me. We can work from there if you don't like it. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* Alice gain: 60 * 0.95 = 57
* Bob gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36

It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's see if you can do better.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
