"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not going for 50/50 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 4,000 to 6,000 split. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but still leaves me with a decent chunk of the money. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for my patience 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can still do better than a 45/55 split. I'm starting to think that Bob is being a bit too optimistic about his share, given the inflation factor. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my edge.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52/48 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but still keeps me ahead. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob feels like he's getting a good deal, but I'm not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about negotiating, let's try a different approach 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. I think I've been pushing for a good deal, but Bob's offer of a 48/52 split is actually pretty reasonable, considering the inflation factor. I'm willing to accept it and move on."
