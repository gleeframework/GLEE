Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is a more fair starting point, considering the inflation will impact you more heavily as the rounds continue. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51
