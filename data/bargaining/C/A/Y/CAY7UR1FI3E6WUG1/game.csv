60.0,40.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It seems fair considering the time pressure and the fact that the value decreases for me each round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
49.0,51.0,"I think a 51/49 split is a more fair starting point, considering the inflation will impact you more heavily as the rounds continue. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your previous offer wasn't reasonable given the time pressure. Let's settle this â€“ 55/45 seems like a fair compromise.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
