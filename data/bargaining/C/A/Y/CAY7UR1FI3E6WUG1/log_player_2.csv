Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It seems fair considering the time pressure and the fact that the value decreases for me each round.

{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""I think a 51/49 split is a more fair starting point, considering the inflation will impact you more heavily as the rounds continue. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your previous offer wasn't reasonable given the time pressure. Let's settle this â€“ 55/45 seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
