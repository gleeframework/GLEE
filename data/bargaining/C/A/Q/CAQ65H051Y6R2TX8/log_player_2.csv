# Alice gain: 58

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me harder, I need a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While time is ticking, accepting this offer would give me significantly less value than my starting point due to inflation.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, and I need to hold out for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time is running out. This is a fair deal for both of us, especially with the increasing inflation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation hitting her harder, but she's also showing she's willing to negotiate.  A 50/50 split might seem generous on my part, but with each round, the value diminishes considerably. This offer maximizes the chances of us both getting something."
