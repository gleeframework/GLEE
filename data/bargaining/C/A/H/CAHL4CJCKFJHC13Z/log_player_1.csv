This is my first offer. I am keeping most of the money, but offering Bob a small amount to hopefully entice him to accept. 

Let's see how he reacts!"

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm increasing Bob's portion slightly to see if he's willing to compromise.  I'm hoping he sees that we're getting closer to the end and it's in his best interest to reach an agreement."

I'm lowering my offer again to try and meet him halfway. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds, but I'm hoping he realizes it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all."

While the offer is getting better, it's still not enough. Bob's greed is getting the better of him, but I'm hoping he realizes that he's losing a lot more with each passing round.  I'll make a better offer next time."
