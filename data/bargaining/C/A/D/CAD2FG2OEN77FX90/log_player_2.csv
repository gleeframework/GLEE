"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good chunk of money. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better offer or make a counteroffer that benefits me more. The current offer doesn't seem fair, with Alice getting almost twice as much as I do. I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to potentially get a more equal share. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This offer is more balanced, considering the inflation risk we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. This offer still gives you a significant amount while acknowledging the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm going to reject this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better share. Alice's offer has improved slightly from the first round, but I'm still not satisfied with the distribution. Given the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's share, I think she might be willing to compromise further in the next rounds. I'll take the risk and see what the next round brings!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to make a slightly more generous offer. However, I still believe I deserve a larger portion due to the lesser effect of inflation on my end. Let's settle this before the money loses more value!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting serious. I'm losing a significant chunk of money with each rejection. This offer is a compromise, and it's the best I can do considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm going to reject this offer again because, despite the significant impact of inflation on both our shares, I still believe I can push for a slightly better deal. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her message indicates that she's willing to compromise. Given the substantial decrease in the value of her share, I think she might be willing to meet me closer to the middle in the next round. I'll take the risk and see what the next round brings!"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the massive impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to make a final compromise. A 50/50 split is the fairest offer I can make, given the circumstances. If you reject this, I'll have to assume you're not interested in finding a mutually beneficial solution, and we'll both end up with nothing.""}"
