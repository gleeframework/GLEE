"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split considering the risk and potential loss due to inflation. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bigger portion. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
