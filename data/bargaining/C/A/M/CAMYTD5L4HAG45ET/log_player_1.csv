Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to be fair. Let's split it 55/45.  It's a better deal for both of us than your offer, and I think we can end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
