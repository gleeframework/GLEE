"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slight majority to ensure I don't get stuck with less in the long run.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the potential for inflation. It gives us both a decent share, and leaves room for future negotiations if we don't reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split, as I think I can do better. The inflation factor is already affecting the value of the money, and I'd like to wait for a better offer. I'll make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a majority. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I can still protect my interests in case of further inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining $4,000."
