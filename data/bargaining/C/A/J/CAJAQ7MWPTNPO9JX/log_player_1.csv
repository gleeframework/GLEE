Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a solution where we both get a fair share. This is my final offer.

# Bob gain: 60

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for you with each round. Accepting $40 now is better than risking even less in a potential round 5.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob has labeled this as his ""final offer"".  There's a strong chance he won't budge further, forcing a worse outcome for you in a later round.

It's a tough decision, but the longer the game goes on, the more the odds are stacked against you due to inflation."
