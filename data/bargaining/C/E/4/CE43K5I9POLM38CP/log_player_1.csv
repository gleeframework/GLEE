"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go 60/40 in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If Bob's gain is worth 20% less, that means he's effectively gaining 80% of the original value. So, his gain of $6,000 is equivalent to $4,800 in the first round.

Since I'm gaining $4,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, I'm effectively gaining $4,000 in the first round as well.

Considering the 60-40 split in Bob's favor, I'm actually gaining less than I initially proposed. I'd like to counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split in your favor. I'll counter with a 55/45 split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% less in each of the two previous rounds), I need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

If the money is worth 40% less, that means I'll need to propose a smaller amount to achieve the same value as before. Let's assume I want to keep the same 55/45 split as my counteroffer.

To maintain the 55/45 split, I'll propose a smaller amount for myself, taking into account the 40% reduction in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise on the split. This 55/45 split should be more palatable.""
}
```"
