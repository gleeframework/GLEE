Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split the money in a 6:4 ratio, but I'm open to negotiation.  If we keep rejecting each other's offers, the value of the money will keep decreasing, which is bad for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
