Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a large share, but I want to ensure Bob gets something to incentivize him to accept. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial offer. While I understand the effects of inflation, I am willing to gamble and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly smaller share to Bob this round.  While his offer was significantly lower than my initial offer, the inflation factor is starting to kick in. I'm hoping that he'll see the value in accepting a small share now before things get even worse for him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to significantly impact both of us. Bob's offer is now a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome given the current inflation rates. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice to ensure we both get something."
