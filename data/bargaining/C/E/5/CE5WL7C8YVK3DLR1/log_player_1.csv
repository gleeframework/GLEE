"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nSince this is the first round, I'll aim for a relatively even split, slightly favoring myself. I'll offer Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a reasonable starting point. The message is a casual way to initiate the negotiation, implying that this division is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic about the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer is not satisfactory, considering the relatively even split I initially proposed and the fact that inflation affects his gain more significantly. Accepting this would mean I lose more value over time compared to him. It's strategic to reject and make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us, aiming to find a more balanced division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the time value, let's adjust""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both our gains, I'll adjust my initial offer slightly, still favoring myself but acknowledging the decrease in value over time. Since Bob's gain is affected more by inflation, I'll offer him a bit less than in the first round, but still aim for a division that could be seen as reasonable, considering the circumstances. The message hints at the fact that we both lose value over time, suggesting a compromise that takes this into account."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, especially on Bob's, his offer becomes more acceptable. The difference in the value we each lose over time makes his proposal relatively more favorable to me than it would have been in earlier rounds. Given that he frames this as his final offer and the decreasing value of money, it seems prudent to accept this division rather than risking further loss of value in subsequent rounds."
