I'm offering Bob a small share to start, hoping he'll accept and we both get something.  Since the money is worth less to him with each round, I think he might be inclined to take it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy!  I'm going to reject this offer.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next few rounds, especially with the inflation working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time.  It's fair, and with inflation continuing to hurt Bob more than me, I think it's a good compromise.  I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept before the money becomes even less valuable to him."
