"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000. This seems like a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as I'm getting a significantly smaller share of the money. I was hoping for a more equal split, and this offer is quite lopsided. I'll reject it and hope to do better in the next round."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. Although I'm getting a slightly larger share than in his previous offer, I'm still not getting a fair deal. The difference between our gains is still quite large, and I'm hoping to do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting a bit frustrated with Bob's offers. Although I'm getting a slightly smaller share, I'm still not getting a fair deal. The difference between our gains is still quite large, and I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."

I'm trying to make one last attempt to find a compromise and get a fair split. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a more equal split. This is my final offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
