"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and can discuss further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a generous offer, but I'm hoping for a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $3,000 (down from $6,000)
* Bob gain: $7,000 (down from $8,000)

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offer from Bob, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800 and keeping $4,200 for myself. The message is a compromise offer, acknowledging Bob's previous message and trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $3,600 (down from $6,000 in the first round, and taking into account the 27.1% decrease from the previous round)
* Bob gain: $4,500 (down from $8,000 in the first round, and taking into account the 27.1% decrease from the previous round)

Considering the decreasing value of the money and Bob's message, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise.
