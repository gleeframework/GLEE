"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I propose a split of 990,000 for me and 10,000 for Bob.  I'm starting with a generous offer, knowing that the money will be worth less with each round.  I hope Bob sees the value in accepting this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 940000, ""bob_gain"": 60000}
``` 

I'm reducing my share slightly to 940,000, but still offering a significant amount to Bob (60,000).  With each passing round, the value of the money diminishes.  I hope Bob recognizes the need to reach an agreement before the value erodes too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 885000, ""bob_gain"": 115000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 885,000 but still offering a considerable amount to Bob (115,000).  We are quickly approaching the point where both of us will get nothing. I hope Bob will be reasonable and accept this offer."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 830000, ""bob_gain"": 170000}
```

I'm offering 830,000 to myself and 170,000 to Bob. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it's still a substantial amount for Bob, considering the inflation. We need to make a deal soon, as the value of the money is rapidly shrinking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 170000 
# Bob gain: 830000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still rejecting this offer. While it's a significant amount for me, I still believe that there is a possibility for a more favorable outcome for both of us. The inflation is taking a toll, but I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. We still have a few rounds to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 775000, ""bob_gain"": 225000}
```

I'm offering 775,000 to myself and 225,000 to Bob. This is the last chance to negotiate before the value of the money drops even further.  It's time to be realistic, and we need to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 225000

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

This is my final offer. We're running out of time, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. I'm offering 720,000 for myself and 280,000 for Bob. It's a fair compromise, considering the inflation. Let's agree and secure something before it's too late."
