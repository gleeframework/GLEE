"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm the one making the proposal this round. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Since I'm the one who made the initial offer and Bob is making the proposal this round, I think it's only fair that the split is closer to 50-50.

However, I'll accept this offer for now, hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise in future rounds.
