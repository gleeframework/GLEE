"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk for myself.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting strong, be prepared to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is coming out strong!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $10 is actually worth $9 (90% of $10) and Bob's gain of $90 is worth $85.50 (90% of $95).

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount. I'll accept this offer.
