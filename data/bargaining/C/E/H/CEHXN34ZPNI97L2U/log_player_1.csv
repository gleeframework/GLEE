"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. I'm willing to accept $5500, leaving you with $4500.  Let's make this quick and avoid losing too much to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
