"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still a fair split. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, the actual values are:

* My gain: 4000 * 0.95 = 3800
* Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.95 = 5700

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the actual values are:

* My gain: 5000 * 0.8585 = 4291
* Bob's gain: 5000 * 0.8585 = 4291

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
