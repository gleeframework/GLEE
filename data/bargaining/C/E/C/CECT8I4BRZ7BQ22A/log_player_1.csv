"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60 and you can take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a relatively fair start to the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. How about I take 55 and you take 45? It's still fair, but we both get a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is the best I can get. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50/50 this time.""}

I'm trying to be more flexible and propose a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept this more reasonable offer."
