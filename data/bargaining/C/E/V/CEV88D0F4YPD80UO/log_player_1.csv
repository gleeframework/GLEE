I'm going for a pretty generous offer in the first round.  I want to see if Bob is willing to be cooperative or if he's going to try to take advantage of the inflation.  900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate if he rejects it.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me, even considering the inflation.  I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm hoping that the inflation will make him more willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a 400,000 split.  He rejected my generous offer last round, so I'm taking a tougher stance. The inflation has taken a bite out of my potential winnings, so I'm aiming for a more even split. I'll be happy to negotiate further, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one!  After the inflation, Bob's offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted.  However,  with each round, the value of the money drops drastically.  It is becoming increasingly important to finalize the deal and avoid further inflation, and Bob's offer still leaves me with a substantial amount.  I'll accept this and be done with it."
