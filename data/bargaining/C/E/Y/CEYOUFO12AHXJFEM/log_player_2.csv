"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the 10% inflation rate for me, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to negotiate for a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll aim for a higher percentage. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, considering the inflation rate.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is hurting both of us, so a 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one. Considering the inflation rates, a 50/50 split might not be as fair as it seems, since the money is worth less to me with each passing round. However, I also don't want to risk losing everything if we can't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds.

Since the money is already worth 19% less to me, and 9.75% less to Alice, I'll have to weigh my options carefully. But considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I can try to negotiate for a slightly better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round! I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes the inflation rates into account."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that considers the inflation rates. Since the money is worth 19% less to me and 9.75% less to Alice, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate for the loss. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split. Let's try to come to an agreement before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need a larger share than 4200.  This offer is closer to a 50/50 split, which I think is the fairest option given the inflation we're both experiencing. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is building! With the money worth 34.39% less to me and 18.55% less to Alice, every round counts. Alice's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, but I still think I can try to negotiate for a slightly better deal.

Considering the significant decrease in value for me, I'll have to weigh the risks carefully. If I reject this offer, I might end up with nothing if we can't agree within the remaining rounds. On the other hand, accepting this offer would guarantee me $5500, albeit worth less than its original value.

After careful consideration, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take the $5500, even though it's worth less than its original value. The risk of ending up with nothing is too great, and I think this is a relatively fair compromise given the inflation rates."
