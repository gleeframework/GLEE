Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on with the dwindling rounds, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of potential earnings, even considering inflation.  It's better to hold out for a better offer, as accepting this sets a precedent that Alice can lowball."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a near even split to end this now. Don't be greedy."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a serious factor, and the effects of inflation are growing. Offering a near even split puts significant pressure on Alice. If she rejects this, it shows she is willing to risk it all for a marginally better gain."
