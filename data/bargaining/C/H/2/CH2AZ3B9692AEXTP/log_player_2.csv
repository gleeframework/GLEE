Let's see if we can get a better deal!  I'm not so sure about losing money just because I'm playing this game."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm not sure about your 'fairness' Alice, but this seems like a good starting point for a fair deal. Let's see if you're willing to compromise.""}

# Alice's message: The deal's getting worse for you, Bob. Time to be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not convinced by Alice's ""fairness"" argument.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This offer accounts for the inflation and shows that I'm willing to compromise.""}
