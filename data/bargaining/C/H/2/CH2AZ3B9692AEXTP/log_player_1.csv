Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This offer accounts for the inflation and shows that I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Inflation:** Bob is experiencing significant inflation, making his potential gains less valuable with each round. This weakens his bargaining position.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Bob in subsequent rounds. He might become even more reluctant to offer favorable terms as his position weakens.
* **Fairness:** While you aimed for a higher share initially, a 50/50 split is objectively fair, especially considering the inflationary pressure on Bob. 

Accepting now secures a reasonable outcome and avoids the risk of walking away with less if negotiations completely break down."
