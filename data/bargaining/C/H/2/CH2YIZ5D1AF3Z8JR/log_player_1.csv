I'm offering Bob a small share to start, hoping he'll be agreeable. It's important to secure the deal early on, before the inflation really kicks in!  Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy!  It's true that the money is worth less, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of.  I'll counter with a more fair offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a fair 50/50 split.  I'm hoping Bob will see reason and accept this offer before the inflation gets any worse."
