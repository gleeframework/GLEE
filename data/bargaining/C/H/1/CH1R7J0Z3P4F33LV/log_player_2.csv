"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I take the lion's share, you get a decent starting point.  What do you say?

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a bit too early to accept such a lopsided deal.  Let's see if I can get a better share.  I'll try proposing a more balanced division in the next round."

Round 2

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's both get a good chunk of this money.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it more evenly this time. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to make this worth it for me. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice is still offering a significant imbalance, and the value of the money is decreasing. I'll try to push for a more equal share in the next round."
