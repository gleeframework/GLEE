Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,

}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to mirror my previous offer. I'll have to think strategically about this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better in the next round. The inflation is working in my favor, so I'll try to get a better deal next time."

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 460,000$ and keeping 540,000$ for myself, trying to find a compromise."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split seems like the fairest solution. We both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a fair offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. The inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly, and I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best option for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. The inflation has reduced the value of the money by 14.26% from the original amount, and I'm not sure if I want to settle for a smaller share. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is still eating away at the value of the money. I'll have to be strategic about my next offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, Bob. Let's see if you'll take it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 510,000$ and keeping 490,000$ for myself, trying to give him a slight advantage in the hopes that he'll accept this offer."
