Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,

}
```

Your turn!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 80%? I'll give you 60%, but I think I deserve more than 40%. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $10,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 40% offer, but I'll consider it. I'll try to negotiate further.
