Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split!  I'm feeling generous, but I want to make sure I get the lion's share. ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm not happy with this offer! It's a huge drop from my previous proposal, and even though I have to account for inflation, it still feels unfair.  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer down a bit to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a good deal.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
