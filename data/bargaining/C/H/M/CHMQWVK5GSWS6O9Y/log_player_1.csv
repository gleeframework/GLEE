"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a classic negotiation scenario, and a good strategy for Alice is to start with a proposal that is heavily in her favor.  While Bob might not accept this first offer, it establishes a starting point. We'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would ideally like to have more than 5000, accepting this offer is the best option. Inflation means any further rounds will only reduce the value of the money I receive, and there's no guarantee that Bob will offer me more."
