{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time. We can work out a better deal next round.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more equitable split, the inflation is working against me significantly. Accepting this offer at least guarantees some money, unlike risking it all by rejecting and potentially ending up with nothing."
