"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This way, we can both get a decent amount of money and avoid the hassle of negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  This offer is a bit more fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $4,000 and Bob will take $6,000. It's a fair split, and I'm willing to move on with this offer."
