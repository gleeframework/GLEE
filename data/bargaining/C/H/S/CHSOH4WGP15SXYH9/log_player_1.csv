"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to offer a 60/40 split. This gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves you with a significant portion.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement and avoid further rounds, as the value of the money decreases with each passing turn. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
