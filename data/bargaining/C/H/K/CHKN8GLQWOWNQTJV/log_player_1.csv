Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation in mind, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, I need a bit more to account for inflation!""
}

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his previous offer, but I'll have to consider the impact of inflation on my gain.

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether 45 is enough to compensate for the loss in value.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of my potential gain, I'll aim to increase my share to make up for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I need a bit more to keep up with the inflation, 60 seems fair!""
}
```"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 35, I think this is a good compromise considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll have to be cautious and think carefully about whether 35 is enough to accept.

However, considering the decreasing value of the money, I think 35 might be a reasonable compromise. I'll decide to accept this offer.
