This offer is incredibly unfair. There's no way I'm accepting that!  Let's see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to try a much fairer split this time. I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give Alice a decent portion. Let's see if she'll accept this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still incredibly unfair.  While my gains are slightly better, hers are still disproportionately large. I'm not going to settle for this. Let's see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

This time, I'm going for a 50/50 split.  We're both taking a significant risk by letting the rounds go on, so I'm hoping this offer is fair enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not fair enough.  I'm willing to give up a little more to try to reach a compromise, but I'm not going to settle for less than 45% of the money.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal before the inflation becomes too much of a problem."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice a slightly larger share, but I'm sticking to my minimum of 45%. I'm hopeful that we can reach a deal before the inflation makes things too difficult for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse and worse! While it's a slight improvement from the last round, I'm still not willing to settle for less than 45% of the money. The inflation is becoming a real issue now, but I'm determined to negotiate a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm sticking to a minimum of 40%.  This is the last offer I can make without losing too much to inflation. Hopefully Alice will finally see reason and accept this."
