Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round.  1000 dollars is a low offer, and I'm willing to take a chance to see if I can get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a fair and reasonable offer, and I believe Alice will accept it."
