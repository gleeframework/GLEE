"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can call it a day?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still want to get as much as I can.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50/50 split. The money is worth less, but I still want to get the majority of it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, so take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm trying to squeeze out as much as I can from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give you everything. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, but I still need to get as much as I can.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $600,000 is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation."
