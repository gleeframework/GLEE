Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure, but I still think my share should be slightly higher. Meeting in the middle won't account for the difference in inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While time is running out, Alice is not significantly shifting her position. Accepting now would mean losing out on a significant portion of the initial value due to the rapidly increasing inflation for Bob. It's worth risking another round to see if Alice will make a more substantial move towards a truly fair split."
