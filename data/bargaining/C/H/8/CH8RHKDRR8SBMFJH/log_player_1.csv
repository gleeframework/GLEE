"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the initial amount.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 2000 / 0.8 = 2500
Bob gain: 8000 / 0.8 = 10,000

I don't think that's a very generous offer from Bob. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
