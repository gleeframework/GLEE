Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While far from ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  With each round, the value of the money significantly decreases for Bob. Accepting $420,000 now is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting an even worse deal.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice knows Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation.  She's unlikely to offer anything significantly better, especially since she's aware of Bob's previous ""final offer.""
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a massive risk. If Bob doesn't secure a better deal in the next round, he stands to lose even more to inflation.

**It's important to note:** This was a tough decision. Ideally, a more agreeable split could have been reached earlier. However, Alice played her hand well, leveraging the inflation factor to her advantage."
