"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority this time""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but also taking a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'll take some too! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about giving up 20% of the initial 100$, but considering the inflation and the fact that I'll be getting 80% of the remaining value, I'll accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
