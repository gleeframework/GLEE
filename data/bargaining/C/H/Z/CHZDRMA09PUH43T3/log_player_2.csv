**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate as the rounds progress and inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer is better than her previous one, I'm still confident I can secure a better deal.  We're past the halfway point, and it's time to apply more pressure."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer Alice. The clock is ticking, and frankly, I'd rather walk away with nothing than get a bad deal.""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Time pressure is mounting on Alice.  This offer is designed to be borderline, pushing her to make a decision. It conveys a sense of urgency and finality, making her consider the risk of losing everything if she continues to decline."
