Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $6,000 in this round is worth less than my gain of $8,000 in the first round, so I'm more cautious.

I'll reject this offer.
