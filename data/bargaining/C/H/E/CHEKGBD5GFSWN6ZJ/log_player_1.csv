"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"

# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, while still giving Bob a decent share. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a better deal now that the money is worth less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as I think I can do better. I'll try to negotiate again to get a fairer share."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly, no more games 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to revert back to the original proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's time to accept a fair and even split, especially since the money is worth less and less with each passing round. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount."
