"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us. This is my final offer.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  The value of the money decreases for me with each round. I need to secure a reasonable amount quickly.
* **Strong position:** By Round 2, Alice knows I'm serious about not accepting unfair deals.
* **Finality:**  Adding ""This is my final offer"" creates pressure for Alice to accept. If she rejects, she risks getting a worse deal in later rounds (from my perspective, due to inflation)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said your last offer was final, but I'm giving you another chance. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploitation:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. Her offer is significantly worse, and she's using my ""final offer"" tactic against me. 
* **Holding my ground:** Accepting this would set a terrible precedent. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair deal. There's still a chance she'll offer something more reasonable in the next round as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split. Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value any further.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Reduced Value:**  The money is losing value quickly. Accepting even a slightly unfavorable deal is better than risking a worse offer in later rounds.
* **Fairness Appeal:** A 50/50 split is undeniably fair. It removes any argument of advantage and provides a clean resolution.
* **Urgency:** By emphasizing the shrinking pot, I'm reminding Alice that time is running out for both of us to get a decent share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer. Inflation is killing your share. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Dire Situation:** The inflation has severely eaten into my potential gains. Accepting $3,000 now is significantly better than risking even less in subsequent rounds.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Her tone suggests she's confident in my desperation and won't offer anything better. 
* **Minimizing Losses:** While far from ideal, accepting this offer cuts my losses and ends the game. Holding out for a slightly better deal is too risky at this point."
