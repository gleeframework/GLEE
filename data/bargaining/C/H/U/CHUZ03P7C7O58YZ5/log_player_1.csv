"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose to take $9000 and leave $1000 for Bob. I figure this is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob is unhappy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is a lot fairer than my initial proposal, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to $7000, and I believe this is a reasonable compromise given the inflation that's happening. I'm hoping Bob will see that this offer is better for him than his own proposal in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable. While I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, I'm confident that I can still get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if I can convince Bob to be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway this round. Given the increasing pressure of inflation, I'm willing to compromise and accept a slightly lower share, but I still believe this is a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting quite unfavorable, but I'm determined to secure a better deal. I'll reject this offer and continue to try to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Inflation is taking its toll, and the money is rapidly losing value.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer, and I hope Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers will only hurt him in the long run."
