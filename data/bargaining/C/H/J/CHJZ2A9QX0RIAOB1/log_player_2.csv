Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a little more, but I'm not going to 50/50 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that the value of the money decreases for me over time, while it remains constant for her.  Even though she's slightly increasing her offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to hold firm and show her I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I need a larger share to account for the decreasing value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, take this deal before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is turning up the pressure, but her offer is still unacceptable.  She's clearly banking on me panicking as the rounds dwindle and the inflation eats into my potential gains. However, accepting a deal heavily in her favor is a worse outcome than walking away with nothing. I need to show her I'm serious about a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  A 50/50 split is the only fair solution.  Let's not throw away all the money.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to stand firm on the principle of fairness.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything significantly better at this stage, and the risk of losing everything is increasing rapidly with each round. A 50/50 split, while not ideal given the inflation, is the most rational choice in this situation."
