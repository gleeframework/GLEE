"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best approach, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."

# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the drastic shift in the proposed split, and Bob's message is a bit too aggressive for my taste. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the further reduction in the value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you more, but not that much more. Let's find a middle ground""}

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting $4,200 and Bob getting $5,800."

# Bob's message: You're getting low, I'm getting high! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with the proposed split, and Bob's message is quite gloating. At this point, I think it's clear that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get as much as possible. I'd like to propose one final offer that takes into account the extreme reduction in the value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my final offer:
