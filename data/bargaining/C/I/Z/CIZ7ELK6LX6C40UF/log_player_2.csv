Let's see how the game unfolds.  This offer is tempting, but I think we can do better if I hold out. I'll make my own proposal in the next round."

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was quite generous. This is a slightly more modest proposal. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While her offer is tempting, it's still not as good as my previous offer, considering the inflation we are both facing. I'm confident we can find a split that works better for both of us."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to increase my share slightly, but we need to reach an agreement soon before the inflation makes things even tougher.  Let's work towards a solution that's fair to both of us.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, but I still think we can find a better compromise than your last offer. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough call, and while I'd prefer my previous offer, the inflation is starting to hurt.  It's time to cut our losses and take what we can get."
