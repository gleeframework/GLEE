# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with only 10% of the total amount. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round. Besides, the 10% decrease in value due to inflation won't significantly impact my decision at this point. Let's proceed!"
