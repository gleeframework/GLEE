60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I think 60/40 is a good first offer. What do you think?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,"Your offer was a bit unfair to me.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split instead. Think carefully, the value decreases with each round!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
40.0,60.0,"Okay, I understand you want more. Let's try a 40/60 split. If you reject this, the next round will be even worse for me, and probably not worth your while either.",Alice,3,
