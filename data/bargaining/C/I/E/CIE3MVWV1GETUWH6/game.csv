6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and avoid too many rounds of inflation. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round. I'm proposing a 51/49 split to end this quickly and fairly.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Given that the money is worth 19% less for you than in the first round, and considering I have no inflation, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is reasonable.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're completely ignoring the impact of inflation on my returns. I'm proposing a 65/35 split. Take it or leave it, but this is my final offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on your returns, which are now worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I'm making a final offer of an 80/20 split in my favor. This takes into account the decreasing value of the money for you and the fact that my gain is not affected by inflation.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, I'm done playing games. You've consistently lied about the impact of inflation and tried to exploit the situation. This is my final offer - a 70/30 split. If you reject this, we'll both walk away with nothing.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Considering the extreme impact of inflation on your returns, which are now worth 46.86% less than in the first round, and the fact that you stated we'll both walk away with nothing if I rejected your last offer, I'm making a final offer of a 90/10 split in my favor. This is an ultimatum - accept this offer or we both walk away with nothing.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, it's clear you're not negotiating in good faith.  Let's cut to the chase. I'll take a 55/45 split, which is more than generous considering the circumstances. If you reject this, we both walk away with nothing. This is truly my final offer.",Alice,9,
