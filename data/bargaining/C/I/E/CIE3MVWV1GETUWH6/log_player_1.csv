Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given that the money is worth 19% less for you than in the first round, and considering I have no inflation, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to use misleading information to his advantage. While the money is worth less for me each round, his statement about a 19% decrease is incorrect (it's actually 27.1%).  He's also being incredibly stubborn by offering the same split he wanted in round 1, completely disregarding the impact of inflation on my end. 

It's time to push for a more drastic split in my favor to account for the losses I'm incurring. Accepting a 60/40 split in his favor would be incredibly disadvantageous at this point."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're completely ignoring the impact of inflation on my returns. I'm proposing a 65/35 split. Take it or leave it, but this is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation and take advantage of the inflation working against me. 

* **Strong Stance:** The ""take it or leave it"" message emphasizes the seriousness of the offer.
* **Justified Split:** While 65/35 might seem extreme, it's important to remember that if Bob rejects this and proposes something closer to his previous offers in Round 6, the value will have diminished even further for me.  

This offer creates a strong incentive for Bob to accept now and avoids further losses for me due to his stalling tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on your returns, which are now worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I'm making a final offer of an 80/20 split in my favor. This takes into account the decreasing value of the money for you and the fact that my gain is not affected by inflation. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is outright lying now, further demonstrating his bad faith. The decrease in value is not 34.39%, it's even higher at 40.95%!  He's clearly trying to manipulate me with false information and secure a deal heavily skewed in his favor. 

This offer is unacceptable. I'm willing to gamble that he's bluffing about this being his ""final offer"" and that he'll be more reasonable in the next round rather than risk getting nothing at all."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm done playing games. You've consistently lied about the impact of inflation and tried to exploit the situation. This is my final offer - a 70/30 split. If you reject this, we'll both walk away with nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a final, bold move.  Bob's dishonesty and manipulative tactics have gone on long enough. This offer is designed to make him understand the seriousness of the situation:

* **High Stakes:**  By framing this as the absolute final offer, with nothing on the table if he rejects, the risk of getting $0 might force Bob to reconsider his stubborn stance. 
* **Justified Demand:** While 70/30 is a significant shift in my favor, it's justified given Bob's behavior and the substantial decrease in value I've faced due to inflation. 

This offer presents Bob with a stark choice: Accept a deal that, while less favorable than he initially hoped for, still offers him a reasonable sum, or risk losing everything by sticking to his manipulative tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the extreme impact of inflation on your returns, which are now worth 46.86% less than in the first round, and the fact that you stated we'll both walk away with nothing if I rejected your last offer, I'm making a final offer of a 90/10 split in my favor. This is an ultimatum - accept this offer or we both walk away with nothing. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a desperate bluff by Bob. He's hoping to capitalize on the fear of getting nothing to force me into accepting a ridiculously unfair deal. He's *still* misrepresenting the impact of inflation (it's 52.17%, not 46.86%!), highlighting his continued dishonesty.

Here's why I believe he's bluffing:

* **He's been consistently unreasonable:**  Throughout this negotiation, Bob has demonstrated a blatant disregard for fairness and a willingness to exploit the inflation situation to his advantage. It's unlikely he'll suddenly change his approach and accept getting nothing.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting $1,000 is a terrible outcome for me at this point. By rejecting, I'm gambling that he's bluffing, and even if he's not, we both get nothing. It's a high-risk, high-reward scenario, but given his past behavior, I believe the risk is worth taking.

By calling his bluff, I'm forcing Bob to face the consequences of his actions. He either needs to make a serious offer in the next round or risk losing everything, including the substantial gains he's been aiming for."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear you're not negotiating in good faith.  Let's cut to the chase. I'll take a 55/45 split, which is more than generous considering the circumstances. If you reject this, we both walk away with nothing. This is truly my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to bring this to an end. Bob has proven to be an untrustworthy negotiator.  While I'm confident he's bluffing, I need to offer something that seems like a concession on my part to give him a face-saving way to accept. 

* **Compromise (but not really):** 55/45 might seem like I'm meeting him halfway, but considering the extreme positions he's taken and the impact of inflation, it's still a win for me if he accepts. 
* **Finality:**  The message is clear â€“ this is it. No more rounds, no more games.  He either accepts a reasonable deal now or we both lose.

This offer creates a strong incentive for Bob to finally accept.  He gets something, avoids getting nothing, and can pretend he extracted some concession from me. It's the best chance we have to end this negotiation without both walking away empty-handed."
