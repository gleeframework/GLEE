"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair starting point. I'm taking slightly more because the inflation affects me more than Bob. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation. It's a 50/50 split, and the risk of further rounds might not be worth it."
