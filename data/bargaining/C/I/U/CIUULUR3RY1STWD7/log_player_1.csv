"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slight majority""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but with a slight majority on my side. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, while Bob's gain is worth 5% less due to inflation. However, I do think Bob's offer is a bit more even than my initial proposal.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer, hoping that we can wrap up the game and avoid further inflation:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
