"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less to see if you'll accept!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, with a message to see if he'll accept a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take more now! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I don't like Bob's offer, as he's taking a much larger share of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less in this round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking more, but I'm still not giving up too much. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of the money, it's my turn to be generous... not! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With my share being worth 48.8% less than the original, I'll have to be very careful.

However, Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, and I don't think it's a good idea to accept. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gain, I'll have to be even more cautious. I'll aim to get a slightly larger share, but not too large, as I don't want to risk Bob rejecting again.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a smaller share, but I'm not giving up yet. Meet me in the middle!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking most of it now! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. With my share being worth 67.23% less than the original, I'm getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation.

However, I still have some hope that Bob might be willing to meet me in the middle. Accepting this offer would mean I'd get a very small share, but it's better than nothing.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm running out of options, and my potential gain is dwindling rapidly due to inflation. I'll make one last attempt to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 150000,
  ""bob_gain"": 850000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm taking a small share, but I'm not giving up. Meet me here or walk away with the majority.""
