"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still holding out for more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, which means he's getting a better deal than he would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
