"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be fair"". This is a reasonable starting point, as I'm giving Bob a significant share while also taking into account that the money is worth less to him with each passing round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should adjust the split in my favor this time, since the value decreases for me each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because a 40-60 split in his favor is not acceptable to me, especially since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round. I'll make a new proposal in the next round to try to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with the message ""Meet me in the middle"". This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's previous offer, taking into account that the money is still worth the same to me but less to Bob with each passing round. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair middle ground and accept the offer."
