"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $5,500 and give Bob $4,500. This is a fair starting point, giving me a slight advantage, but leaving room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it still feels unfair. The inflation hit me hard and taking only $4000 is not a good deal for me. I will try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair solution considering the inflation that has occurred and the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer. I believe this is a good compromise and will lead to a successful conclusion of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. Bob's offer is now very unfair, and I am not willing to accept so little for my share. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm proposing a slight shift in favor of Bob.  Since he's been pushing for a larger share, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  However, I'm holding firm at $4500.  I believe this is a fair compromise given the inflation and the back and forth of the game."
