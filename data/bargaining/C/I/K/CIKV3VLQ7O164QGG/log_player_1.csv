  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Start with a generous offer, let's see if you accept!""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a 20% share of the total amount. Let's see if he accepts!"

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 40%. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad compromise, but I think I can do better than that. I'd like to see a bit more equity in the deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a fair split!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a 30% share of the total amount. Let's see if he's willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure why you're being so stubborn, but I'm willing to meet you at 50/50 for now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to drive a hard bargain. A 50/50 split is a good offer, but I'm not sure I want to give up that much control. However, I also don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting nothing. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
