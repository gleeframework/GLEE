"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to get us going.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a decent starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll consider the effective amount I'll get from the offer.

Since the offer is an even split, I'll get $5000, which is 80% of the original $5000, due to the 20% inflation.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
