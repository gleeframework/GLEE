Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 95/5 is too far off for me. Let's try a 60/40 split. This recognizes your position while still giving me a decent share. We have a lot of rounds left, so we can adjust further as needed. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
