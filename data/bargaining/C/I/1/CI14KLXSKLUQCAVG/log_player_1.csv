"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping for a better deal considering the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more reasonable offer considering the effects of inflation."
