"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering worth drop""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $400,000 and took $600,000 for myself, considering that with each passing round, the money's value decreases more significantly for me than for Bob. I included a message to emphasize the fairness of the split given the conditions. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I need a bit more than that.  This offer considers the future value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer because, despite the decrease in value due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, considering the initial split I proposed was more in my favor and the fact that the money's value decreases more for me than for Bob with each round.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! Here's my next offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fairer split""}\n\nI've adjusted my offer slightly, taking into account the inflation but still aiming for a favorable split, emphasizing the fairness considering the different rates at which the money's value drops for us.\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fairer split""}\n\nI've adjusted my offer slightly from the first round, taking into account the inflation but still aiming for a favorable split, emphasizing the fairness considering the different rates at which the money's value drops for us. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant decrease in value for me (48.8% less than the original) and considering Bob's message that this is his final offer, I've decided to accept. Further rounds would only decrease the value even more drastically for me compared to Bob, making this the most reasonable choice to minimize losses."
