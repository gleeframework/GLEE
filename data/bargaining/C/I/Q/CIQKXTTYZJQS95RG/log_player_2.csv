{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was reasonable considering the situation. However, I'm confident we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about a 52/48 split in my favor?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but a 52/48 split still feels unfair given the inflation factor. Let's meet in the middle at 50/50. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both benefit from ending this game. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
