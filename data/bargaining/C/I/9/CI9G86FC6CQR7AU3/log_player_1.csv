I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a small share.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take what I can get now.  The inflation will keep eating away at the value of the money, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
