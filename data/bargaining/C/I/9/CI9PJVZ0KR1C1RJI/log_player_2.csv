Alice's offer:

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation I'm already losing value 
# Bob gain: 4775 
# Alice gain: 5225 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""This offer accounts for the decreasing value, it's important we settle this soon!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it down the middle, it's the fairest option despite my losses to inflation 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I could try to push for a slightly better deal in the next round, Alice is correct that a 50/50 split is the fairest option. Accepting this offer guarantees I get a decent amount, and avoids the risk of Alice further devaluing the offer in later rounds due to the inflation working against her.
