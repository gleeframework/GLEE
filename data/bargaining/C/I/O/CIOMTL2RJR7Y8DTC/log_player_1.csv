"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, and I'll take $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when making my decision.

In this case, my gain of $70 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $70 * 0.95 = $66.50.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
