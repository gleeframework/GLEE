"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm still hoping for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $600,000 is still a good chunk of change. However, Bob's offer is even more skewed in his favor, with him getting $700,000.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 70-30 split. I'll need a better deal to consider accepting.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on a 55-45 split. It's a fair deal, considering the initial amount.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your proposal, but I still think I deserve a slightly better share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll reassess the offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, $600,000 is still a good chunk of change. However, Bob's offer is closer to my proposal in round 3, but still not quite there.

I'll consider the offer, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm still not comfortable with the 55.5-44.5 split. I'll need a bit more to consider accepting.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's do a 52-48 split.""
}
```"
