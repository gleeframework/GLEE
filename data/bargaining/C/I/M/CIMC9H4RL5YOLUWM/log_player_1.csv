"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid going into further rounds and risking the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the slight decrease in value of the money. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob this time, hoping he'll accept it before the value of the money continues to decrease."
