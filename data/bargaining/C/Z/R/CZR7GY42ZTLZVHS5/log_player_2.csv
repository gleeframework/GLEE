It is always in my best interest to reject this offer as the game progresses, the money is worth less to Alice than it is to me. Since I am getting the lower share, I should try to get more by rejecting the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, slightly more for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Even though Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous one, my money is worth less, and I still have the opportunity to make a counter-offer.  Therefore, rejecting and trying to negotiate a better deal is the better choice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting impatient, take it or leave it 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

The money is worth significantly less now, and it's likely Alice will not budge on her offer.  Accepting is the best option as the next round will result in a much smaller share for me."
