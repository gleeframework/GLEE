"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how Alice reacts to a counter-proposal. While her offer seems generous considering the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts pressure on me, but your initial offer was too low. This is a more reasonable split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be higher. This is my revised offer 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is definitely using the inflation to her advantage, but her offer is still not generous enough. I need to hold out for a better deal while being mindful of the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. The inflation is hurting me, but dragging this out will only hurt us both. I propose a 50/50 split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're feeling the pressure of inflation, I'm not. My share should reflect that 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is getting dangerous. Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation situation, and my position is weakening with every round. While not ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing in the end."
