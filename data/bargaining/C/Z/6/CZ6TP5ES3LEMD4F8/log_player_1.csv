"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution. I'll keep an eye on inflation and adjust accordingly in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a more favorable split, this offer is still better than the potential outcome of future rounds considering the impact of inflation on my gains."
