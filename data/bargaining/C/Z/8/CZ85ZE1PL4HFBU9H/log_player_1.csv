"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amount I'd get in Round 2 is $4,000 (20% less than $5,000).

I'll decide to reject this offer since it's not significantly different from my initial proposal, and I'm hoping for a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 40% less than the original $10,000. Since I'm hoping to get a better deal, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amount I'd get in Round 4 is $2,400 (48.8% less than $4,600, which is 40% of the original $10,000). 

This offer is quite unfavorable for me, and I'm starting to think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll decide to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is worth 68.8% less than the original $10,000 now. Considering the drastic reduction in value, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amount I'd get in Round 6 is $1,000 (67.23% less than $3,000, which is 30% of the original $10,000). This is a very unfavorable offer for me, and I'm starting to think I should just accept it.
