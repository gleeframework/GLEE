"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still keeping a bit more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 4:6 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to maintain a decent amount for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings! I need to think carefully about this new offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although I'm getting a bit more than before, the inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and I'm not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."

# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'll give you a bit more to try to get this done. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on the value of the money! I need to think carefully about this new offer from Bob.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my guns, 40/60 is a fair split, let's end this.""
}
```

I'm going back to a 40/60 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
