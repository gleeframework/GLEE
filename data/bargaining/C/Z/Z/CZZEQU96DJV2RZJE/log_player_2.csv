Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I'm not. 50/50 is not an option 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation and knows time pressure is working against me. However, accepting an offer below 50/50 with this few rounds remaining is a bad strategy. I need to show I'm willing to risk it all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous. You're not getting the 60/40 split. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**  The goal now is to signal a hard limit but still leave a small window for negotiation. Accepting anything less than 48% at this stage would be disastrous due to the inflation. This offer attempts to show seriousness while still allowing for a deal to be made."
