Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle of our last offers. This is a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to frame her offer as generous, time is working against Bob much faster. Even though this offer is closer to a potential agreement point, accepting now would mean losing a significant portion of the initial value. It's worth risking another round to aim for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting me more.  This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:**  At round 6, the pressure is mounting. Bob needs to make a move that signals urgency while still aiming for a reasonable share.
* **Shifting Power Dynamic:** By stating this is his final offer, Bob introduces a hard deadline. This can nudge Alice to accept, knowing further delays only hurt both of them, though Bob disproportionately. 
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 4800 is a small increase for Alice from his previous offer, making it appear like a potential concession.

This strategy is a calculated gamble, but the shrinking pot means Bob needs to act decisively."
