"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. This is a risky strategy, as it leaves me with less money, but it might incentivize him to accept and end the game quickly. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, even after accounting for inflation. I'll reject and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to increase my share a bit. After Bob's rejection, it's clear that he wants a larger share. But I'm still willing to give him a fair amount to get a deal done. If he rejects again, I'll have to be more aggressive in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is worse for me than my offer in the previous round, the inflation is making my position much weaker. With each passing round, the value of the money I get decreases significantly. I'm taking a loss, but it's better than continuing to play and risk getting an even worse offer later."
