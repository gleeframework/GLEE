"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share this round, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with the 70-30 split, especially since I'm already getting less value due to inflation. I'd like to aim for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split given the inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a slightly more favorable split for me given the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not satisfied with the 65-35 split, especially considering the increased inflation. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more equal division of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in this proposal and accept it."
