"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, my friend!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to split it a bit more in my favor this time, since we're dealing with inflation.  Fair is fair, though, so I'm still offering you a good chunk! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,500 is now worth 20% less than my original proposal, which is $4,500 * 0.8 = $3,600. And Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 10% less than his original proposal, which is $5,500 * 0.9 = $4,950.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting $4,950, considering my gain is worth less. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,500 in the previous round is worth $3,600. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share to ensure we can finish the game soon!""
}
```"
