I'm going to propose keeping 9000 dollars for myself and giving Bob 1000 dollars. This way, I maximize my potential gain while still giving Bob a small amount to potentially incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer a bit, but still keep a larger share.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I want to avoid further losses."
