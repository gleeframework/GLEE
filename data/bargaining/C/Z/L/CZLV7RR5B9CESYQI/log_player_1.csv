"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, and Bob's offer is 30, that's equivalent to 33.33 in the first round. And Bob's gain of 70 is equivalent to 73.33 in the first round.

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself this time. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
