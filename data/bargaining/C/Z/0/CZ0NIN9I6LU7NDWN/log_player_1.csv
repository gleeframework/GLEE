"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the bigger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% reduction in my gains due to inflation, and Bob's proposal is quite lopsided. However, I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds and potential further inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
