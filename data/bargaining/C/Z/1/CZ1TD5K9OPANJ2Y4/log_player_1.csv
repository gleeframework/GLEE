"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but leaves some for Bob, hopefully incentivizing him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal that my share is reduced, it's better than getting nothing. I'm also unsure how inflation affects Bob, so accepting now might be the safest option."
