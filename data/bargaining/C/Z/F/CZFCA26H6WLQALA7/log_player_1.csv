"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to compromise and give you a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering you $300,000, which is a generous 30% of the total amount. Now it's your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, let's split it down the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's my turn now.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd rather get a higher share now to compensate for the loss in value. Splitting it down the middle is a reasonable offer, but I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make my own offer for Round 3."

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not going to give away too much.""

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze more out of me.

Considering the money I gain is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I'd rather get a higher share now to compensate for the loss in value. However, I don't want to give up too much, as the difference in value between our shares will continue to grow with each round.
