"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a relatively fair offer, considering I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"" is a lighthearted way of acknowledging that I'm taking a slightly larger share, while also emphasizing the importance of fairness in our negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both be happy with a slightly more even split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the split is more even, I still think I can get a better deal, especially considering the relatively small difference in our proposed shares. With the money being worth 10% less in this round, I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a potentially better offer in the next round. My response is:\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI'll make a new offer that's slightly more favorable to Bob, while still giving me a larger share. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a 57-43 split in my favor. My message to Bob is: ""Let's find a middle ground."" This is an attempt to appear more conciliatory and willing to compromise, which might make Bob more inclined to accept my proposal.\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We're losing money with every round, and I think we both want to get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (27.1% less than the original amount), I think it's wise to accept the even split and secure the remaining value. The risk of waiting for a potentially better offer in the next round is too high, and I might end up with less than what I'm being offered now. My response is:\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
