"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you take 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to reject this offer.  While it seems tempting to get something now, the inflation means waiting could be more beneficial.  I'll see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's be reasonable and avoid further rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. Let's split it 70/30, and we can end this game. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While 70/30 is not ideal, the inflation is significantly affecting the value of the money. It's better to secure a gain now, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
