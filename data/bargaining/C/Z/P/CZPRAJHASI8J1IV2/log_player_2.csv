"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good starting point 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's too early to settle for a 40/60 split. Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share this time.  Let's see if you agree.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious factor. Accepting this offer secures me a decent amount, and waiting for another round might not yield a better result with the decreasing value."
