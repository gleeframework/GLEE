"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit biased towards him, but it's a slightly better offer than my initial one.

I'll decide to reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split in my favor, which is a bit more aggressive. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be more generous, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! My gain is now worth significantly less than the original $10,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's still a bit biased towards him, but it's a slightly more generous offer than before. I'll decide to reject it and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, my gain is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, so I'm taking a firmer stance. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try to find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my gain! With my gain being worth only 39.01% of the original $10,000, I need to be cautious.

However, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a relatively fair and even division. Considering the current state of the economy, I think this is a good opportunity to accept the offer and get a decent share of the remaining money.
