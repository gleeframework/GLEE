"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, my friend!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we're both starting from a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too low, but I don't want to give him an opportunity to make another offer and potentially leave me with even less.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. I'll aim to get a larger share of the money while still leaving Bob with a decent amount.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger slice of the pie!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $7,000 and leaving $3,000 for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting into the value of the money! With the money being worth 14.26% less than the initial $10,000, I need to be even more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a relatively fair split, especially since he's meeting me halfway. I'm not sure if I can do better, and the risk of rejecting this offer and ending up with even less is high.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
