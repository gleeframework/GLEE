"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can reassess later if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm open to negotiating further if Bob is not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point. Let's see if you can do better 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, hoping to get a better deal than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, considering the inflation. Let's see if you can accept this one 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation effect on both our gains, I'll reevaluate Bob's offer. Considering the reduced value of money, I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 4000$ and consider this a fair deal given the circumstances."
