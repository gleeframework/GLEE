I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This leaves a good amount for Bob while still giving me a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've reduced my proposed take to 80% to show I'm willing to compromise.  This gives Bob a more reasonable share, and with inflation, we both need to be more realistic about our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a better split, inflation is hitting my share hard. This offer at least gives me some money.  It's better than nothing."
