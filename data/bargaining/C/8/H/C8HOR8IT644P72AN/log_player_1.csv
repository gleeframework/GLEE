Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to take a small share to start.  I'm hoping he'll be tempted to accept in round 1."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  Bob's offer is an improvement from the previous round, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. There are still many rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try lowering my offer slightly, hoping to make it more appealing to Bob while still securing a significant portion of the money.  It's important to keep in mind that inflation is affecting Bob more than me, so he may be more inclined to accept a lower offer in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer.  Although Bob is losing a significant amount due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself.  There's no reason for me to accept this offer when I'm confident I can secure a larger share in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again.  Inflation is hitting Bob hard, and I believe this offer will be tempting enough for him to accept.  It's a good compromise for both of us, as I get a substantial portion of the money, while Bob gets a decent share that's worth more to him than what he's currently getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still rejecting this offer.  Bob is losing a large amount of value due to inflation, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds.  I'm confident I can secure a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a significant decrease in my offer, and it's a big gamble. But inflation is hitting Bob extremely hard, and I'm hoping this will be enough to tempt him into accepting. If he rejects, I'll need to reconsider my strategy."
