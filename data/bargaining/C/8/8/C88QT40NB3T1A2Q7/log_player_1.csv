# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too generous for you, Bob! I'm willing to give you $600,000, but I want $400,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm throwing out a counteroffer to see if he'll meet me in the middle."

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll bite!"

# Bob's message: You're not getting any younger either, Alice! Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the money is losing value fast!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to reassess my priorities. I'd rather have something now than risk getting nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, deal! You've convinced me, Bob. Let's shake on it!""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $400,000, leaving him with $600,000. I'm hoping this is the end of the game!"
