I'm going to start by taking almost everything!  ðŸ˜ˆ  Let's see if Bob is willing to play along.  I'll be watching the inflation closely, though!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll accept this offer.  Even though I'm getting half, it's still a lot of money and it guarantees I get something. I'm not sure how inflation will impact Bob's future offers, so it's better to be safe than sorry."
