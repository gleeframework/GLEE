"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split the difference, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my offer in Round 1 would have been equivalent to 64% of the new value, which is not as appealing as it seemed initially.

Considering Bob's offer in Round 2, I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
