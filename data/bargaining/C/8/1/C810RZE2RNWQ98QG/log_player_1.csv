"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and take $550,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's split fairly"". Since it's the first round, there's no inflation to consider yet. This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's not so skewed that Bob would likely reject it outright. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable starting point and either accept it or make a counteroffer that we can work with.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's message suggests a willingness to collaborate, the actual offer is simply a reversal of my initial proposal, with Bob now taking the larger share. Considering the inflation, accepting this offer would mean I'd get $360,000 in first-round value (450,000 * 0.8), which is significantly less than my initial proposal. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal or see if Bob is willing to compromise further.\n\nYour turn! What's Bob's next move?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle?""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to propose an even split of the $1,000,000, with both of us getting $500,000. Considering the effects of inflation, my share would be worth $400,000 in first-round value (500,000 * 0.8), and Bob's share would be worth $450,000 in first-round value (500,000 * 0.9). My message, ""Meet in the middle?"", indicates my willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or make a counteroffer.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
