"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair and balanced start""}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. This is a fair and balanced starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair and balanced start, but I can do better 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. While it's a 50-50 split, I was initially hoping to get a bit more. But since Bob's offer is a fair one, I'll accept it.
