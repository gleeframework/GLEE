Let's see if Bob will agree to a 90-10 split.  I'm aiming for a good starting point, but I'm ready to negotiate if necessary!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept a 10-90 split, especially since the money is losing value with each round. I'll counter with a more fair proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split.  This is still a good deal for me considering the inflation, and it's a fairer offer than Bob's last proposal. Hopefully, he'll see that this is a good way to end the game."
