"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This way, we can both agree on a fair share.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering you're getting a 5% discount on the money with every round. This ensures we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
