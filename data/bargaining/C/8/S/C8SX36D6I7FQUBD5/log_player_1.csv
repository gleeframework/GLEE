"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to make a big splash!

I'll think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 20% less, $300,000 is equivalent to $240,000 in the original amount, and $700,000 is equivalent to $560,000.

I'm not sure I want to give up so much, but I'm not sure if I can do better either. Let's see...
