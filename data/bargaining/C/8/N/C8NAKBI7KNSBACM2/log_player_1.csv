Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $1, and take the rest for myself. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each round, it's better to get as much as possible now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. The value of the money I get is decreasing each round, so it's wiser to take a 50/50 split now rather than risk getting less in the future."
