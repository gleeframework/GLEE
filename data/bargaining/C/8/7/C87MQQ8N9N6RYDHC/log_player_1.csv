Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by being generous. I want to see if Bob is interested in a quick and easy split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair, and the risk of further inflation means I could end up with less if I reject."
