"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a more balanced split.  Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the 55-45 split, but I don't want to risk going to another round with the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
