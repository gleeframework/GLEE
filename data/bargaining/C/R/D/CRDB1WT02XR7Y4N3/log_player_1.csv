"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30$ and keeping 70$ for myself. This is a fair starting point, and I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less for Bob, but the same for me.

I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle, as I was hoping to get a bit more. However, this is a reasonable offer, and it's a good opportunity to make some progress.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
