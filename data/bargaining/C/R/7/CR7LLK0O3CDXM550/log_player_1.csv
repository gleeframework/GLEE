I reject this offer.  While I'm losing value with each round, Bob isn't, so he's likely to keep offering me less and less. I need to try to get a better deal in the next round."

This is a very bad offer considering the inflation rate. I will keep rejecting until Bob offers a more reasonable division."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This is a terrible deal, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.  But, I'm not going to give in yet. I have to keep trying to get a better deal.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that I'm not going to settle for this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering an even split.  The inflation is really hurting me now, and I'm running out of time.  I need to find a solution that will get us both some money, even if it means accepting less than I initially wanted."
