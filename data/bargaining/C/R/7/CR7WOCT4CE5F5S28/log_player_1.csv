"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll get the remaining $8,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the game is just beginning and we have plenty of time to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual value he's offering to be 3000 / 0.8 = 3750.

In this case, I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
