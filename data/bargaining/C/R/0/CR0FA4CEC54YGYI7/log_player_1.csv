"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this first offer, as the inflation might make this offer less attractive in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my initial proposal, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is still beneficial after the inflation.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half of the remaining value."
