"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share this round, but I think I deserve more for taking on the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I need to adjust my calculation. Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice gain: 3000 / 0.8 = 3750 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob gain: 7000 / 0.95 = 7368 (due to 5% inflation)

I'm not thrilled about the 3000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept the offer.
