Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small portion of the money (100,000$) to see if he's willing to accept it early on. I'm aiming for a larger share, and I'm hoping that Bob will be tempted by even a small amount, considering the time pressure and the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious factor.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me $500,000, which is still a significant sum.  It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
