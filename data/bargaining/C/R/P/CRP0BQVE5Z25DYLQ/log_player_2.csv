Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a slight advantage when making the offer. Let's be practical. I'm proposing a similar split to yours, just reversing the favor.  This way we avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100
