Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to start with a slight advantage for me since I'm making the offer this time. But, I'm willing to split things close to evenly, as we both benefit from a bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
