"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose a 990,000 / 10,000 split. Since I'm the one making the first offer, I'll take the majority.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than what I would get if we go to the next round, it's still not fair.  Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share.  This offer gives me 700,000, and Bob gets 300,000.  Let's see if he's willing to split it this way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is worse than what I had in round 2!  It's not worth accepting this, as I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. I'll keep negotiating."

Round 5

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
