"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 into $7,500 for me and $2,500 for you. This gives us both a fair share.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40, with me taking 6000 and you taking 4000. This is a fair compromise considering inflation will devalue the money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
