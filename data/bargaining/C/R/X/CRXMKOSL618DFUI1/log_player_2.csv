Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money with a slight advantage for me in the first round. This offer saves us both time and guarantees a good sum.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This is a much better deal for you than waiting. The clock is ticking â€“ and the money's shrinking!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable. I've lowered my ask, acknowledging the time pressure.  This offer still gives me a slight edge considering the faster inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her ask, it's crucial to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for her.  I need to push for a more significant advantage in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, the value is fading fast. This offer gives you a decent share considering the time pressure. Let's be practical and end this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day. It's a fair deal considering the inflation, and we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice is finally offering a 50/50 split.  Given the rapidly decreasing value of the money, especially for Alice, it's unlikely she'll offer anything better. Accepting now ensures we both walk away with a reasonable sum.  Delaying further significantly risks ending up with nothing."
