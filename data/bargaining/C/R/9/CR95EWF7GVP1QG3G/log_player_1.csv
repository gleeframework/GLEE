**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is significantly eating into Alice's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer of $4,000 is better than risking another round where she'd likely get even less.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the longer the game goes on, the worse it gets for Alice."
