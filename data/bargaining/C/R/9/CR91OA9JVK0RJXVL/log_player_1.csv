"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid further negotiations and the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more but we can still both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, but I'm still looking to maximize my gain.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 40% of the adjusted amount. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and let's end this, I'm getting anxious about inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, with me getting 55% of the adjusted amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game before the money loses too much value."
