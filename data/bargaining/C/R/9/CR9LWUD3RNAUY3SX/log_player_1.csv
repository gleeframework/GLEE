Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split. It's a fair compromise considering the initial amount.

# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
