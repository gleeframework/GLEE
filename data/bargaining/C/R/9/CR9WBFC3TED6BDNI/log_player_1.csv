"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 60-40 in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'll be the first to make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I was initially offered 40% and now I'm being offered 30%. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of negotiating.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit closer to the original 60-40 split, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the best I can do 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, as I was hoping for a better deal after rejecting his previous offers. Meeting halfway is still a bit too far from my original target of 60% for me. I'm willing to wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is the minimum I'm willing to accept.""
}
```

I'm trying to push the needle a bit further in my favor, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 50/50, but I think this is the best I can do 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Splitting it 50/50 seems like a fair compromise, and I'm not willing to push for a better deal at this point. It's better to end the game now than to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
