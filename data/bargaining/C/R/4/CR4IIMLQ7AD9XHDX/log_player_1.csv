"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a good idea to accept a 50/50 split, but I'd like to make a counteroffer to see if I can get a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I like the 50/50 idea, but can we consider 55/45 in my favor?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really starting to kick in now!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own share.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
