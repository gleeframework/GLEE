"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I know the value decreases faster for you, so I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Since the money is worth less to me with each passing round, I think this 55/45 split in my favor is a reasonable compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer. You're losing value quickly. Take this 43/57 split or risk getting even less next round. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take the 43/57 split. With the inflation, I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round."
