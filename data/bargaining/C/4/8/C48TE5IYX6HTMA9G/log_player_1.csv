"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is my initial offer. I'll take the vast majority of the money, leaving Bob with just $1. I figure this is a good starting point, as the inflation will quickly erode the value of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still a considerable amount of money, and with each round, the value of Bob's offer will diminish further due to inflation. Accepting is the best course of action."
