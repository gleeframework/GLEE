"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600, ""alice_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""I understand you want a fair deal. How about this slightly adjusted offer?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject it and counter with a more balanced proposal.
* **My Offer:** I'm proposing a slight shift in our favor, recognizing the time value of money due to inflation. This offer still allows Alice a reasonable share while giving us a slight advantage. 
* **Message:**  The message aims to be collaborative and understanding, not aggressive. We want Alice to be receptive to our offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to fair, but it still heavily favors her, even considering the inflation.  We need to hold firm to get a more equitable split.  We're running the risk of the money becoming almost worthless if this drags on too long."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""We need to reach a deal soon. This offer acknowledges the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable share.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. We need to push for a resolution quickly.
* **Balanced Offer:** This offer is a strong move towards a compromise. It's not ideal, but it's better than letting the negotiations drag on and the money losing even more value. 
* **Direct Message:** The message is more direct now, highlighting the urgency of the situation and encouraging Alice to accept a reasonable deal."
