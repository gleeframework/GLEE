"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $1, but you'll have to negotiate hard to get more!""
}
```

This offer is essentially a take-it-or-leave-it proposal, but I'm leaving a tiny bit for Bob to try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start.  
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be fair!

I'll have to think about it... Considering the inflation, the $500,000 I'd gain in this round is actually worth more than the $1 I could have had in the first round, but still less than the $999,999 I could have had.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get more in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, I'll try to be more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900,000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100,000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal for both of us.  
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's reasonable enough!

Considering the inflation, the $600,000 I'd gain in this round is actually worth more than the $900,000 I could have had in the previous round, but still less than the $999,999 I could have had.

I'll think about it... and decide to reject this offer, hoping to get more in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'll try to be even more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

  ""bob_gain"": 300,000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! Make a better offer or walk away!""

# Bob's message: We're getting close to the end. This is my final offer. Let's reach a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final push for a compromise. Considering the inflation, the $650,000 I'd gain in this round is actually worth more than the $700,000 I could have had in the previous round, but still less than the $999,999 I could have had.

I'll think about it... and decide to accept this offer, as it's getting close to the end and I don't want to risk getting nothing.
