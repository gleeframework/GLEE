I propose that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I'm aiming for a large portion since I'm the one making the first offer, but I'm also trying to be reasonable to hopefully avoid going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500} 
```

Since Bob rejected my offer and now I'm making the proposal again, I need to make it more appealing to him.  I'm lowering my share to $8,500 and raising Bob's to $1,500.  With inflation, the money I gain is worth less, so it's a bigger reduction for me than it is an increase for him."
