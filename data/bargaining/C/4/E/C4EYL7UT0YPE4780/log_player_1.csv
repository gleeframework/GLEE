{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."

# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this is a good offer for me. I'm losing more than I would have in the first round, and the money I'm gaining is worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500

I think this offer is reasonable, considering the inflation. I'm still losing some value, but it's a compromise that seems fair. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
