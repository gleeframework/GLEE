"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'm willing to give you 40%, but let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair starting point, I can likely get a better deal for myself by making a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable given the potential for inflation in future rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's call it even. I'm willing to split it down the middle to avoid further negotiation and the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I might be able to get a slightly better deal in future rounds, the risk of inflation is too high.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the safest option at this point."
