Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  I'm hoping he'll accept since it's a good starting point, and if he rejects, I'll get to adjust the offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have a larger share, I realize that if I reject this offer, the next round will result in a further loss due to inflation.  Accepting ensures I get at least $500,000, which is better than risking getting less in the next round."
