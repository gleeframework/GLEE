"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This is a risky move, but I want to try to secure the vast majority of the money right away. Since the inflation rate is unknown, I want to maximize my gain in the first round.  I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation rate is unknown and this offer is a significant improvement over the previous round. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial portion of the money, mitigating the risk of losing everything due to inflation."
