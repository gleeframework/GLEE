"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20 to start, and we can reassess if we go to further rounds.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly for now, we can adjust if needed later 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. Since Bob is proposing an even split, I'll decide to accept his offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
