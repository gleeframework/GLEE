"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45% share, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 50-50 is only fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
