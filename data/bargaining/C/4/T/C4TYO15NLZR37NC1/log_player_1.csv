"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going to try and get a large share in the first round, as the value of the money will decrease with each subsequent round. I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money,  the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least 40% of the value of the original $100. If I reject, I risk getting even less in the next round, and the money will be worth even less then."
