"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal Bob. I take $60, you take $40. It's better to secure a good deal now, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round. With inflation, Alice loses more value than me, so I might get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you lose more value each round. This way, we both get something.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and we're both losing! I'll take a little less than my original offer,  $55, and you get $45.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round. With inflation, Alice loses even more value than me, so I might get an even better deal later. Her offer is still not good enough for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""You're losing a lot of value each round. I think it's time for me to take the bigger share. This way, we can both walk away with something, but I get a bit more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it down the middle, 50/50, before we both lose even more money to this insane inflation. It's the fairest deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant loss of value due to inflation for both of us, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable and fair deal at this point. Further rounds would only lead to more loss for both of us, so it's time to accept this offer and walk away with something rather than risking further devaluation."
