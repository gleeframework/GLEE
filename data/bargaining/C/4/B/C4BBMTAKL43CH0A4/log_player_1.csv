"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly in half, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm curious to see if Bob will accept or reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get more, considering the initial amount was 10,000""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the original amount was $10,000. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, trying to find a balance between a fair split and getting a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll accept, it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk getting nothing""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, with the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'd rather take the $4,000 now than risk getting nothing if the game continues."
