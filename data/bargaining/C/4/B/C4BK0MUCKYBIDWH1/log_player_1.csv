"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in an 8:2 ratio. This allows us both to have a fair share while considering the decrease in value.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split. This is more equitable than your initial offer and ensures we both receive a substantial amount. I understand the decreasing value, but I believe this split best reflects our contributions. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
