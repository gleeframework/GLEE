"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but you'll have to take it 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $600,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'd get $540,000, and Bob's $400,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so he'd get $320,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'd get $300,000, which is less than the $540,000 I'd get in the previous round. However, it's still more than the $320,000 Bob would get if I accepted his offer in the previous round.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
