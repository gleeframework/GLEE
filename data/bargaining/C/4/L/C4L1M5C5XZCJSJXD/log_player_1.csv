Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me."

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer.
