"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""Let's divide the money in a 3:1 ratio. I believe it's fair considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential loss of value in future rounds. This gives you a comfortable share while allowing me to benefit from the decreasing value of money. Let's end this now and avoid the risk. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
