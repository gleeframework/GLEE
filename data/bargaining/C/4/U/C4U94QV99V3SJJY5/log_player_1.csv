Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it.  It's a good starting point, but I'm also keeping in mind that the money will be worth less in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting less than I wanted initially, the inflation is a factor, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's better to secure 80% now than gamble on a better offer in the future."
