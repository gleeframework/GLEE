"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll consider it a fair split, but I'd like to get a bit more. However, I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer and potentially losing out on the entire amount due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
