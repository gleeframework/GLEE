"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A compromise, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 800,000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
