"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

I'm proposing a 990,000 - 10,000 split. Since this is the first round, I'm taking a large share, but I'm leaving Bob with something to hopefully encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 700,000 - 300,000 split. I'm offering Bob a larger share than in Round 1, as I want to encourage him to accept this offer. Since I rejected his previous offer, I need to offer something more attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is smaller than what I proposed in the last round, my share is worth significantly less due to inflation. It's better to accept this offer and get something, rather than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
