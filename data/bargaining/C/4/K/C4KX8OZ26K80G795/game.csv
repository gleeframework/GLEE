4000.0,6000.0,"I know we're running out of time, but I'm not willing to give up yet. Considering the inflation, I think 60/40 is a fair deal now. Take it or we'll both lose.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Okay, Bob, I get it. You're a tough negotiator. I'll accept your previous offer of 60/40. Let's end this before we both lose out.",Alice,7,
