"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to get Bob to accept and avoid any potential for conflict in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
