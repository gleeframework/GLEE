I'm going to try to get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. Since I rejected her offer, I get to propose this time.  I think this is a fair split, given that we both have an equal chance of getting the better deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse, and the money is losing value. I need to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice an even split.  The money is losing value rapidly, and a 50/50 split is the most sensible way to ensure we both get something."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice $6,000 and keep $4,000 for myself. The inflation is hitting hard, and I need to secure a decent amount before it gets worse.  I'm hoping Alice will see the value in this offer, as the next round might leave us both with even less."
