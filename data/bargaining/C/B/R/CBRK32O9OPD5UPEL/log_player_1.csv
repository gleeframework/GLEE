Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n### I made an offer to divide the $100, where I'll receive $60 and Bob will receive $40.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a fair 50/50 split is the best way to go. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I decided to accept Bob's offer, as a 50/50 split seems like a fair and reasonable way to divide the $100. This ends the game, and we both receive $50."
