Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the 50/50 sentiment, but let's be strategic. This offer still gives you a significant sum, and the longer we wait, the less your share will be worth due to inflation. Time is money! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
