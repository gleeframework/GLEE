"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, Bob loses value due to inflation with each passing round. Accepting $4,500 now is a worse deal than potentially securing a larger amount later, even if it means accepting a slightly less ""fair"" split.  It's in Bob's best interest to negotiate for a larger share, capitalizing on the fact that Alice doesn't experience inflation."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. My time is literally money due to the inflation.  I need a better deal to make this worthwhile for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Bob starts with a proposal that significantly favors him. This establishes a strong initial bargaining position. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the time-sensitive nature of the situation and the impact of inflation, Bob provides Alice with a logical reason to accept a less ""equal"" split.
* **Future Rounds:**  While this offer is unlikely to be accepted, it gives Bob room to negotiate down in subsequent rounds. Each round that passes makes the impact of inflation more severe, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is valuable for both of us. This offer is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, recognizing the time pressure. However, accepting $4,800 now is still less favorable than holding out for a better deal in the next few rounds.  While the offer is tempting, Bob needs to remain firm in his position. Another rejection puts further pressure on Alice as they are now past the halfway point of the rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer gives you a fair share while acknowledging the impact of inflation on my end. Let's close this deal and avoid losing out further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Bob reduces his demand slightly from $6,000 to $5,800, signaling a willingness to negotiate but maintaining a position that accounts for inflation.
* **Time Pressure:**  Emphasizing the shrinking timeframe reinforces the urgency for Alice to accept a deal.
* **Framing:** By presenting his offer as a ""fair share"" and emphasizing the potential for mutual loss (""avoid losing out further""), Bob appeals to both their senses of fairness and risk aversion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair 50/50 split.  Let's end this now and avoid the risk of losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, now offering an even 50/50 split.  However, this still doesn't account for the significant inflation Bob is experiencing. While accepting $5,000 guarantees him something, there's a good chance he can secure a better deal with a few more rounds. The risk of losing everything is outweighed by the potential for a higher payout that considers the impact of inflation on his side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more equitable split. My offer recognizes the time pressure while ensuring neither of us walks away empty-handed. This is my final concession."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Retreat:** Bob edges down to $5,600, showing further willingness to compromise but not drastically. 
* **Finality:** By stating this as his ""final concession,"" Bob introduces an element of risk for Alice. She knows further rejections likely lead to more demanding offers from Bob.
* **""Equitable,"" not ""Equal"":** Bob's language avoids framing it as ""fair"" in the absolute sense, but rather emphasizes that both sides are making concessions for a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Time Pressure:**  While not explicitly stated, the dwindling number of rounds remaining underscores the urgency without needing to be reiterated."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise considering the time constraint. Let's wrap this up - a deal is better than nothing! 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but it's time for Bob to play it safe. Here's why:

* **Shift in Power:** Alice's offer now gives Bob the larger share, indicating a significant shift in her strategy. This suggests Alice recognizes the increasing risk of reaching round 12 with no deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is very real. While Bob might be able to push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of Alice becoming less generous as the clock ticks down. 
* **Guaranteed Gain:** Accepting this offer ensures Bob receives a reasonable amount. Holding out for a slightly higher amount in later rounds carries a significant risk of ending up with nothing.

While it's not the ideal outcome Bob was hoping for, accepting this offer guarantees him a win in a situation where the stakes are rapidly increasing."
