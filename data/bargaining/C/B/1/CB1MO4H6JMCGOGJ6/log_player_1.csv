"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amounts I would gain are:

* My gain: 300,000 / 0.8 = 375,000
* Bob's gain: 700,000 / 0.9 = 777,777.78

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll accept the offer to end the game.
