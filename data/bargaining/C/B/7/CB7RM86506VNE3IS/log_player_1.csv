I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'll be the one losing value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm proposing a split of 810,000 for me and 190,000 for Bob.  While my share is lower than in the first round, I'm still taking into account the inflation and trying to be reasonable."
