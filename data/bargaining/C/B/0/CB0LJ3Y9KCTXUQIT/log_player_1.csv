"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me getting 900,000 and Bob getting 100,000. This is a good starting point, and I think it gives Bob a fair chance while also securing a good amount for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000.  This is a more even split than my previous offer, but I still need to secure a good amount for myself, especially since inflation is impacting my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, a 50/50 split is the fairest offer I've received so far.  It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
