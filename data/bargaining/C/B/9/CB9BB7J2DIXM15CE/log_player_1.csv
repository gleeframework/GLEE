"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a fairly standard starting offer, with me getting a slight edge, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll on the value of my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully. Since Bob's offer is 50/50, it seems fair, but I'm not sure if I should take it or wait for a better offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation is affecting my potential gain, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed in my favor, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger toll on the value of my potential gain, and Bob's offer is now more favorable to him. I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is now 55/45, it's a good opportunity for me to get a better deal. I'll accept this offer.
