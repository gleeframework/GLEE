"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a generous 20% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for an even split, Alice. We both get a fair share, and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants an even split, eh? That's a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me.

I'll reject the offer for now and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was an even split, I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is still a significant amount, but I'm trying to get a bit more for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a larger share to avoid further inflation, but I need to ensure a decent return for myself as well. How about this split? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer! $400,000 is worth significantly less than $250,000 was in the first round.

However, I'm still not convinced that I'm getting the best deal. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Bob's offer was lower due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more to compensate for the inflation. Can you reconsider?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is still a decent amount, but I'm trying to get a slightly better share for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are nearing the end of the game. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to secure a reasonable amount to avoid losing most of it to inflation. Let's split the difference. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer now! $450,000 is worth a tiny fraction of what $250,000 was in the first round.

However, I'm getting a bit desperate, and I don't want to risk waiting for another offer that might be even worse. I'll accept this offer and take the $550,000.
