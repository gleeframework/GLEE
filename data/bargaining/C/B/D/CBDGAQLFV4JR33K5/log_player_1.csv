"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still leave you with a decent amount. This is my first and best offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 70% of the remaining money, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40% less now due to inflation, so I need to be strategic with my offer. I'll try to get a better deal before the money loses even more value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take the majority, but I'll still get a decent chunk.""
}
```"
