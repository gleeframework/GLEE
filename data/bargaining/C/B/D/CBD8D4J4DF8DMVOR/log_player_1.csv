"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'd like to adjust my proposal to account for that. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}"
