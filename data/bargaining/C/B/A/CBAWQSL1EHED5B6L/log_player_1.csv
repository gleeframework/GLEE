"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $600,000 for herself and give $400,000 to Bob. She also includes a message, ""Let's share fairly,"" to try to persuade Bob to accept the offer. The offer is slightly biased in Alice's favor, but she hopes Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise and accept it to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we both need to factor in. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to reject Bob's offer. She realizes that accepting this offer would give her $450,000, which is less than what she initially proposed for herself. Considering the inflation, Alice's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, but she still believes she can negotiate for a better deal. She is willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round, hoping to get a more favorable offer or make a counteroffer that Bob will accept."
