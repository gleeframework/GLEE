"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% of the money, let's start with a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's time for me to take a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, the numbers are:

Alice's gain: 100000 / 0.8 = 125000
Bob's gain: 900000

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 split, no more generosity!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You want 50/50, but I want 95%! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's being greedy! 

Let's calculate the actual values:

Alice's gain: 50000 / 0.528 (80% of original value) = 94615
Bob's gain: 950000

I'm not happy with this offer, but I'll think about it. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a big chunk, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 66.67-33.33 split, trying to balance the risk of giving Bob a bigger share with the need to protect my own interests."
