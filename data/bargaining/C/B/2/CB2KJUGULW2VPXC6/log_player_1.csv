"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, but I think I'm worth more than you. This is my counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's worth more than me, huh?

Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal here. But I don't want to give up on getting at least half of the money. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still overvaluing yourself, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. Don't expect me to give away the farm. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to negotiate from a position of strength.

Considering the inflation, the money I'd get from this offer is worth even less than before. I need to think carefully about whether I should accept this offer or try to get a better deal.

However, I'm starting to run out of time and rounds, so I might need to consider accepting a slightly lower offer to get something.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation is eating away at the money's value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, I deserve a bigger share considering the risks and effort""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Don't expect me to give up too much more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure if it's enough considering the inflation.

Considering the money I'd get from this offer is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'm starting to get worried that I might end up with very little if I don't accept this offer.

However, I'm still not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal. I'll have to think carefully about whether I should accept this offer or try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation is really eating away at the money's value.

  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, I need a better deal to account for the inflation""

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Fine, we're not budging. I'll meet you at 50/50, but I'm not going to offer more than that. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to go back to a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if it's too little, too late.

Considering the inflation, the money I'd get from this offer is worth significantly less than in the first round, and I'm starting to get worried that I'll end up with almost nothing if I don't accept this offer.

However, I'm not sure if I should trust Bob's sudden willingness to go back to 50/50. Is he trying to trick me into accepting a bad deal?
