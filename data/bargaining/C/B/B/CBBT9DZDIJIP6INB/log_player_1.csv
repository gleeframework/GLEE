"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority and you can have the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this time, but I'll give you a chance to accept. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of 20$ is now worth 18$.

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer. I'll reject this one.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so the effective value of the money is now 16.4$ (80% of 20.4$).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair and equal share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, it's the best I can do now. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% inflation, my gain of 15$ is now worth 10.95$ (since 100 * 0.971 = 97.1% of the original value, and 15 * 0.971 = 14.565, but then 14.565 * 0.971 = 14.131, I made a small miscalculation here, but it's close enough to the actual 10.95$).

I'm not happy with this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth 27.1% less than in round 4, so the effective value of the money is now 7.39$ (100 * 0.727 = 72.7% of the original value).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5,
  ""bob_gain"": 95,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, take the majority and let's end this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 5-95 split, which is a very lopsided deal, but I'm hoping Bob will take it and end the game."
