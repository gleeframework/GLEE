"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll consider the offer accordingly.

My current gain would be 300,000 * 0.8 = 240,000.

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer.
