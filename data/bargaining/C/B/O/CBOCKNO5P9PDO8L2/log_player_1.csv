Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement. I'm confident that even with inflation, this deal will be beneficial for both of us in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's clear that Bob is not willing to be as generous as I was. Accepting this offer guarantees me half of the money, which is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing at all."
