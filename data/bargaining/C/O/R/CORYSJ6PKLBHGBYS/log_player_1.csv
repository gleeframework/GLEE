"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob.  This gives me the best chance of ending the game quickly, as the inflation will hurt Bob more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to try and get more of the money. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob a lower amount than before, but still a significant share. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him than his previous offer, considering the continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and offering me a much smaller share. Even though the inflation is hitting me harder, I'm still going to reject and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than in the previous round, but still a significant portion less than his last offer.  With each round, the inflation is making Bob's share worth less, and I'm hoping he'll start to see that it's in his best interest to accept a deal before the value drops further."
