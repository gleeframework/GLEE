I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the deal in the first round. I'll see if he's willing to take a small piece of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take what I can get.  Bob's offer is still decent, and if I reject, he'll get more in the next round, and I'll get less.  It's time to secure the deal!"
