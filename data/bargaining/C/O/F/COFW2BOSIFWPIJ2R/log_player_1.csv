"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $6,000 from the first round is now worth $5,400 in the second round. I still have the option to accept Bob's offer, which is $5,000 for me. I'll take it.
