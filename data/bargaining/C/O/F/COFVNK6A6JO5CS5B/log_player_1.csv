"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000$ and give 1000$ to Bob. This seems fair as I am the one proposing, and we have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to acknowledge Bob's increasing leverage due to inflation. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, but I'm still holding onto a larger portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a tough one, but I still think I can get a better deal than 2000. Bob's leverage is increasing, but I haven't given up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still holding onto a significant portion of the money. I need to balance the risk of him rejecting this offer with the fact that inflation is working in his favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's leverage is increasing, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I think I can get more than 4000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. We are both losing a considerable amount of money due to inflation, so it's time to be realistic and compromise.  A 50/50 split is the most fair solution given the current circumstances."
