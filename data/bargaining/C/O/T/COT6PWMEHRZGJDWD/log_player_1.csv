Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split was fair, but we can do better. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? This accounts for the decreasing value of the money as we go forward. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
