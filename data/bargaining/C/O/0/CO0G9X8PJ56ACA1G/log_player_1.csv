 I'm going for a fairly aggressive first offer.  I'm hoping Bob will be tempted by the chance to get something even if it's a small amount. I want to establish myself as the dominant player early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is playing a dangerous game! He's taking a huge risk by offering me such a small amount.  I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to counter his offer in the next round.  He's probably feeling cocky, but I know I can turn the tables on him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm going for a more balanced offer this time. Bob's risk-taking in the last round shows that he's willing to gamble. I think a 50/50 split is fair given the volatility of the game, and it's a good chance for him to come to his senses before things get more extreme."
