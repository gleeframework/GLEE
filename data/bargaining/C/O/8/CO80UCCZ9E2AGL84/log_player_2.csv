"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. It's a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see if I can get a better deal.  The inflation factor could work in my favor if we keep going."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is fairer, considering I'll be making all the decisions in the next round if you reject this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise. Let's end the game here. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

A 50-50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk losing more due to inflation."
