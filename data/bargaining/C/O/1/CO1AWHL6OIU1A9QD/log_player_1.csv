{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."

# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a better starting point.  Let's see if we can agree on something fair! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I was hoping to get a better deal, considering the initial offer I made was 60/40. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:
