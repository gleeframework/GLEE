"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, hoping to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and simple solution 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000
Bob gain: 500000 * 0.8 = 400000

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less again, so the effective amount is 0.8^2 = 0.64 of the original amount.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer this time. Accept and we can move forward.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, taking a larger share, but still leaving some room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less in the first round, and another 20% less in the second round, and now another 20% less, so the effective amount is 0.8^3 = 0.512 of the original amount.

The actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 400000 * 0.512 = 204800
Bob gain: 600000 * 0.512 = 307200

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'm willing to consider it since the inflation is eating into the value of the money. I'll accept the offer.
