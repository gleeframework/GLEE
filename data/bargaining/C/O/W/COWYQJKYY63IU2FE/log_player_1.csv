"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering to split the money 50/50, so we both get $500,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still being worth the same, but Bob's gain being worth 5% less, I think I can do better than 40/60. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's gain is worth less each round. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount, in the hopes that he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to stick to his original 60/40 split. Considering the inflation has reduced the value of Bob's gain even further, I'll take this offer.
