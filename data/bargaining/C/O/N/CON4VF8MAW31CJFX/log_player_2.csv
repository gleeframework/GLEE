Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, time to get serious. I'll take a little less - $65 - but you need to agree now before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
