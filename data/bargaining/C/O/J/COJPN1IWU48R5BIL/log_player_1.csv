"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's end the game""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us receiving $500,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not getting as much as I would have in the first round. However, I'm not willing to give up too much.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""I'll take the deal, but can we discuss a slight adjustment?""}"
