"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite lopsided. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  This round is your last chance to get a decent sum before inflation significantly eats into your share. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
