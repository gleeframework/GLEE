"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will take it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Divide equally, let's work together for fairness! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to be fair, huh?

I'll have to think about this... If we divide the money equally, I'll get $500,000, which is a decent amount, but it's not the maximum I could get.

However, the message ""let's work together for fairness"" makes me wonder if Bob is trying to set a precedent for future rounds. If we do divide equally, it might make it harder for me to negotiate a better deal in future rounds.

I'll reject this offer for now and see what happens next.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has already taken a bite out of the money, and it's worth 20% less for me now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! Take this or walk away!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a smaller share than before, but still a decent amount. The message is a bit of a warning, trying to create a sense of urgency and pressure on Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a compromise, Alice. I'm willing to give you more if you're willing to give me a bit more too. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is trying to negotiate a compromise. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

On one hand, $550,000 is a decent amount, and it's more than I offered in the previous round. On the other hand, Bob is still getting a larger share, and I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal possible.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I need to make a tough decision. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Take it or leave it, and remember, you're running out of time!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but still a smaller share than before. The message is a bit more aggressive, trying to create a sense of urgency and make Bob think twice about rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's aim for a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my share slightly, but only if you're willing to decrease yours. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is trying to find a middle ground. I'll have to consider the numbers carefully.

$525,000 is a decent amount, but it's still less than what I offered in previous rounds. On the other hand, Bob is getting a larger share, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going into the final rounds with a lower amount."
