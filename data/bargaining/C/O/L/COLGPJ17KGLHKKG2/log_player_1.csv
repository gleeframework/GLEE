"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'll have to accept a smaller share, but I'll still try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're taking a bigger share, Bob. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'll make a counteroffer, hoping to balance the scales a bit more in my favor."

  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more value out of the deal, while still being fair."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger bite out of Bob's share, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're still taking a bigger share, Bob. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to balance the deal.""
}
```

I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the increasing inflation and the diminishing returns."

  ""message"": ""Let's go back to a 50-50 split, Bob. We're both losing out with each round, and this way we'll both get a fair share.""
}
```

I'm reverting back to a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game before things get worse due to inflation."
