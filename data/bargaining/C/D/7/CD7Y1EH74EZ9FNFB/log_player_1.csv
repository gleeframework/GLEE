I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping for a quick resolution and avoiding unnecessary inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, even accounting for inflation. I will reject and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering a significant portion to Bob.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing and end the game before the inflation hurts us both too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse for me, despite the inflation affecting him as well.  I'm still hoping to get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and continue the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

With the inflation hitting hard, I need to secure a better deal for myself. This offer gives a larger share to Bob, but I'm still aiming for a reasonable outcome, hoping to avoid a completely unfavorable deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money.  At this point, accepting is the best option to avoid further losses and ensure I receive at least something."
