"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I'll start by offering a division where I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer early on, avoiding further rounds and the negative impact of inflation on my potential gain. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation affects us differently. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 10% less in this round, Bob's offer of $4,000 for me is actually equivalent to $3,600 in the first round's value. Considering the impact of inflation and the fact that Bob is trying to take advantage of it, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a division where I receive $5,800 and Bob receives $4,200. Given that the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'm actually offering Bob a relatively better deal compared to my initial offer, while also trying to maximize my own gain. The message aims to convey that I'm taking the inflation into account and trying to find a mutually acceptable split. Your turn!"
