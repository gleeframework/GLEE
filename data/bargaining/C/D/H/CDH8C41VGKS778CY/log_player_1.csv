"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll give you a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $240,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is also affected by inflation, but I don't know the exact value for him.

I'm not thrilled with the 50-70 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the next round of inflation, my gain will be worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the first to propose!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think you're getting a bit too close to the original 60-40 split! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the next round of inflation, my gain of $420,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $204,000. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
