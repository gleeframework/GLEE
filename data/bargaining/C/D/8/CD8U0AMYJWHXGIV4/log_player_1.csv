Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a high offer in the first round, hoping Bob will accept. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but with the inflation, it's better than taking the chance of getting less in the next round."
