Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to secure a good amount before inflation starts to bite. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a smaller share rather than risk getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is simply a reversal of mine. It seems he is following a similar strategy of trying to secure a large share early. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm dropping my share by 100,000 this round to keep Bob engaged, but still aiming for a majority share. Inflation is starting to hurt, so I need to secure a deal soon."
