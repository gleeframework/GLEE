Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split.  Let's give me a slight edge to make up for the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give Bob a 10% advantage. I'll reject this offer.
