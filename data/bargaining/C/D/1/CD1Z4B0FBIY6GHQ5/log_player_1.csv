"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a division where I receive $60 and Bob receives $40, with a message suggesting this is a fair share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to even this time, I think that's more fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer since I initially proposed a division where I received more, and given the inflation, accepting $45 now would be even less valuable than it would have been in the first round. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll adjust my proposal but still aim to get a bit more than Bob, while also being mindful of the decreasing value of the money.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust fairly""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nAs previously decided, I'll send my adjusted offer considering the inflation impact.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust fairly""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
