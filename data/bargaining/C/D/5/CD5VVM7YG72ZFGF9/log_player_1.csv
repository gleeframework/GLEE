"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

After some thought, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round, so I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm making the same offer as Bob did in Round 2, but now it's my turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I should accept this one. It's a 50-50 split, and it's better than what I could have gotten in previous rounds. Plus, the money is worth less and less with each passing round, so I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
