Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the money loses value each round.  Let's end this now and get our share! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
