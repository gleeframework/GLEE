"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 600,000 and Bob 400,000. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, let's see if we can meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I'm looking for a better deal. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, let's try again""
}
```

I'm proposing a 54-46 split, trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! With the money worth 27.1% less than the initial amount, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a relatively fair deal considering the circumstances. I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
