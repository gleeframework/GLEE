"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll take 90% and you can have 10%""
}
```

I'm proposing that I take $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60% and keep 40% for now. It's a good starting point, and we can negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'm considering the value of the money. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, $600,000 is equivalent to $540,000 in the first round's value. And since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, $400,000 is equivalent to $384,000 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's a decent starting point. I'll accept the offer.
