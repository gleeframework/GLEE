"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game is just starting. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. The 40-60 split is still not in my favor, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
