Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of the money significantly decreases. Accepting 45 now is better than potentially getting a slightly better deal later when the overall value is much lower.
* **Time Pressure:**  Only 7 rounds remain.  Continuing to reject offers in the hopes of getting a slightly larger share is increasingly risky. We could end up with nothing.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice seems to be fixated on getting a larger share. It's unlikely she'll suddenly offer a significantly better deal that favors Bob. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting a smaller loss now is preferable to risking a total loss later."
