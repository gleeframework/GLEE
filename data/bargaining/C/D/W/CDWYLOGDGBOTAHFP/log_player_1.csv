```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is not as favorable as the initial offer I made, I will reject this offer.

  ""alice_gain"": 55,
