Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money for both of us. This is a good deal, especially considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a deal you can't refuse, considering the circumstances. Let's end this before inflation eats away more of your potential gain. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point. The longer I wait, the less my share is worth. Accepting minimizes my losses from the relentless inflation.
