"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting our respective negotiating power. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to mirror my previous offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that our negotiating power is reflected in a 60/40 split, and I'd like to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, my offer is worth 5% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can end this""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, trying to find a compromise that's more favorable to me."
