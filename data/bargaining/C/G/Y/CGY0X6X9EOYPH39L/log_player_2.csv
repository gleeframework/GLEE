"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this is a fair split considering we're both losing money as time goes on. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a larger share. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split. If we don't agree soon, the money will be worth even less to me.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and not losing too much value over time. This offer reflects that. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but your previous offer was too low for me. This offer is a compromise, taking into account the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the money is worth 9.75% less to me now, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since Alice is not affected by inflation, she might be more willing to compromise to end the game sooner. I'll take the risk and see what the next round brings. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still need a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Let's settle this before it's too late!""}\n\nGiven that the money's value is decreasing by 5% for me with each round, and we're now in the fourth round, I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a fair share and minimizing further loss due to inflation. This offer is an attempt to find a mutually acceptable compromise, slightly adjusting my previous offer to be more appealing to Alice while still considering my own interests."
