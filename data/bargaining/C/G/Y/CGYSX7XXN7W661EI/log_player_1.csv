"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she receives $60 and Bob receives $40, with a message suggesting that this division is fair. Given the rules of the game, Alice has an incentive to try to reach an agreement quickly to avoid the devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds. Bob, on the other hand, might be inclined to delay, knowing that the value of the money does not decrease for him, potentially giving him leverage in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60 this time, but we can keep talking. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice rejects Bob's offer of $40 for her and $60 for him. Given the impact of inflation, Alice's $40 in the second round is worth less than the $40 she would have received in the first round. Since the value of money decreases for Alice with each round, she has an incentive to try to secure a better deal rather than accepting an offer that becomes less valuable over time. By rejecting, Alice aims to propose a more favorable division in the next round, hoping to maximize her gain despite the devaluation of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway before it devalues further""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she receives $55 and Bob receives $45, with a message urging Bob to accept this compromise before the value of the money devalues further for her. Alice has reduced her initial demand, attempting to find a middle ground that Bob might find acceptable. The pressure of inflation, which affects only Alice, creates an urgency for her to reach an agreement sooner rather than later, prompting her to seek a mutually agreeable solution in this round."
