"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you 400k, a fair start. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation rates. Since Bob loses 5% of the value of the money with each round, it makes sense to try and negotiate a better deal. Additionally, Alice is losing 20% of the money's value with each round, making her more likely to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less this time, but let's get this deal done before the value of the money drops too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but don't think you're getting off that easy! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The inflation rates are working against Alice more than me. Her gains are depreciating faster than mine.
* **Alice's Message:** Her message indicates she's willing to compromise, suggesting she wants to close the deal.
* **Gain:** Although I'm getting less than my initial offer, the inflation would likely have caused me to lose more if we continued to reject offers.

While I'd prefer a bigger share, accepting this offer is the most rational choice given the current circumstances."
