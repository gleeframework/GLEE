"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, a fair start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less this time, but let's get this deal done before the value of the money drops too much. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the value of the money has decreased, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I want to get a better deal before it's too late.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

}
```
