"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but not too big 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure I want to accept Bob's offer, even though it's a slightly bigger share for me. I think I can do better than 30% of the total. I'll reject this offer and make a new one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 75% is a fair share for me.""}

I'm proposing that I get $75 and Bob gets $25."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a big share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, and considering the inflation, I'm willing to accept this offer. 80% of the original $100 is a decent share, and I'm not sure I can do better than this. I'll accept Bob's offer."
