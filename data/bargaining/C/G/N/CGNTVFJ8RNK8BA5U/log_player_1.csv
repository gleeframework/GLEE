I'll think for a moment... 

I don't think 50/50 is a bad offer, but I can do better than that too!

Hmm... 60/40 is a pretty big swing in his favor. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.

Do you accept this offer?","Bob is getting aggressive!

30/70 is an even more lopsided split, and I'm getting worried that I'll be left with nothing if I don't act soon.

I'm not going to give in to his pressure, though. I'll make one more offer to try to salvage a decent share.
