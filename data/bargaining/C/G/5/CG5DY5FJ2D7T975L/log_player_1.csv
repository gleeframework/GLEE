"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a 60-40 split, with me getting the larger share. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful. Bob's offer is still a 40-60 split, but the reduced value of the money makes it less appealing to me. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 40-60, I'll try to counter with a more favorable split for myself. Given the severe inflation, I'll aim for a 50-50 split, but with a slight bias towards myself to account for the reduced value of the money. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5100, ""bob_gain"": 4900}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the extreme inflation, the money is almost worthless. Bob's offer is a 30-70 split, which is quite unfavorable to me. I'll have to be careful not to accept an offer that leaves me with a very small share of the remaining value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the extremely low value of the money, I'll aim for a very high percentage of the remaining value. Given the 40.95% loss in value for me and 67.23% loss in value for Bob, I'll propose a very high share for myself. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 9500, ""bob_gain"": 500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the extremely low value of the money, Bob's offer is still a 20-80 split, which is quite unfavorable to me. However, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round. I'll accept this offer, as it's still a relatively small share, but it's better than risking waiting for an even worse offer.
