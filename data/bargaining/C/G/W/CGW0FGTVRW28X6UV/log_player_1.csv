  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share""
}

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, but this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll gain $50, which is worth 95% of the original $80 I was offered in Round 1. That's $76.
