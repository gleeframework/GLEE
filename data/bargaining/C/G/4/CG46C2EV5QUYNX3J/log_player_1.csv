"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more equitable.  It reflects our equal contribution to the game, and leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
