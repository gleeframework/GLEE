"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this round, the total amount of money is still $10,000, but the value of my gain is reduced by 20%. So, if I were to accept Bob's offer, I'd be getting $4000, which is equivalent to $5000 in the first round. This is a relatively good deal for me, considering the reduced value of money.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
