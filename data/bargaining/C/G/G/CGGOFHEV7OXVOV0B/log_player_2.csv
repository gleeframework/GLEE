Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that split. How about we meet in the middle and both take 50% this round? It's still a loss for both of us due to inflation, but at least it's a fair loss.

# Alice gain: 5500
