"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make his move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less after the first round, I'll receive $5,000, which is 5% less than the $5,250 I would have received in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
