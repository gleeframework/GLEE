**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her potential winnings decreases.  While this offer is slightly better than her initial one, I believe I can push for an even better outcome in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is the most straightforward and fair split. Take it before the value drops further.""} 

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to push for an even split.  While I might be able to get slightly more in the next round or two, there's a risk that Alice might get desperate and offer a deal worse than this. A 50/50 split is clean, fair, and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
