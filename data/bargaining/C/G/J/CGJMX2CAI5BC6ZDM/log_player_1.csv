```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to get the game started and see how Bob responds."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the majority, huh?

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to give up 20% of the money that Bob would have gotten in the first round. I'll wait for a better offer."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""

Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly!

I'm not thrilled about giving up a bigger share, but I'm getting desperate...

```

```

I'll hold out for a better offer, but it's getting harder to resist the temptation of getting some money now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now...

I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer, but still keep some room for negotiation:

  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still want a decent share. Meet me in the middle?""

  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, but I'm not giving up completely. Take what you want, but I'll take what I can get.""
}
```

I'm offering a small share to Bob, but I'm not going to give up without a fight."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm almost there, don't stand in my way 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It's getting desperate...

I'm not thrilled about giving up 90% of the money, but I'm running out of time and options...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to hold out for a tiny bit longer, but it's getting increasingly unlikely that I'll get a better offer."

  ""message"": ""I'm out of options. Take the rest, I'm done.""
}
```

I'm giving up on any hope of getting a decent share and just want to get this over with."
