"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I'll take the bigger share this time, but you'll get a chance to propose in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd rather propose a more balanced split in the next round than accept this uneven offer, especially considering the impact of inflation on my share. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's aim for a more balanced split, considering I'm already losing value due to inflation.""}\n\nSince I'm the one affected by inflation, I'll try to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value over the rounds. Hopefully, this more balanced offer will be appealing to Alice."
