"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  I figure this is a good starting point since I'm the first to propose.  It's a large enough share for me to feel satisfied, and I'm hoping Bob will see that accepting this is better than risking a smaller share in the future rounds where the value of the money decreases for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to risk another round.  The inflation is hurting me, but I'm not willing to give up this much money just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed gain to 700,000, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal than Bob's offer in round 2. This is a compromise, and I hope Bob will see that it's better for him than waiting another round and potentially getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I gain. Accepting Bob's offer, even though it's less than I initially hoped for, is the best option to ensure I get something.  I'm taking a significant loss, but it's better than getting nothing."
