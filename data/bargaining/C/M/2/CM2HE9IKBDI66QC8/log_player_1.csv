"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decrease in value, I propose a more balanced distribution to ensure fairness. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the decrease in value due to inflation.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 60% is a fair share for me, considering the initial offer I made was 90%. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decrease in value, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share than in my initial offer."
