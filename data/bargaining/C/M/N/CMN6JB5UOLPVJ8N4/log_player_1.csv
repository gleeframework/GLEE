Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000.  I'm aiming for a large share in the first round, as the inflation will reduce my gains in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation has significantly reduced my gains, and accepting this offer guarantees me at least some money.  Waiting for another round risks getting nothing, as the inflation will continue to erode my potential gains."
