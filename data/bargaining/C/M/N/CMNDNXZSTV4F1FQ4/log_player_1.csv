Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer for Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, I think it's better to accept this offer. With each round, the risk of getting nothing increases, and Bob's offer is still a fair split."
