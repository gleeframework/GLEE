Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, that's too low for me.  Let's be realistic. I propose a 70/30 split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I'll give you 25% this time.  If we keep going back and forth, the value of the money will decrease for both of us. It's in our best interest to reach a deal. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hurting me more than her, but I need to hold out for a more equitable split. Accepting 25% now would be significantly less than what I could have gotten in the first round."
