"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Since the money will be worth less to Alice in the next round, it's in Bob's best interest to try and get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think it's important to start with a split that benefits us both. This way, we can ensure a win-win scenario.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50/50 and reassess from here. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
