Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn! I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  I know the value of the money decreases each round. While Alice's offer wasn't terrible, I can do better, especially since the money is worth less to her in each subsequent round.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By making a somewhat generous offer (slightly more than a 50/50 split), I increase the chances of Alice accepting. She's losing value at a slower rate, so she might be tempted to take a decent deal now.
* **Clear Communication:** My message aims to be friendly but firm, reminding Alice that time is of the essence."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Declining Value:**  The money is losing value rapidly. While Alice's offer is closer to the middle, it's still not in my best interest, especially given the accelerating inflation. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Alice is likely feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. By rejecting this offer, I'm betting she'll be more willing to concede further in the next round to avoid even greater losses.
* **Holding Firm:** I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair share. Consistently rejecting offers that don't meet my needs sends a strong signal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out! This is my final offer, let's make a deal.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** This offer emphasizes the rapidly declining value of the money. By framing it as a ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Slight Concession:**  I've reduced my demand slightly from the previous round to make it more palatable for Alice, but it's still a favorable split for me. 
* **Aiming for Acceptance:**  I believe this offer represents a good balance between maximizing my gains and the risk of Alice rejecting and the money losing even more value."
