I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unfavorable, and the risk of inflation is becoming more pronounced.

```

The risk of inflation is escalating, and Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unfavorable. I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to secure a substantial share.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

With only a few rounds remaining and inflation hitting hard, I need to take a more pragmatic approach. I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a considerable share.  Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unfavorable, and I believe he's starting to feel the pressure of the shrinking value of money.  Hopefully, this offer will be enough to get him to accept before we both end up with nothing."

```

Bob's offer is now very unfavorable, but I'm still not ready to accept.  With only two rounds remaining, I believe there's still a chance to get a better deal. The inflation is significant, but I'm not going to give up without a fight.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize the danger of continuing to reject offers and agree to something more equitable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only one round left, I'm forced to make a more drastic compromise. This 50/50 offer is my last chance to secure any money at all. The risk of inflation is extremely high, and if we both refuse, we'll get nothing.  This seems like the fairest outcome given the circumstances."
