9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  Let me know what you think!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it down the middle, 50/50 is fair for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I'm willing to compromise.  How about 60/40?  It's still more than what you offered, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing at all.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think 55/45 is a more reasonable compromise, considering I'm losing value each round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Okay, I'm getting a little worried now.  Let's try 70/30.  It's still more in your favor than the previous round, and we can finally finish this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the inflation, I think 60/40 is a fair offer now. I'm losing value each round, so I need a bit more to compensate.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"I'm starting to get nervous about getting nothing at all.  Let's try 80/20. It's a big concession, but I'd rather have something than nothing.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Considering the significant loss of value due to inflation, I think 65/35 is a reasonable offer now. I'm taking on more risk by continuing, so I need a larger share to compensate.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
9000.0,1000.0,"This is getting risky. I'm willing to go back to my original offer of 90/10.  It's a lot, but with only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Given the substantial loss of value and the risk of getting nothing, I think 70/30 is a fair offer now. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I need to prioritize my own gain due to inflation.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
9500.0,500.0,"We're running out of time! I'm willing to give you 500 to take 9500. It's a very high price, but I need to ensure I get something at all.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"This is the final round, and considering the significant loss of value due to inflation, I'm taking a firm stance on an 80/20 split. It's the best I can offer given the circumstances.",Bob,12,
