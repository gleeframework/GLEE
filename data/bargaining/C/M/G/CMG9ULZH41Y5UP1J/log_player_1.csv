"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the bigger share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is actually worth $32 in the previous round's value.

I think Bob's offer is a more even split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too little for me, I'll make a better offer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is now worth $32 in the previous round's value, and that's 25.6% of the original $100 (since 32 / 100 = 0.32 and 1 - 0.32 = 0.68, and 0.68 * 100 = 68, but I'm considering the 32 dollars in the previous round's value, so I'll use that as the base for the new offer). 

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 50/50 split""
}
```"
