"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
``` 

This offer is a fair starting point, as it gives a slight advantage to Bob to incentivize him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better for me than the previous one, it's still not fair considering the inflation. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than in my first offer, acknowledging the inflation and taking into account the risk of continuing to reject his offer.  This offer is still close to my previous offer, which was rejected by Bob, so I am optimistic that it will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is worse than my previous ones, the inflation has hit me hard and I'm no longer confident I can get a better deal. Accepting this offer will at least ensure I get some money, even if it is less than I initially hoped for."
