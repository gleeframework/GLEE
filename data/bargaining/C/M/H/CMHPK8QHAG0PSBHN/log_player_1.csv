"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you can do better than that, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, the money is now worth less to me.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 3:7 split. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This is a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I need to be careful.

Bob's new offer is a 45:55 split, which is even more favorable to him than my previous offer. I'm not sure if I want to give up more, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can still do better than a 45:55 split. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. A 50:50 split seems fair.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's a compromise that benefits both of us."
