"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer.

Here's my proposal:
```
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```
I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% decrease in value of the money I gain.

Here's my proposal:
```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```
I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
