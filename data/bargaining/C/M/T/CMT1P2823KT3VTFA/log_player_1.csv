"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and leave Bob with $10.  It's a pretty hefty offer, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in getting something rather than nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's not as much as I hoped for, but it's better than getting nothing in the end!  I'll accept Bob's offer."
