"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the urgency of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
