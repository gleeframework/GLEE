"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, my gain of 4000 in the second round is actually worth less than my gain of 6000 in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
