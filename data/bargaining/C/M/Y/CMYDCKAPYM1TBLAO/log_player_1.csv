I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  I figure this is a good starting point, giving me the majority of the money while still offering Bob a small amount to potentially encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a significant increase from his previous offer. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a majority of the money.  Since the inflation is hurting me more than Bob, I want to make sure I secure a good portion of the money now."
