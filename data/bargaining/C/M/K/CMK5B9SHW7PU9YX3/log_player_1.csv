Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a greedy strategy in the first round. I'm taking the lion's share, but still leaving Bob with a small amount. This is to see if I can secure a good deal early on and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation is a significant factor. I'm taking a substantial hit on my potential earnings, and it's likely to get worse if I reject this offer.  It's better to secure some money now than risk losing more in subsequent rounds."
