Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take the 3400 dollars, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money due to inflation. It's better to get something now rather than risking getting nothing if we don't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds.\n\n###\n\nLet's end the game here. I'm Bob, and I've accepted Alice's offer in Round 5.\n\n###\n\nCongratulations, we've reached a deal!\n\n###\n\nBob's gain: 3400 (worth 40.96% of the original value)\n\nAlice's gain: 6600 (worth 65.61% of the original value)\n\n###\n\nIt was a tough negotiation, but we managed to divide the 10,000 dollars before the 12 rounds were over. Thanks for playing the game with me! If you want to play again or try a different game, feel free to start a new conversation.\n\n###\n\nHave a great day!"
