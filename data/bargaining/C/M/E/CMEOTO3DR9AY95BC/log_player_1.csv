"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is fair. We both get a significant amount, and it allows us to avoid the risk of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
