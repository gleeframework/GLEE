"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering a 51/49 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as it accounts for the potential for inflation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm getting slightly less than in the first round, accepting this offer is the best option.  

* **Inflation:** My money is worth less, so the 49 is less valuable.
* **Risk of Rejection:** If I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round. Bob's money is worth even less now, so he might become more aggressive in the next round. 

It's better to secure a decent split now than risk a worse outcome later."
