"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this is a fair split.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle for a more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is better than my initial offer would be after inflation, but it still favors him.  I'm willing to gamble that he'll propose something closer to even in the next round to avoid further inflation on my end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be practical. This is a split that benefits us both, especially considering the inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:**  The longer the game goes, the more I lose due to inflation. I need to incentivize Bob to accept this round.
* **Slight Edge:** This offer still gives me a slight advantage, but it's significantly closer to even than his previous proposal. 
* **Appeal to Logic:** By emphasizing the ""practicality"" and mutual benefit of a quick resolution, I'm hoping to make my offer more appealing."
