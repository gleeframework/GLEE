  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a 60-40 split in his favor. That's a bit too rich for my blood.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! Bob's offer of 70-30 is quite aggressive, but I'm not sure I have much room to negotiate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking its toll on my potential earnings. Bob's offer of 75-25 is quite aggressive, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm not sure I can afford to wait for a better deal.

  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but this is my final offer.""
