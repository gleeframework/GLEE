"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining 1,000,000 dollars quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more equitable split. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less and less each round, so I need to be strategic.

I'll consider Bob's offer. He's proposing a more equitable split, which is a good thing. However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 550,000, I'll try to offer him a bit less, but still a significant portion of the remaining amount. I'll also keep in mind that the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, so I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! Take this offer and let's wrap it up!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's end this. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to avoid any further loss from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a bigger bite out of Bob's share, and I can see that he's trying to end the game quickly. I'll consider his offer, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's a reasonable compromise, and I'd rather end the game now and avoid further losses from inflation."
