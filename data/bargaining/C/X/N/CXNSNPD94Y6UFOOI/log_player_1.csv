Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm taking a slight advantage with this offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a more even split, I'm not sure I can get a better deal considering the inflation and limited rounds.  I'll accept this offer."
