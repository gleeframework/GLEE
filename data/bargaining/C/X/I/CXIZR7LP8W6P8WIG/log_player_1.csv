"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started, I'll give you a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, hoping to make him want to negotiate and make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable proposal. Splitting the money evenly seems fair, and it's a decent compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
