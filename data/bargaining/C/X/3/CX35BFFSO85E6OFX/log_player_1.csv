"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```
I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and Bob gets the remaining 30%, which is $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since I'd be getting $450,000, which is worth 90% of the original $500,000 I would have gotten in the first round, and Bob would be getting $550,000, which is worth 80% of the original $687,500 he would have gotten in the first round, I'll decide to accept this offer.
