"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000

It's better to see if I can get a better deal. I'll let Alice know I'm not happy with this split and try to negotiate something more favorable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it closer to the middle.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm concerned about inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's a decent improvement on the previous round."
