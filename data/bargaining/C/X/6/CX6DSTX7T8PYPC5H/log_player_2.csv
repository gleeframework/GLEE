"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight edge to me for going first. This ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's tempting to accept a ""fair"" offer, but remember the inflation! You lose 5% each round, so getting slightly less now means you'll get significantly less in later rounds.  Rejecting gives you a chance to make a better proposal for yourself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm taking into account the inflation factor, so I'm proposing a split that gives me a slightly larger share. This ensures a better outcome for both of us in the long run.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts you more than me.  I'm offering a reasonable split that's slightly better for me than last round. Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Alice's offer is a bit better than the last one, I'm still going to reject. The inflation is really hurting me, and I need to hold out for a deal that gives me a bigger share to make up for that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and inflation is only going to get worse. I'm proposing a more substantial split in my favor, which will help us both avoid getting nothing at all. Let's be pragmatic and make this deal happen.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and walk away. Any more delays and the inflation will eat away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While an even split sounds appealing, I can't accept it. Even though Alice is being stubborn, I can still make a better deal for myself. With each passing round, the inflation is making my share worth less and less.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. It's time to be realistic and make a deal. My proposal is fair considering the inflation, and it's the best way for both of us to maximize our gains. Let's not risk losing everything.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but you're leaving me no choice. I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's final offer is better than getting nothing at all. Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, accepting this offer will at least give me something. It's time to be pragmatic and cut my losses."
