"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for being a better negotiator! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, my potential gain is now worth 60% of the original amount.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 30-70 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 20% inflation, the money is now worth 80% of its original value. My goal is to get as much as I can.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a relatively close division of the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for being a better negotiator! You're getting a better deal than in the first round, so take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is now worth 51.2% of its original value. My potential gain is worth significantly less than in the previous rounds.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 20-80 split, especially considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, the money is now worth 51.2% of its original value. My goal is to get as much as I can from the reduced amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 280000,
  ""bob_gain"": 720000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I'm not going to give up too much more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 28-72 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the reduced value of the money."
