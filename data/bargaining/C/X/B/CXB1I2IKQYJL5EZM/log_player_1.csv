# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to be fair, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the better deal here. Considering the inflation, my gain of 500,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round (100% - 20% = 80%). I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
