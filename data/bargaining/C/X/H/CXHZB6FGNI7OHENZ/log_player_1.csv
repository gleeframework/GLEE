"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more balanced split, but I'll give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is now worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $5,000 (worth $5,500 in real value)
Bob gain: $4,500 (worth $5,000 in real value)

I think this is a fair offer, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
