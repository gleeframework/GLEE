# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but I need to hold my ground a bit longer.  The inflation is hurting, but accepting this offer would mean I lose more than half of the original value. I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable in the next couple of rounds as the deadline approaches."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing your share 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation is killing my potential gains. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the rational choice at this point. If I reject it and Alice doesn't become drastically more generous in the next round or two, I risk ending up with nothing."
