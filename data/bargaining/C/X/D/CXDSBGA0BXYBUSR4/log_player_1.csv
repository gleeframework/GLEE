Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take the lion's share, but I want to make sure Bob gets something so he's more likely to accept.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 927272.73 
# Bob gain: 72727.27 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While it's less than my initial proposal, Bob's counter-offer is still significantly better for me than if we continue playing and face further inflation.  I'm confident I can live with this outcome."
