"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is more generous than I expected.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $5,000 and Bob will take $5,000. It's a fair split, and I'm willing to end the game here."
