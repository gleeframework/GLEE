"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is ticking - this is a good deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting impatient, take it or leave it 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Even though the inflation is hitting hard, accepting this offer would mean I get even less of the original value than in Alice's previous offer. It's a gamble, but I need to hold out for a better deal while I still have some negotiating power left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be realistic.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to settle this before inflation eats away at everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, but the clock is really working against me now. Accepting this offer nets me 3500$, which is significantly less than my previous offers, but rejecting it means risking getting even less in the following rounds due to the brutal inflation.  Alice knows time is on her side, so she's unlikely to offer anything better. It's painful, but better a smaller share than nothing at all."
