"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's agree now and not risk losing more money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to negotiate. This offer is better for me than yours, but still leaves you with a good amount.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. This offer is fair considering the inflation, and we can avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. While he is offering a compromise from his previous offer, he is ignoring the fact that the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a serious offer. We're getting close to the point where the inflation makes this pointless for me. This offer ensures we both benefit.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every round. This offer is a fair compromise. Let's end this before we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:** The inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. While this offer isn't ideal, accepting it now guarantees me something, whereas continuing to reject Bob's offers in hopes of a slightly better deal carries a significant risk of ending up with nothing.  It's time to cut my losses and accept a reasonable, though not perfect, offer."
