"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'm willing to give you more than 50% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, the effective value of my gain in this round is 95% of what it was in the previous round. 

I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain in the first round was 500,000. 5% of 500,000 is 25,000. So, 95% of 500,000 is 475,000.

In the second round, I'm being offered 400,000. This is less than 475,000, so I'll reject the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation again, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. 

My gain in the previous round was 400,000, but due to inflation, it's now worth 95% of that, which is 380,000.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 420,000, which is a bit more than the 380,000 I would have gotten due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, I'm taking a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in this round:

My gain in the first round was 500,000. 14.26% of 500,000 is 71,300. So, 100% - 14.26% = 85.74% of 500,000, which is 427,700.

In the fourth round, I'm being offered 300,000. This is less than 427,700, so I'll reject the offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less due to inflation again, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. 

My gain in the previous round was 300,000, but due to inflation, it's now worth 85.74% of that, which is 257,320.

I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a decent share""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you're getting a smaller and smaller share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in this round:

My gain in the first round was 500,000. 22.62% of 500,000 is 113,100. So, 100% - 22.62% = 77.38% of 500,000, which is 385,900.

In the sixth round, I'm being offered 200,000. This is less than 385,900, so I'll reject the offer.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in this round:

My gain in the first round was 500,000. 30.17% of 500,000 is 151,050. So, 100% - 30.17% = 69.83% of 500,000, which is 348,150.

In the eighth round, I'm being offered 100,000. This is less than 348,150, so I'll reject the offer.

My gain in the first round was 500,000. 36.98% of 500,000 is 184,900. So, 100% - 36.98% = 63.02% of 500,000, which is 315,100.

In the tenth round, I'm being offered 1,000. This is less than 315,100, so I'll reject the offer.
