I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to play ball early on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, it's better to accept this offer before the inflation hits even harder."
