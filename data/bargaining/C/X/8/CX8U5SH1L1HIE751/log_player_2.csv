Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make up for the lost value.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's think about this:

* **Time Pressure:** We're getting closer to the deadline, with only 9 rounds left.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** While Alice's offer is better than her first, the money is rapidly losing value. Accepting now might seem tempting, but there's a chance for a better deal later.
* **Negotiating Position:** By rejecting her offer again, I signal that I'm serious about getting a more significant share, especially with the accelerated inflation working against me. 

I believe there's still room to negotiate a more favorable outcome."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and the value is plummeting. Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the entire amount.""
