Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, aiming to get a large share of the money.  I'm taking a gamble that Bob might be willing to accept a smaller portion rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a much more equitable offer than the first round, and considering the inflation, it's a good deal for me.  I'd rather take 5000 now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
