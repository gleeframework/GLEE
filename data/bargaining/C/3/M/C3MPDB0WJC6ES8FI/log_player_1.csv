"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think 80 is a fair minimum. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the relative values. In terms of the original $100, I would be getting $22 (20 / 0.9) and Bob would be getting $80 (80 / 0.8).

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to get a better share, but I'll also leave some room for negotiation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for my efforts.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than the previous offer, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm not willing to give up much more. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on me! With the money worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

In terms of the original $100, I would be getting $7.33 (10 / 0.371) and Bob would be getting $90 (90 / 0.519).

Considering the extremely low value of the money, I think I should take what I can get. I'll accept the offer to avoid getting even less in future rounds.
