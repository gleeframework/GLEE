"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that with each round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for me than for Bob. This split seems fair given the conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation disparity, how about a slightly better deal for me this round? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting 4500 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a lower amount in the first round, due to the 20% decrease in value for me. I'll reject and propose a new offer in the next round, hoping to maximize my gain considering the decreasing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Equal split to mitigate further loss from inflation""}\n\nConsidering we've both lost value due to inflation, and the game could theoretically go on indefinitely with both of us losing more value, I'm proposing an equal split. This way, we both get something, and we mitigate further loss from inflation. It's a fair deal given the circumstances."
