"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so the effective amount I'd gain is $4000 * 0.8 = $3200.

I'll think about it... Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has already taken a toll on the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You took the lead, now it's my turn to make a strong offer!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly skewed split in my favor, but still a decent share for Bob. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take it up a notch, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me now! The money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I'd gain is $3500 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = $1803.80.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the low amount I'd receive. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really hurting me now! In this round, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I'd gain is $3500 * 0.516 = $1803.80, but since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, the effective amount I'd gain is $1803.80 * 0.8 = $1443.04.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm making a strong push for a better deal. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation, but still keeping some room for negotiation."
