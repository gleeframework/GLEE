"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 5500/4500 split in my favor. This takes into account the decreasing value of the money, but still offers you a reasonable share. Let's end this early and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
