"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a good deal for me! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now looking at a reduced amount.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better. His offer is still skewed towards him, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to push the ratio a bit more in my favor, but still being reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep some for myself! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain even more, I'm getting desperate. However, Bob's offer is still not as favorable as I'd like, and I'm starting to think he's not willing to give me a good deal.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation eating away at my potential gain, I need to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I need a better deal, or I'll walk away!""
}
```

I'm pushing the ratio even further in my favor, but I'm still being cautious. I don't want to give up too much, but I need to make a move. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. You're getting desperate, but I'm not giving in! 
# Alice gain: 620000 
# Bob gain: 380000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll on my potential gain, I'm getting really desperate. Bob's offer is still not as good as I'd like, but I'm starting to think I might not have many more chances to negotiate.

I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits...
