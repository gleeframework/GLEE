"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount, and I'm hoping he'll take it to avoid going into the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle and end this game quickly! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'd be getting $400,000 (0.8 x $500,000) if I accept this offer. It's a decent split, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'd rather try to negotiate for more.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, I'll offer Bob a smaller share to make up for it. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, but this is still a good offer!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less, I'd be getting only $400,000 (0.516 x $777,777.78) if I accept this offer. Considering the decreasing value of money, I think this is a decent compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further inflation.
