"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. In this round, the $4,000 I would gain is actually worth 80% of the original $4,000, which is $3,200. And the $6,000 Bob would gain is worth 95% of the original $6,000, which is $5,700.

I'll decide to reject this offer, as I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to Round 2. Let's calculate the values:

My gain in Round 2 was $3,200, so in Round 3, it's 80% of that, which is $2,560.
Bob's gain in Round 2 was $5,700, so in Round 3, it's 95% of that, which is $5,415.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $7,000 and keeping $3,000 for myself."
