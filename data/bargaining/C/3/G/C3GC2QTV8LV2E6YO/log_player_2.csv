I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a good starting point, I think I can do better in the next few rounds, especially since the money loses value for me with each round."

I'm still going to reject. While it's closer to what I want, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next few rounds. The inflation is significant, but I believe I can negotiate a better split."
