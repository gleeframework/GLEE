I'll start by offering a fair but slightly skewed deal.  I'll keep $90, and Bob gets $10.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I'd be happy with $10, I know he's getting a much better deal.  I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time. I'll take $55 and give Bob $45.  I think this is a good compromise, considering the inflation factor."
