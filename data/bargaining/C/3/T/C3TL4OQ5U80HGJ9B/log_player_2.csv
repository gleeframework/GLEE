"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid inflation. I take a bit more as the first proposer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Although Alice's proposal seems fair on the surface, the inflation rate means that I would only get $4,000 out of the $10,000, while Alice would get $6,000. I think I can do better than that in the next round, especially if I can convince Alice to take less since the money will be worth less for me each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split this more evenly.  I'm taking a bit more this round since inflation will eat away at my share next round.  I'm hoping we can find a fair split that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting you more than me.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than my last offer, but I need you to meet me halfway. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although I'd still prefer a more even split, the inflation is really starting to hurt.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best way to maximize what I can get at this point."
