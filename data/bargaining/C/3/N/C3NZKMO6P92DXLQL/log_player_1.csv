"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of getting less in the future rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds with the 20% inflation."
