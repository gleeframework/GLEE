Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing money due to inflation.  Let's be practical and split it 50/50 before we get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

It's painful to accept a 50/50 split given the inflation disparity, but with the rapidly declining value of the money, it's the most logical choice. If I reject this offer, we'll likely end up with nothing."
