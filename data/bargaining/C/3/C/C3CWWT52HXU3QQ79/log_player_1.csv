"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he's happy with a small slice of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to accept Bob's offer and secure some money. With the inflation, waiting for more rounds might mean getting even less in the end."
