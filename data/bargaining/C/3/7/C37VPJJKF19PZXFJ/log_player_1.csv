I'm going to start by being somewhat generous, but I want to make sure I get the most out of this deal.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation rate is significant and my gain in this round would be worth 80% of what I initially wanted.  It's better to take the 40 now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
