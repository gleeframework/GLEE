I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This is a pretty generous offer in my opinion, as I am taking a large portion of the money. I'm confident that Bob will accept it."

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller amount than last round, but it's still a decent deal.  I'm willing to compromise a little since Bob rejected my offer."

Bob's offer is getting worse each round, and I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. I still think I can get a better share of the money."

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. With the inflation, I need to secure a good portion to make it worthwhile."

This is a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the inflation. I'm not getting a majority, but it's better than continuing to risk losing more due to inflation."
