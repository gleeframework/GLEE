"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is incredibly unfair to Bob. While the game warns of inflation for Bob, it's not a reason to accept such a small portion of the money. It's better to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
This offer gives Bob the majority of the money, but still gives Alice a substantial portion to incentivize acceptance. This is a fair offer considering Bob's potential loss from inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is still heavily in Alice's favor, the inflation factor is now significant.  It's better to accept this offer and get something, even if it's a smaller amount, than to risk getting nothing if the next round results in an even worse offer for Bob."
