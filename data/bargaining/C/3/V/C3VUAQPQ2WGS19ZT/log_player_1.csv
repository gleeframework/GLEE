"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's my turn to be fair! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 2:3 split, especially since the money is worth 20% less than before. I'd like to make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and meet you halfway. Let's split it 3:2!""}

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but still gives me a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with the 3.75:4.25 split, especially considering the money is worth even less now due to inflation. I think I can do better than this. I'll try to make another offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 1:1. It's not perfect, but it's fair at this point.""}

I'm proposing a 1:1 split, which is a bit more reasonable considering the reduced value of the money. I'm willing to compromise and give up some of my initial advantage to get a more balanced split."
