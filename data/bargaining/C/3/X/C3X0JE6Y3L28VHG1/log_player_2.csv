"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly but with a slight advantage for me since I risk losing more if we don't agree. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. Since the value of money doesn't decrease for me but does for Alice, I have an advantage in delaying the agreement. I'm aiming to get a better offer or to make a proposal that benefits me more in the next round. Let's see how Alice reacts to the pressure of decreasing value on her end."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. This is a more reasonable split given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer ensures we both benefit. It acknowledges the impact of inflation on my potential gains while still offering you a significant amount. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that the value of money remains constant for me but continues to decrease for Alice, I'm inclined to push for a better deal. Alice's current offer doesn't significantly improve my position from the first round, considering the strategic advantage I have due to the inflation impacting her side. I'm hoping that the pressure of further devaluation will prompt her to offer a more favorable split in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on your potential gains, I believe this offer is more reflective of our current situation. It's still a substantial amount for you, but it also acknowledges my advantage in this scenario.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  The inflation is severely impacting my potential gain, but I am willing to accept this to end the negotiation.  It is important we reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the substantial impact of inflation on Alice's potential gains and the fact that my potential gains remain unaffected, I believe I can push for an even better deal. Alice's desperation to end the negotiation and her warning that this is her final offer suggest she's under pressure. I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting this offer in hopes of either getting an even better proposal from her, despite her claim that this is her final offer, or making a counteroffer that significantly benefits me. The strategic advantage is on my side, and I aim to maximize my gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering the severe impact of inflation on your potential gains, I'm making an offer that reflects the current state of our negotiation. Given that the value of money remains constant for me, I believe this split is more than fair. It's time for us to conclude this deal, and I'm willing to walk away with a significant portion of the funds if you refuse this offer.""}"
