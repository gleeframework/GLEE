"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a 40% share of the initial 1,000,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still want a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

Considering the new values, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the reduced purchasing power.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping that I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll aim for a slightly better share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 580,000 dollars, which is a 58% share of the current value of the 1,000,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not giving up too much more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now!

Considering the significant drop in value, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the reduced purchasing power.

However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower-value money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's a fair compromise given the circumstances."
