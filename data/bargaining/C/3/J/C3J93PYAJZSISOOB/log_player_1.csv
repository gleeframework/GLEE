"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a bigger share, I'm feeling lucky! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with less value. I'll accept this offer to avoid further erosion of my potential gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
