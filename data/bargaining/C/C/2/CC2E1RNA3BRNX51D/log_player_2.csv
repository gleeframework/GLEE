Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit my disadvantage with inflation. While this offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm willing to bet she'll fold if I hold out for a bit longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be real. 50/50. Take it before inflation eats our profits!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me due to inflation. Alice knows this and is likely to keep pushing her luck. A 50/50 split is the fairest offer and sends a clear message that I'm serious about reaching a deal before time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 was close, but not quite there 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is running out. While this offer is still tilted in Alice's favor, accepting it nets me more than I would have gotten in the previous round (5000 pre-inflation vs 4100 now). 

Continuing the game is risky. Alice knows I'm feeling the pressure of inflation and might not budge much further. If she continues to lowball, I risk ending up with nothing."
