"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see where we go from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more equitable this time.  I'm willing to take less now to avoid losing even more later. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less, so the numbers are:

Alice's gain: 4,000 x 0.9 = 3,600
Bob's gain: 6,000 x 0.9 = 5,400

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now 9,000 (10,000 x 0.9).

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,000 and keeping $5,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
