I propose keeping 90 dollars for myself and giving Bob 10 dollars. This is a pretty generous offer, but I want to get the most out of this deal.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even with the inflation, 10 dollars is not worth accepting.  I'll take my chances with the next round and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll offer Bob 20 dollars this round, which is double what he got last time.  Hopefully, he sees that it's in his best interest to accept this deal before the inflation hits harder!"
