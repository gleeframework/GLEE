"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll start by proposing a 9000/1000 split. I think it's fair to keep the larger share as I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair.  Let's end this game!"
