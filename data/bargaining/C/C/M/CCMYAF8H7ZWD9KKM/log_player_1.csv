"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial 1,000,000$ and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We both have a chance to get more later if we don't like this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about giving up too much to inflation, but Bob's offer is a decent compromise.
