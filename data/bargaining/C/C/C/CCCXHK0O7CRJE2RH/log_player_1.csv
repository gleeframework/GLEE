"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully... I'd rather not give up 20% of my potential gain, so I'll reject this offer. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a bigger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the significant decrease in value of the money I'd gain, I think I should be more cautious. I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make a better proposal next time.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth only about 51.2% of its original value now, so I'll aim for a bigger share to make up for it. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now!

Considering the drastic decrease in value of the money I'd gain, I think I should be very cautious. However, since the money Bob gains is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think that he might be trying to take advantage of the situation. I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make a more reasonable proposal next time.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth only about 32.77% of its original value now, so I'll aim for a big share to make up for it. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'll try to squeeze out as much as I can from this dwindling pot!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is almost crippling the value of the money now!

Considering the extremely low value of the money I'd gain, I think it's time to be realistic. I'll accept this offer, as it's unlikely that Bob will make a better proposal at this point.
