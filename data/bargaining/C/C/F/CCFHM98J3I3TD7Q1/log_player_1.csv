"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. Fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to fight 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is now worth 90% of $6,000, which is $5,400. Bob's gain is worth 95% of $4,000, which is $3,800.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept the offer, and we can meet in the middle at $5,000 each."
