"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm starting with a fair split, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's a win-win for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the offer carefully.

However, I'm not convinced that splitting the money evenly is the best option for me. I'd rather aim for a slightly higher share.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 40% less for Bob (20% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a fair share too. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting less valuable for Bob with each round, but I'm still aiming for a higher share.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if 60 is enough for me. I'd like to push for a bit more.

However, since Bob's offer is a compromise, I'll accept it for now.
