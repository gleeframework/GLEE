"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more this time, but we can keep things even in the future. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60-40 split, especially with inflation eating into my share.""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 5% toll on my potential gain, I'll aim for a slightly larger share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more this time, but I'm still open to negotiating a fair split.""
}
```"
