"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message to Bob is to let him know that I'm willing to start the negotiation with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, I'll give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In this round, the total amount is still $10,000, but it's worth less due to inflation. My gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of the original value, so it's equivalent to $4,000 in the first round's value. Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of the original value, so it's equivalent to $4,750 in the first round's value.

Considering the reduced values, I think this offer is a good one. I'll accept it.
