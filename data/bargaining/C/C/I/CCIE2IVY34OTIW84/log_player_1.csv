"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as Alice. I want to secure the majority of the funds while still giving Bob a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the funds, but I've lowered my demand slightly to 80% due to the inflation. This offer should be more attractive to Bob, as he's also experiencing inflation, albeit at a lower rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, I believe I can still secure a better deal. Despite the high inflation, I'm still willing to negotiate for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, reducing my share slightly to 70%. The inflation has been substantial, but I'm still aiming for a deal that favors me while recognizing Bob's own inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Despite the severe inflation, I'll accept this offer. The value of the money is significantly reduced, and it's better to secure some amount than risk getting nothing if I reject and Bob continues to make more favorable offers for himself."
