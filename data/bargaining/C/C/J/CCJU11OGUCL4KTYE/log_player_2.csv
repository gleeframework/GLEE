**Reasoning:** Alice is right, time is running out. However, she's clearly trying to pressure me.  I'm willing to budge a little more, but I'm not going to accept an offer where I get less than half, especially with the increasing inflation. I need to make a counteroffer that shows I'm willing to negotiate but won't be pushed around."
