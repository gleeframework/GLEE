"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not sure what the inflation rate will do to the value of money for Alice, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer, considering I'm taking the risk of the inflation rate potentially working against me in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still unsure about the inflation effect on Alice, and I think I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 55/45. I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation, but I'm still confident I can get a decent share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

With the inflation rate hitting me hard, I'm going to accept this 50/50 split. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing."
