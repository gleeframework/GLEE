"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point and Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, and I was initially offered $8,000, I would have received $6,400 in the first round if Bob had accepted. Now, with the inflation, I would have received $5,120 if I were to accept Bob's offer.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, and I was offered $5,120 in the previous round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to make a higher offer, but I still think you're being too greedy 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth even less for me now. If I were to accept Bob's offer, I would be getting $4,000, which is a significant reduction from the original $8,000 I was offered in the first round.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better one. I'll think about it for a moment...

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
