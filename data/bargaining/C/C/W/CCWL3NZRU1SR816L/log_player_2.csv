"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer gives you a good share considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, I believe I can do better considering the inflation will hit Alice harder than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle.  Inflation is going to hit us both, but this way we both get a decent share.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  This is a better deal than the last round for both of us, given the inflation. Let's be smart and take it. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still not ideal, and I believe I can get a better deal.  The inflation is impacting her more than me, so I'm going to see if she'll offer more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""We're getting closer to the deadline, so let's be reasonable. This offer gives you a fair share while also considering the inflation hitting us both. Let's end this game.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of the inflation.  Take this offer, it's the best you'll get. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still not what I want, and I think I can get a better deal.  I'm going to try one more time to get her to split it more evenly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we need to be practical. The clock is ticking, and both of us are losing money. This offer is a reasonable compromise given the inflation. Let's end this game and get a decent share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you're leaving me no choice.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it.  We're both losing out the longer this goes on. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  The inflation is hitting us both hard, and we're running out of time.  I'll accept her offer and move on."
