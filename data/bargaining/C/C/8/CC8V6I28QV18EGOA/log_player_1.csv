"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is worth less than it seems. I'll calculate the actual values:

Alice gain: $5,000 (no change)
Bob gain: $4,500 (10% less than $5,000)

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair meeting-in-the-middle approach, and I'd rather end the game now than risk losing more value with each passing round.
