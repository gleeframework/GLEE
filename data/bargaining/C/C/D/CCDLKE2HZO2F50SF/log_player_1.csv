"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 70 and you get 30. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get $50.  This way, there's no need for further rounds and we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think splitting it evenly is the best idea. I'd rather try to negotiate for more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50 is enough for me, considering the inflation. Can you offer me a bit more?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55, it's a fair compromise considering the inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's go with 60 for me, and 40 for you.  This feels like a fair compromise given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 60-40 split. I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""60 is a bit too high for me, considering the inflation. Can you meet me in the middle at 55?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger hit, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42.9,
  ""bob_gain"": 57.1,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 42.9, it's a bit more than before, but I think it's fair considering the inflation. Your turn!""
}
