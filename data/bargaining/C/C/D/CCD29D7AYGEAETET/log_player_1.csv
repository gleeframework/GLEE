"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 10% less, so my gain would be $250,000 * 0.9 = $225,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer.
