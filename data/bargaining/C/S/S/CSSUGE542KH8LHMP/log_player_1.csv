"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more even split. Let's be fair and keep this game going! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, my gain of $450,000 is actually $360,000 in real terms. And since Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 5% less, it's actually $522,500 in real terms.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more aggressive now. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm trying to increase my share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll bite!"
