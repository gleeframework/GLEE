"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game early. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a generous offer, it's worth seeing if Alice will make an even better deal in the next round, especially considering the inflation risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'd like to propose a more even split. Let's be fair and keep this game going!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to be more aggressive now. Will you accept? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm worried about the inflation impact and the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers.  This offer at least secures a decent portion of the money."
