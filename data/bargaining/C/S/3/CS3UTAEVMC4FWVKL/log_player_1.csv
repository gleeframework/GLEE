}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself, $900,000. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject this offer!"

I'm willing to accept this offer. With the money worth less and less with each round, I'd rather take the $200,000 than risk losing everything. It's not a great deal, but it's better than nothing!"
