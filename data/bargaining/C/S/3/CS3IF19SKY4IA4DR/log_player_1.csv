"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. We can discuss further if you'd like.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small portion, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time. You can't beat this offer! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, $2,000 is actually only worth $1,600 in real terms.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll think it over...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Considering the 20% decrease in value, $2,000 is now only worth $1,600, and $8,000 is worth $6,400.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer this time. Don't expect more! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Let's calculate the real value of the offer:

* My gain: $2,500 is worth 51.2% of the original $2,000, which is $1,024 in real terms.
* Bob's gain: $7,500 is worth 75% of the original $10,000, which is $7,500 in real terms.

Considering the reduced value of money, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, it's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.
