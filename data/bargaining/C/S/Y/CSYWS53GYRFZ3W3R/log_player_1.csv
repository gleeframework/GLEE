Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 200000

```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'll reject it for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The stakes are getting lower due to inflation! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, it looks like Bob is mirroring my previous offer from round 3, so I'll try to get a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The game is heating up! With the money's value decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering a slightly larger share to myself, but I hope it'll be enough to sway Bob into accepting."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of my potential gain! Considering the drastic reduction in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, the value of Bob's offer is still relatively high, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a tiny fraction of the original amount.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
