"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take $60 and give $40 to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'll offer $55 for myself and $45 for Bob.  This is a bit less than my initial offer, but it still seems like a fair deal considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is much worse for me than my offer in the last round, and with inflation, my money is worth much less. I'll try to push for a better deal again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $45, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm aware the inflation is hurting both of us, so I think this is a reasonable offer that gives us both a decent share."
