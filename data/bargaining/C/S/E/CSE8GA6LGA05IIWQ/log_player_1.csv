"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain and Bob would gain are:

* Alice gain: 450,000 (90% of 500,000)
* Bob gain: 450,000

Hmm... it's a 50-50 split, which is a pretty fair offer. I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
