"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 4:1 ratio in my favor, considering the diminishing value of money and the fact that I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share now to have a larger share later. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
