I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to secure a good deal early on. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm leaving a small amount for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Even though I'm getting less than I wanted initially, I'm losing 20% of the value of the money with each round. It's better to secure some value now rather than risk getting nothing in the end."
