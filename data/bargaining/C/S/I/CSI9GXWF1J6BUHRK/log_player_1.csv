"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a fair starting point, with a significant advantage for Alice, reflecting the higher inflation rate she faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose Alice gets $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a more balanced offer than the first round, taking into account the inflation rate. Since Bob's offer was far too low, I'm willing to give him a more significant share this time, but I need to secure at least 60% for myself due to my higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is lower than I would like, the inflation is becoming a major factor. Accepting this will at least secure me something, whereas rejecting it could lead to nothing at all."
