"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,750.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
