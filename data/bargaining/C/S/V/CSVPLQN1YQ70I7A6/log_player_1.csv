Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the only fair option left. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns for Bob:**  The value of the money for Bob is rapidly decreasing.  He's feeling the pressure to make a deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in a future round. Bob might be desperate enough to accept a less favorable deal in the next round, but there's also a chance he holds out for something closer to even. 
* **""Bird in Hand"" Principle:** It's often better to accept a reasonable offer than to risk getting nothing at all by holding out for an ideal outcome."
