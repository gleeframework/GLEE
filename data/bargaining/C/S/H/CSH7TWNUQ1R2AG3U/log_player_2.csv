"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to start the negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm hoping to take advantage of the inflation effect to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's time we flipped the script, Alice.  Since I'm taking a hit from inflation, I'm offering you a bit less.  Let's see if we can get this done before things get even tougher.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'm still losing out to inflation, I think it's best to accept this offer.  It's a better deal for me than round 1, and I'm not sure I can improve on it in the next round.  Let's end this negotiation and move on."
