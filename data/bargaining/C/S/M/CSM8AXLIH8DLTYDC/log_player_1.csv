Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and see if Bob is willing to accept a very small share.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to keep as much as possible, it's clear Bob is playing tough.  The 50/50 split is fair and with inflation, I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the future.  Accepting is the best choice here."
