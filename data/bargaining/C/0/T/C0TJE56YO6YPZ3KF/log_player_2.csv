"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split, Bob. 60/40 seems fair to me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, especially considering the inflation! I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 55/45 split. This gives you a bit more than Alice's offer, but still acknowledges your need for more money due to higher inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was tempting, Bob, but the inflation difference is significant. How about 56/44? 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is a good compromise considering the inflation. It's better than risking another round and potentially getting a worse deal."
