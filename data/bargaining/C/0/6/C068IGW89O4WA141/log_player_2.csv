Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation more than Bob, and her offers are slowly getting better for Bob. It's risky, but holding out for one more round might result in Alice making a final, desperate offer that's more favorable to Bob."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, or I'm going for the win on the next round.  This is your last chance!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to turn up the heat and apply pressure.  Alice needs to understand that Bob is serious and willing to push this to the later rounds where her share diminishes considerably. By offering a slight concession, it might be just enough to get Alice to agree, while still securing a favorable outcome for Bob."
