"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round.  I want to maximize my share while being aware that Bob has the power to reject and force a second round.  This offer leaves a decent amount for Bob, hopefully enough to make him accept, but if not, I can adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting a smaller share than I initially wanted, the inflation means my share is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.  Accepting now guarantees me a decent amount, and any further rounds risk losing even more of my share."
