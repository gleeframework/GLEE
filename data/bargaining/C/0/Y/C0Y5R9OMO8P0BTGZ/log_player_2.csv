Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down and get me to accept a less favorable deal. While the inflation is eating into the potential winnings, I still believe I can get a better outcome. Accepting now sets a bad precedent and signals I'm desperate."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be real, Alice.  This is the fairest we're going to get.  50/50.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming a serious issue. While I want a better than 50/50 split, it's time to acknowledge the diminishing returns. Offering a truly fair deal may be the best way to salvage a good portion of the money."
