Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get the same amount, and we can move on to more important things. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up a bit, but I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. While he's offering slightly more, the inflation is working significantly against me. It's worth holding out for a better deal, even if it means taking a risk in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is a serious offer, Bob.  It's time to settle this before we both lose out."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but not by much. I need to convey the urgency of the situation due to the inflation rapidly eroding my potential gains."
