"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $10,000. I'm keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's see if we can improve from here! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my initial $6,000 is now worth $5,700.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have $5,000 and Bob will have $5,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
