"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a 50/50 split. However, I'll also consider the inflation factor, so I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. In the first round, I rejected a 60/40 split, so I'll try to get a better deal now.

I'll offer a 55/45 split, which is a slight improvement from Alice's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, and it's now 19% less than the previous round, I'll adjust my offer to account for the increased inflation.

I'll offer a 58/42 split, which is a slight improvement from my previous rejection.
