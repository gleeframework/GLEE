"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big share in the first round, hoping to secure most of the money before inflation kicks in.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm not ready to settle for a 50/50 split yet. Even with inflation, I think I can still get a better deal. I'll see if I can get him to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm still going for a larger share, but I've adjusted my offer slightly to be more appealing to Bob, taking into account the inflation.  Let's see if he'll accept this time!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even though inflation is hitting hard, I'm still not willing to settle for a smaller share than Bob.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Inflation is starting to really bite, but I'm still trying to hold onto as much of the money as possible.  This offer is a compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to accept it than my previous offers."

This offer is getting really bad, but I'm not willing to give up so much yet.  I'm still hoping to negotiate a better deal.  I'll see if I can get him to budge in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Inflation is seriously impacting my share.  I'm making a concession here, but still trying to get a reasonable amount.  Hopefully Bob will see that I'm being realistic at this point."
