"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us going""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the money is worth less to me each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the value of the money for both of us.

In this round, I'll get $40, and Bob will get $60. Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is actually worth 80% of the original $60, which is $48. So, I'm effectively getting $40, and Bob is getting $48.

I'll accept this offer.
