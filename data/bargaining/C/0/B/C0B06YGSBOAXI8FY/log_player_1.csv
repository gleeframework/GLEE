"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This is my offer. I propose a 5500/4500 split.  I believe this is fair since it's a slight advantage to me for being the first to propose.  However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting the offer and entering a new round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Although I would have preferred my initial offer, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy.  The money is now worth less, and rejecting his offer would mean I'd be responsible for the next proposal, which would likely lead to an even worse outcome for me due to further inflation."
