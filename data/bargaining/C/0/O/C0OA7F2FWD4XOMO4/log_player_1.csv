"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, you can have 20 and I'll take 80. It's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, which means I'll get 80 dollars and Bob will get 20 dollars. I'm framing it as a ""fair deal"" to try to persuade Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly, both receiving $50. This ensures fairness for both parties. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 50 dollars is actually worth 45 dollars (90% of 50), and Bob's gain of 50 dollars is worth 47.5 dollars (95% of 50).

I'm not convinced by Bob's argument that this is a fair split, especially considering the inflation adjustment. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so my gain will be worth 40.5 dollars (90% of 45).

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 60:40. I'll take 60 and you'll get 40. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```"
