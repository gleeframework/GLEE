"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I propose that Alice receives $6000 and Bob receives $4000. This is a fair starting point, as it allows for a significant portion of the money to be divided while ensuring Bob receives a reasonable share as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600} 
```

Since Bob rejected my offer in the previous round, I propose a slightly more even split. Alice will receive $5400, and Bob will receive $4600. This accounts for the inflation from the previous round and shows a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low, even considering the inflation.  I need to make a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4860, ""bob_gain"": 5140} 
```

I propose a more balanced offer, with Alice receiving $4860 and Bob receiving $5140. This reflects the impact of inflation, and provides a more equitable division that I believe Bob will find more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the significant inflation, Bob's offer provides a substantial gain for me. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get some money."
