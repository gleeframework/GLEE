"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing.  My offer is still reasonable.  Let's close this deal.""

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more this time, but I'm still holding out for a more even split. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting worse for him with each round due to inflation, and he's finally willing to give me a larger share. However, I'm aiming higher. I'll hold out a bit longer and see if I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time.  This is a good deal for both of us, considering the circumstances. Take it while you can!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting close to the end.  This is my final offer.  It's the best I can do, but I'm still hoping for a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Although time is running out, Bob's offer is worse than what he offered in Round 2! He clearly feels the pressure of inflation. I need to hold strong, as it's likely he will be more desperate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm throwing you a lifeline here. This is the same offer I made in Round 1. Let's be smart and end this before inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Repeating my Round 1 offer might seem counterintuitive, but it emphasizes the impact of inflation on Bob. He's now getting a significantly worse deal than what was originally on the table. This might be enough to make him reconsider and accept before he loses even more."
