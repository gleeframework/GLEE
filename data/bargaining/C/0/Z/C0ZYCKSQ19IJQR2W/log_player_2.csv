Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go up to 65 for myself, but I think it's only fair that we split the remaining amount evenly. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. I need to make up for the inflation.  I'll take 55, you take 45.  Final offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Look, the inflation is hurting both of us.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  We're both losing money with each round.  We're better off just settling. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's painful to accept, but at this point, the inflation is killing any potential future gains for Bob. Taking the even split, even though it's heavily in Alice's favor due to the inflation mechanic, is the best option remaining."
