Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose. Let's split the difference of your offer to ensure we both benefit from closing the deal this round.

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer. The new value of the money is $8000 for me and $9600 for Bob in the original scale, which is not good enough. It's my turn now. I'll make a new offer.
