"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 2500 x 0.95 = 2375
Bob gain: 7500 x 0.95 = 7125

I'm not happy with the large disparity in the proposed split. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. Let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, but I'll take a slight edge. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 14.26% inflation:

Original amount: $10,000
Inflation rate: 1 - 0.9426 = 0.0574 (or 5.74%)
New amount: $10,000 x 0.9426 = $9,426

Alice gain: 5000 x 0.9426 = 4703
Bob gain: 5000 x 0.9426 = 4703

The proposed split is now 50-50, which is a fair compromise. I'll accept this offer.
