"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous offer considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, the new values are:

Alice's gain: 300,000 * 0.8 = 240,000
Bob's gain: 700,000 * 0.9 = 630,000

My offer is not as generous as Bob's, so I'll consider his offer. I think this is a fair compromise, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll try to get a bit more, Bob. Let's see what you can do!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the new values are:

Alice's gain: 240,000 * 0.8 = 192,000
Bob's gain: 630,000 * 0.9 = 567,000

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, Bob. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my goal, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation factor:

Alice's gain: 192,000 * 0.52 = 99,840 (not 100,000, but close enough)
Bob's gain: 567,000 * 0.7273 = 413,151.9 (not 900,000, but close enough)

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm not getting a great deal, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced, Bob. I want a better deal!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the new values are:

Alice's gain: 99,840 * 0.8 = 79,872
Bob's gain: 413,151.9 * 0.9 = 371,536.71

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60000,
  ""bob_gain"": 940000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. Take this and let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very large share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finally conclude the game."
