I propose a 90/10 split, favoring me slightly. I want to start with a fair but decisive offer to avoid unnecessary rounds and potential loss due to inflation."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm lowering my share to 60, as the inflation impact is becoming increasingly significant. While this is a substantial reduction, it's still a better outcome than risking further rounds and potentially losing more due to inflation."

``` 
While Bob's offer is getting better for me, I'm still hopeful that I can secure a better share. Given the significant impact of inflation, I believe that I can still negotiate a more favorable outcome for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm proposing a 50/50 split to avoid risking getting nothing.  The inflation is having a huge impact, and I'm willing to compromise to secure some of the money rather than risking getting nothing at all."
