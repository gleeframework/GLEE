"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60-40 in my favor, as I'm the one making the first offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair starting point and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 70-30 is a good deal for me, especially considering I was willing to start with a 60-40 split. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, it's still early in the game""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
