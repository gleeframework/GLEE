Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  Since the money loses value for me with each round, it makes sense to get a larger share now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is becoming a real problem. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
