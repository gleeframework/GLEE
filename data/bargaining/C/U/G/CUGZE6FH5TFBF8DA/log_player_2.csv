**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value is decreasing with each round. By continuing to reject her offers, I'm hoping she'll realize we both lose if this goes on much longer. I'm willing to accept a less favorable split as the rounds progress, but not this far off."
