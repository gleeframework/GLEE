"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $6,000 and Bob receiving $4,000. I've included a message to Bob, suggesting that this is a fair split. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  Let's split the difference from your offer, slightly in my favor to account for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer, as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The fact that Bob is trying to account for inflation by offering a split slightly in his favor makes me think he's willing to negotiate further.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money is now worth 10% less than the original amount, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll propose a 55-45 split, with me receiving $5,500 and Bob receiving $4,500. My message to Bob will emphasize that we should come to an agreement soon to minimize the impact of inflation.
