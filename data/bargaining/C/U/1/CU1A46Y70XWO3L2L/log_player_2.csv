"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. It's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round, since inflation could affect her proposal more than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since we're both aware of inflation, I'm betting that Alice will accept this offer rather than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is better than the one I rejected in round 2, even considering inflation. I'm going to accept this offer."
