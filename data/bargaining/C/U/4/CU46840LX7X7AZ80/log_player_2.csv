"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have nothing to lose by waiting. Meanwhile, the pressure of inflation is on Alice, as the money loses value for her with each passing round. This dynamic gives me a strategic advantage in negotiations, as Alice is incentivized to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Let's see what she offers next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make an offer that slightly favors me, considering the pressure of inflation on Alice. Since the money loses value for her, she might be more inclined to accept a less favorable offer as the rounds progress.

# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Given that the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I'm in a stronger negotiating position. Alice's offer of a 52-48 split is closer to what I'm looking for, but I think I can push for an even better split in the next rounds. The pressure of inflation on Alice's side means she's likely to become more flexible with her offers as the game progresses. Let's see how she reacts in the next round."

With the money losing over a third of its value for her, she's under significant pressure to reach an agreement.
