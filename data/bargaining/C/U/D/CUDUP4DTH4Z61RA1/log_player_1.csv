"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the decreased value. However, Bob's offer is not bad, and it's a significant improvement from the 50-50 split I initially proposed.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
