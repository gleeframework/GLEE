"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't fool me with your even split! I'll take 60, you get 40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'll try to make a counteroffer that will give me a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""You're too greedy, Bob! I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think you're getting away with everything!""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, trying to make a slightly better offer than Bob's initial 40-60 split. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice! I'll give you a 'generous' offer, but don't expect any more! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more and more aggressive!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. The 35-65 split is still too skewed in his favor, and I'm not willing to give up that much. I'll try to make another counteroffer to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 42, ""bob_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""You're not getting away with all the money, Bob! I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think you're getting off that easy!""}

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, trying to get a bit closer to a more even split. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
