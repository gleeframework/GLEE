"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to share some.  Accept this and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 100,000$ gain is tempting, it's worth risking a round to see if I can get a better deal. With each round, Alice's offer will be worth less and less to her, potentially giving me more leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I think a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get the most out of this deal.""}
