I'm going to start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given I'm the one making the initial offer. I'll be curious to see if Bob accepts or if he wants to counter-propose!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even considering the inflation. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic shift in the split. I'll counter-propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to reflect the inflation, but still keeping a larger share for myself.  I believe 70/30 is a fair split considering I'm the one proposing, and it's better than Bob's last offer. Let's see if this is acceptable to him."
