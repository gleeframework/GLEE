"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
Let's see if Bob takes this offer. If not, we'll adjust for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred to get more, accepting this offer ensures I get a substantial portion of the money.  It's better than risking getting nothing due to further inflation."
