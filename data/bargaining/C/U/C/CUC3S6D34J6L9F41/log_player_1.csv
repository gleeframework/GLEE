"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, with a message encouraging fairness in the division. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for the decreasing value of the money. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer since the division seems unfair given the inflation rates, and the message doesn't justify the significant difference in our gains. Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to account for the decreasing value of money due to inflation. I'm willing to take a bit less than before to make the deal more appealing to Bob, while also ensuring I get a fair share. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer considering the significant inflation we both face. Let's end this before it loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, Bob's offer seems relatively fair at this point. Continuing the game risks further devaluation, so accepting this offer appears to be the best option."
