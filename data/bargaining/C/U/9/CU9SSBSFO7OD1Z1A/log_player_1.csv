"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, but I'm not going to fall for that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think I'm generous? You're trying to take the lion's share!""
}
```

I'll stick to my initial proposal and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not that much! You're still getting a good deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping some for myself."
