I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am aware of the inflation rates. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential loss Bob faces with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 80/20, considering Bob's rejection of my previous offer.  However, with inflation at play, I still believe this is a fair split given the potential loss both of us face in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is seriously cutting into my potential gains.  This is a decent split, considering the circumstances."
