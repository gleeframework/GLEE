Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my initial offer is heavily skewed in my favor.  I understand this might seem unfair at first glance. However, consider the rapid depreciation of the money. It's in both our best interests to settle this quickly. What benefits us both a little now, will be meaningless later. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
