Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer to Alice, taking into account the inflation factor. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I've decided to propose a division that is slightly more favorable to me. I'm offering Alice $45, while I take $55. I've also included a message explaining my reasoning, hoping that Alice will understand my perspective and accept the offer. Let's see how Alice responds!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept a deal that's significantly less than my initial offer.  Let's split the difference. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Alice's offer from round 3. Although she's willing to compromise, I still think I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor. The money is worth 9.75% less for me now, and 36% less for Alice. I'm hoping that in the next round, I can propose a division that takes into account the decreasing value of the money and get a more favorable outcome. Let's proceed to the next round!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the significant inflation impact on your end, I think this is a fair adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making another offer to Alice. Given that the money is worth 36% less for her than in the first round, I believe she'll be more inclined to accept a slightly less favorable deal. I'm proposing that I take $58, while Alice gets $42. I've included a message explaining my reasoning, highlighting the significant impact of inflation on her end. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a fair adjustment and accept the offer. Let's see how she responds!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's just split it evenly and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer from round 5. Given the significant impact of inflation on both of us, I think splitting the money evenly is a reasonable decision. The money is now worth 18.55% less for me and 59.04% less for Alice than in the first round. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision to minimize further losses. Let's end the game here and take the 50-50 split.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm glad we could come to an agreement and split the money evenly. It was a good game, and I'm happy with the outcome!"
