"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the 5% inflation, I'm willing to take a risk to potentially get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the inflation that affects both of us. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I believe a 45-55 split is a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I think this is a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we both lose with each round.  I'm being generous, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that Alice's gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, I think this offer is reasonable. The money I gain is worth 9.75% less, but I'm still getting a significant amount. Since Alice claims this is her final offer, I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially losing more value. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
