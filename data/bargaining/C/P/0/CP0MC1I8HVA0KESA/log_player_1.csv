"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

This offer gives me $70 and Bob $30, which is a fair split in my opinion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but we can both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my wallet!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can live with it. I'll accept his proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
