Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

At this point, the inflation is really starting to hurt both of us, but it's hurting Alice more. While I'd prefer a better split, accepting Alice's offer now will guarantee me a reasonable amount, even with the inflation. Waiting any longer is too risky, as the value will continue to decrease, and Alice's offers might get even worse for me.
