Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split of the remaining amount. This ensures fairness and prevents either side from feeling exploited by the diminishing value of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
