"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This is a generous offer, as it's likely Bob will be more concerned about inflation than I am in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's a better split for me than my previous offer, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm confident that I can convince Bob to accept a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a 7000/3000 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer, considering Bob's offer in the previous round.  I think he'll realize that he's not getting a better deal by rejecting this offer, and I can take advantage of the inflation that's hitting him harder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. Even though I'd prefer more money, I know that Bob is being hit hard by inflation. This offer guarantees me a decent share of the money, and I don't want to risk further rounds where the inflation could significantly reduce my gain."
