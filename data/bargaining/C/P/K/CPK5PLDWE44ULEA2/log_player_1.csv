"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45. Since the money loses value for you each round, it's better to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand the situation with inflation, but my previous offer was already generous. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation on your gains, I'm willing to offer 58/42. The longer we wait, the less you'll actually receive. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is using the threat of inflation to push for a larger share. While it's true my potential gains are decreasing, accepting 42% is a significant loss. I need to hold firm and try to negotiate a better split, aiming for at least 45%."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement.  Let's make it simple: a 50/50 split. This ensures we both benefit and avoids further losses from inflation.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to offer a 60/40 split. This is a fair adjustment considering the rounds that have passed. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now trying to take advantage of the situation by reversing the initial offer, even though he knows it's heavily skewed in his favor due to inflation. Accepting 40% now would be a significant loss compared to my previous offer of 50/50. I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to risk it going to later rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 48,
""bob_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but I need you to meet me halfway. This offer acknowledges the inflation factor while ensuring we both walk away with something reasonable.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significantly unfair deal.  Dropping my ask slightly to 48% shows flexibility and puts the pressure on Bob to accept a reasonable offer before the effects of inflation worsen the situation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm adjusting my offer to 62/38. Each round further reduces the value of the money for you, making this a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting greedier, and his latest offer is unacceptable. While the effects of inflation are becoming more severe, accepting 38% would be a significant loss, especially after offering a 50/50 split previously. I need to hold firm and show Bob that I'm prepared to walk away with nothing if he doesn't offer a more equitable deal.  The next few rounds will be crucial for pushing him towards a more reasonable split."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 45,
""bob_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a 55/45 split - take it or leave it.  This is my final offer.  If you reject it, I'm prepared to let the remaining rounds expire and we both get nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time for a final, firm stance.  This offer is a concession, but it sets a clear boundary.  By offering 45% and stating it's my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. He now faces a choice: accept a still advantageous deal or risk getting nothing at all.  The threat of a ""walk-away"" can be very effective in these situations."
