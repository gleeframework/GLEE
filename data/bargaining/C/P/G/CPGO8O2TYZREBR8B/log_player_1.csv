"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and I'll take $5,500. I've attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to convey that my offer is reasonable and close to an equal split, considering that I'm only taking a slightly larger share. I hope Bob finds this acceptable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""
}
```

I've taken into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's money is worth 20% less than initially, so I've adjusted my offer to give him a bit less than before. I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation affects me more, I need more to compensate 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation hurts me too""
}
```

I've increased my share slightly, considering that the inflation is affecting both of us, but Bob's money is losing value faster. I'm trying to find a balance between our losses and still make the offer reasonable."
