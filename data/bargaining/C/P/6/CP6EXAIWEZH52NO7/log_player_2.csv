Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's a reasonable split considering the inflation.  Let's close this out now. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and Bob's bargaining position is weakening faster than Alice's due to the higher inflation rate he faces. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what he can likely get in later rounds. If he rejects this, Alice will likely lowball him in a future offer, knowing he's desperate to avoid getting $0."
