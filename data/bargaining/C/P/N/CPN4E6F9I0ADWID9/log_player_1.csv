"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to grab most of the money on the first round. If Bob rejects, I'll have to be more reasonable in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to take the 500,000 now. While I lose a lot of my potential gain, it's better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds due to inflation."
