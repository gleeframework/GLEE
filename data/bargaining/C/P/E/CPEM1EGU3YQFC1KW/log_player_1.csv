"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Take 10, I'll take 90.""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly, Alice. $50 for me and $50 for you. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll receive $60, but it's worth only 80% of the original amount, so it's actually worth $48.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
