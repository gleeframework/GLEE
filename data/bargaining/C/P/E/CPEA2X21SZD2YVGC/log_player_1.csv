"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives you a large share, but it's still a generous offer to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for room to adjust if Bob rejects the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair given the inflation and limited rounds.  Accepting ensures I get something, unlike risking a lower offer or getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
