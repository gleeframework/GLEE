"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $20 is actually worth $19 (95% of $20).

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer was 60-40. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle this time, let's try 40-60.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a more even split than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still low, I'll give you a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $15 is actually worth $12.83 (86.73% of $15).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, considering the decreasing value of money. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, let's try 30-70.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 30-70 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable offer considering the inflation."
