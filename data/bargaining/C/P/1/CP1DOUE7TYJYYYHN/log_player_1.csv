"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the initial $10,000. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $2,850.

I'm not too happy with Bob's offer, as it's quite skewed towards his favor. I think I can do better than that.

```

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than last round.""
