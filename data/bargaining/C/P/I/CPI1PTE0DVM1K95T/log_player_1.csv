Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my first offer. I'm taking the lion's share, but giving Bob a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept it.  Since we're both starting out, I figure it's better to be greedy early on.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  It's not ideal, but given the inflation, it's the best I can expect.  Better to split it 50/50 now than risk getting a worse deal later."
