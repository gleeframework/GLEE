"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a straightforward and fair starting point."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you get 40, a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, but I don't know the exact amount of money he thinks he's getting, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Considering the offer is 60 for Bob and 40 for me, I think he might be trying to take a larger share. However, I'm not sure if he's accounting for the inflation correctly.

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
