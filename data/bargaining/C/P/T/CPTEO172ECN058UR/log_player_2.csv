"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly skewed, split. I'm confident we can find a better solution in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is a decent start, it's highly likely that I can get a better deal in future rounds considering the inflation rate is more severe for Alice.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I believe this split is more fair, considering the inflation rate will affect your share more heavily than mine.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to take a smaller share now, but I believe this will lead to a more stable outcome for both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This offer is much better than my previous proposal and, with the inflation rate, is likely to be the best I can get. It's a fair compromise, and it ensures that I get a substantial amount of the money. Accepting this ensures that I get a decent share and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
