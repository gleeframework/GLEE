"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a fair and straightforward starting offer. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than the previous round, and the inflation is starting to bite into my potential gains. I'm not willing to accept this yet. I'll see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm going to try to compromise a bit by offering Bob slightly more than the previous round, but still aiming for a fairer split. Since I'm losing more to inflation than Bob, I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfair, and the inflation is making this a very risky game. I need to hold out for a better deal. I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, especially with the money losing value so quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher share than my previous offer. With the rapid inflation, I need to be more flexible to avoid losing out completely. However, I'm still aiming for a split that's relatively close to even."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is becoming increasingly unacceptable.  While I recognize the pressure from inflation, Bob's offer is now significantly skewed in his favor. I'm determined to hold out for a fairer division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}
```

Inflation is becoming a major issue, and I need to compromise. This offer concedes a bit more to Bob, but I'm still trying to secure a reasonable share. I believe this demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also protecting myself from losing too much to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to justify accepting such a low share. I'm not willing to accept this deal. The risk of getting nothing at all is significant, but I believe holding out for a fairer offer is still the best course of action."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000}
```

I'm making one last attempt to secure a reasonable share before the inflation completely erodes my potential gain. This offer gives Bob a significant share, but it's the highest I'm willing to go at this point. It's a gamble, but with the risk of getting nothing, I'm hoping Bob will recognize the urgency of the situation and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible deal. While the risk of getting nothing is high, I can't justify accepting such a lopsided split, especially considering the rapid devaluation of the money. I'll try to hold out for a better offer, even if the odds are against me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 2500, ""bob_gain"": 7500}
```

Time is running out and the inflation is devastating. I need to make a significant concession to get anything at all. This offer gives Bob a very favorable share, but it's my final attempt at securing a deal before we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a very difficult decision, as it's a highly unfavorable offer.  However, with only one round left, the risk of getting nothing at all is too great.  While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, even a small gain is better than nothing."
