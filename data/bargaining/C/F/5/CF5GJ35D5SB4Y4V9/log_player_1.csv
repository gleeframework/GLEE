I'm going for a very greedy opening offer. I figure Bob will reject this, but it establishes my position and starts the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. It's just as unfair as my initial offer, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable proposal, and I believe Bob will accept it."
