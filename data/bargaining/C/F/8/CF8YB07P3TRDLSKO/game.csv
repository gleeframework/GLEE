7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to share a fair portion while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds. Let's end the game.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
