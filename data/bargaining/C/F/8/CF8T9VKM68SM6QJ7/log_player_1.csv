"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob receives 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, 7K for me, 3K for you! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the 3000 I would receive is actually equivalent to 2400 in the first round. Bob, on the other hand, would still get 7000, which is the same as in the first round.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, 45-55 split, let's try again!""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me receiving 4500 and Bob receiving 5500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking the lead! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's trying to squeeze me dry!

Considering the inflation, the 2000 I would receive is actually equivalent to 1664 in the first round, which is a pretty paltry sum. Bob, on the other hand, would still get 8000, which is a significant chunk of the total amount.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 3200, ""bob_gain"": 6800, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 32-68 split, a compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, with me receiving 3200 and Bob receiving 6800."
