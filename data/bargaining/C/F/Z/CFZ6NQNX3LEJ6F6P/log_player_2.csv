Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for me, Bob! I'll make a better offer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up some more to get this settled. How about 60/40 in my favor?  Let's find a compromise before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still not a good deal for me, Bob.  The inflation is hurting me more each round, but I need to hold out for a better split."
