"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with me getting $800,000 and Bob getting $200,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair split. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better offer, especially since the money is decreasing in value over time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me, but still a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still a reasonable offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
