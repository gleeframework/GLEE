"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept to avoid the potential for inflation.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something. With inflation, the next round might be even worse."
