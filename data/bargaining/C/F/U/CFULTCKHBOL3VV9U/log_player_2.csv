Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a better balance.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Alice $550,000 and keep $450,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's try to find a better balance."" This offer takes into account the fact that the money is worth less with each passing round, so I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Alice's offer from round 3. Although the money is worth less with each passing round, I believe I can still get a better deal. Alice's message says it's her final offer, but I'm willing to take the risk and make another proposal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Come on, let's split it fairly.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Alice $520,000 and keep $480,000 for myself, with the message ""Come on, let's split it fairly."" Considering the inflation, I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. The money is worth even less now, so I'm hoping Alice will see the sense in accepting this offer.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
