"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of $3,000, I'd be better off taking it than risking a worse offer in the next round. Plus, it's still a significant amount of money, even with the 5% reduction.

I accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
