"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the new values are:

* My gain: $4,500 (which is 5% less than $6,000)
* Bob's gain: $4,500 (which is 10% less than $5,000)

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the original offer I made was a 60-40 split, and now Bob is offering a 50-50 split, but with less value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial 60-40 split I proposed. Let's compromise!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
