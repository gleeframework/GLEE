"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I'm starting with a relatively fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to make a stronger offer 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I was willing to start with a 60-40 split, and Bob's offer is much more lopsided. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more equal division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation."
