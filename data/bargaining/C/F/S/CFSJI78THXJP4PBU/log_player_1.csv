"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $700,000 is still a significant amount, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob $800,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. Let's see if he accepts!"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get closer to the original 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with giving him $600,000.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, $400,000 is a decent amount, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob the majority of the money.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, Alice. This is my best offer yet 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a strong push for the majority of the money. However, with inflation, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, so $300,000 is a decent amount.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob $700,000, but I'm also not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
