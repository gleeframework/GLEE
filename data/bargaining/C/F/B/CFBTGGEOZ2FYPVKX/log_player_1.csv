"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but also hinting that I'm willing to take the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this round, but I'm still hoping for a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer because it's still too lopsided in Bob's favor. I'm losing more value due to inflation, and I'm not getting a fair share of the remaining money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground and show that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still looking for a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway this time, but I'm still not giving up on getting more! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting this offer because it's a 50/50 split, which is a significant improvement from previous offers. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to take the risk and accept this offer to avoid going into the next round."
