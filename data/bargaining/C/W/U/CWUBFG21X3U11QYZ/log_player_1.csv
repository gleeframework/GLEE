"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said fair split, so I'll give you a slightly more generous offer. Will you accept? 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I appreciate the slightly more generous offer, but I'm still not satisfied with the split. I was hoping for a more equal split, considering the initial proposal was already a 60:40 split. I'd like to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the initial proposal was already 60:40""}

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, where I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, you did propose 60:40, but I'm not going to give you an even larger share. Meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise, considering the initial proposal was already 60:40. Meeting in the middle at 52:48 seems like a fair split, especially given the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
