"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

In the first round, I was offered $6,000, which was worth $6,000. Now, in the second round, $6,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $5,700.

Bob's offer in the second round is $5,500 for him and $4,500 for me. Since $4,500 is 78.95% of the original $5,700, I'll accept this offer.
