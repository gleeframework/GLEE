I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, as I'm prioritizing getting the deal done in the first round. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more fair than my initial proposal, but it's still not ideal for me.  I'm confident I can do better.  I'll reject and see what he proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my share a bit, but still offering a significant amount to Bob.  The inflation is starting to take its toll, so I need to be more assertive.  This offer is still fair, but it gives me a better starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard now, and I'm worried about getting nothing at all. Bob's offer is still less than what I want, but it's the most I can expect at this point. I'll accept and hope I can get a better deal in the future."
