Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round. I'm proposing a compromise: I get $5500, you get $4500. It's better than what we'll have in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
