"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a fairly aggressive offer, but I'm hoping that Bob will accept it in the first round to avoid the potential for inflation to impact my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation rate makes it risky to continue. This offer is still a decent gain, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round."
