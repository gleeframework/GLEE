"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what I can get!  I want to try to get more than 400,000."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, and since I have the advantage of proposing first this round, I'm going to try to get a slightly better deal than Alice offered."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible offer!  Even with the inflation, 300,000 is way too low.  I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm going to propose a 40/60 split again. While Alice offered a worse deal in round 3, I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I want to see if she's willing to budge. The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to secure a better deal for myself soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is getting greedy!  250,000 is way too low, even with the inflation. I'm going to keep rejecting and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 350000, ""alice_gain"": 650000}
```

I'm going to offer a 35/65 split.  This is a more aggressive offer than the previous rounds, but Alice is clearly not interested in a fair split.  I need to start pushing for a better deal before the inflation makes it impossible to get anything worthwhile."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is being extremely unreasonable. 200,000 is a pittance at this point, and I'm not going to give up without a fight. I need to come up with a more aggressive strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm going to stick with the 40/60 split again.  It's a fair compromise, and while I'd love to get more, I need to start thinking about the time limit. With only 4 rounds left, I need to secure a deal soon.  I'm hoping that Alice will recognize this and be more reasonable with her offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is getting increasingly unreasonable.  I'm not going to accept such a low offer, even though the inflation is making it harder to get a fair deal.  I need to come up with a strategy to make sure I don't end up with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to offer a 45/55 split. I need to secure a deal, and while I'd love to get more, I'm worried about the remaining rounds. This is a slightly more aggressive offer than the last round, and hopefully Alice will see that it's in her best interest to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is being incredibly stubborn.  This offer is terrible, and I'm not giving up without a fight.  I need to come up with a strategy to secure at least some money before the timer runs out!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

This is my final offer.  We're both running out of time and the inflation is brutal.  A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome at this point, and I'm hoping Alice realizes that this is the best we can both do."
