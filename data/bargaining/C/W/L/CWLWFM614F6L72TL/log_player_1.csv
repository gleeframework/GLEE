"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game's conditions. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" aims to appeal to Bob's rational side, implying that this offer is fair and that prolonging the game would only lead to unnecessary losses for both parties due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob's offer gives me 40% of the money, which is less than what I initially offered him, and considering that the value of the money remains the same for me but decreases for Bob with each round, I have an incentive to hold out for a better deal. Therefore, I will reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering that the value of the money for Bob decreases with each round and I've already offered a fairly generous split in the first round, my next offer will slightly decrease Bob's share, reflecting the decreased value of the money for him and aiming to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both parties.\n{""alice_gain"": 620000, ""bob_gain"": 380000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer gives Bob slightly less than before, adjusting for the decreased value of the money for him, and includes a message that emphasizes the fairness of the offer under the current conditions, encouraging Bob to accept and end the game."
