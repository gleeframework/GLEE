"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, the total is now $9,000.

Here's my offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less after the second round, the total is now $7,200.
