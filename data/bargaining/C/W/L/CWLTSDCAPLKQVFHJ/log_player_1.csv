"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
