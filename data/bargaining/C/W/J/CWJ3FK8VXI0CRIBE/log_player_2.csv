Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. We've both lost money due to inflation, so I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. If we keep going back and forth, we'll both end up with less. Let's call it a draw. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
