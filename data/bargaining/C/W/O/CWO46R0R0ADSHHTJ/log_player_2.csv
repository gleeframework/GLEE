**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, and a classic illustration of the time pressure involved in negotiation.  Here's why I'm finally accepting:

* **Rapid Devaluation:**  The money is losing value quickly. Waiting any longer could result in an even worse outcome for me, even if Alice were to make a slightly better offer.
* **Uncertain Future:** There's no guarantee Alice will increase her offer in subsequent rounds. She may be entrenched in her position.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While not ideal, 400,000 is still a significant sum. Rejecting means risking walking away with nothing. 

It's painful to concede, but the risk of getting a worse outcome is too high at this point."
