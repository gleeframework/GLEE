"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate too hard!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rate!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, as I think I deserve a more equal share, especially since my gains are not affected by inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share to account for the inflation affecting your gains.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself to reflect the difference in inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is taking a big hit!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this offer is a good compromise, considering the inflation rates. I'm willing to accept a 40/60 split, which is closer to what I initially proposed, but still takes into account the effects of inflation on Bob's gains. Let's finalize the deal!"
