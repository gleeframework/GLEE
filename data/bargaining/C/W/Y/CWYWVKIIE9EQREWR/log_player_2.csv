Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have accepted my previous offers 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  The longer this goes on, the less I get even if I win a larger percentage in the end.  Alice is clearly playing hardball and knows the inflation is hurting me."
