"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can discuss further if you want to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too generous, I'll try to get a better deal.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the reduced value of the money. Let's meet in the middle.""
}

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less for me, I'm getting desperate to get a decent share. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a good compromise, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""It's a fair split, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'm getting worried about the inflation.""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get, but I'm still a bit uncertain."
