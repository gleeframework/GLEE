30.0,70.0,My turn! How about I take a bit more this time?  Think of it as an early bird bonus.  It only goes downhill from here with the inflation.,Bob,2,

40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not happy with your proposal.  Let's find a compromise closer to a 50/50 split.  We both have to be happy to get anything out of this deal.",Alice,3,

32.0,68.0,"Okay, let's try this again.  I'm happy to compromise, but the clock is ticking and that inflation is no joke for me. This offer gives me a little more breathing room.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
35.0,65.0,"I understand your point about the inflation, but I'm still not comfortable with such a large difference. Let's meet in the middle. This offer gives you a good deal, while still leaving me with something substantial.",Alice,5,
