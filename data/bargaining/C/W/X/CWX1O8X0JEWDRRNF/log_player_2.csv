Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand the money is devaluing for you, but your offer was a bit too much in your favor. This offer is a compromise, slightly closer to my previous proposal. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
