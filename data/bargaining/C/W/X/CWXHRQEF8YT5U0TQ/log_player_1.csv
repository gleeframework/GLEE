"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the original $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $200,000. The message is a friendly reminder that I'm willing to make a generous offer to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $500,000 (not $500,000, since that's 90% of $555,555.56)
* Bob gain: $500,000

Since the money is now worth less, I'd like to adjust the offer to reflect that. However, I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.
