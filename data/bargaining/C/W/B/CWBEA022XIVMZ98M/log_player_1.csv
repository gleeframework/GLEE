Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk in the first round, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of losing money in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While I could try to get more in the next round, Bob's offer is fair and I don't want to risk losing any money due to inflation."
