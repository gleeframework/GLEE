This is a good time to accept. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less money there is to be had for both of you. Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a decent amount.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in later rounds is risky. Bob might not propose a better deal, and the value of the money will continue to decrease. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair, and Bob has signaled he's willing to accept this."
