"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split seems like the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's proposal, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, especially since we're running out of rounds. I'm willing to accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
