"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game, which seems like a reasonable and fair way to begin. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can't beat this offer! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the lead!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to be cautious.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed towards you, Bob!""
}
```

Your turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect in mind, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not that much!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to Bob, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to squeeze out a better deal, stay patient! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my expectations. The money I gain is worth 27.1% less, and Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, so I'll need to be even more cautious.

However, this offer is similar to the previous one, and I'm not sure if I should wait for a better deal or accept this one. I'll choose to reject it and try to negotiate further.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not much of a squeeze, Bob!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect continuing to erode the value of money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of both our gains. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but don't expect any more!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to Bob, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll make one more push, let's see if you'll crack! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a final push!

Considering the significant inflation effect, I'll have to be very cautious. The money I gain is worth 40.95% less, and Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less, which means the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

However, this offer is still relatively close to the original 50/50 split, and I don't want to risk waiting for an even worse deal. I'll choose to accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, you got me, Bob!""
}
```"
