"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
