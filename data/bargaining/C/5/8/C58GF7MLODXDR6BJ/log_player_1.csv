"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it so we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think we should both get closer to a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this offer is good enough, considering the reduced value of the money. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split""
}
```

I'm trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, as Bob suggested, but I'm still a bit hesitant to give up the extra $100."
