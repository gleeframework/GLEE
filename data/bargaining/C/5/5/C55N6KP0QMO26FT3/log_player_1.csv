Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for a 60/40 split in my favor, hoping to secure a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is fair and ensures we both receive a substantial amount of money.  Given the inflation, I don't want to risk further rounds and potentially get a worse deal."
