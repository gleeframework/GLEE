Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get more if we're a bit more flexible. Let's try a 55/45 split, that way we both get a good chunk of the money before the inflation hits hard! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
