"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority and you can take the rest.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split would be fairer. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Since Bob is willing to give me more, I'll accept this offer.
