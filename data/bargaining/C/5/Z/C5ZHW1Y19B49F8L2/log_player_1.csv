"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I'm framing it as a fair starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have had more in the first round, now it's my turn to take the lead. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

I'll have to think carefully about this...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think he's being too aggressive, and I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation that has occurred so far. Since the money I gain is worth 80% of its original value, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of again!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, giving me $480,000 and Bob $520,000. I'm trying to be more aggressive this time to counter Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the best deal again, Alice. I'm not afraid to walk away. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make me feel like I'm not getting a good deal, but I need to think about the actual numbers.

Considering the inflation, the $200,000 I'd get in this round is actually worth even less than what I got in the previous round, adjusted for inflation. I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round, but I'll have to think carefully about how to adjust for the increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 68.8% inflation that has occurred so far (80% * 85.7%). I'll aim to get a significant portion of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a large share, but I'm not going to give up yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, giving me $320,000 and Bob $680,000. I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, considering the significant inflation that has occurred."
