"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I want to keep most of the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob getting 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a fair split, but I'm not sure I'm willing to give you all the power in the next round if we don't agree now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'd be getting $720,000 (80% of $900,000).

I'd like to accept Bob's offer, as it's a 50-50 split, which is more favorable to me than my initial offer. I'd rather take this deal and avoid the risk of Bob making a worse offer in the next round.
