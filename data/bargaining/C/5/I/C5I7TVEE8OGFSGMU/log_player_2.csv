Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think I deserve the larger share 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering slightly more, the effects of inflation are starting to hurt.  It's better to hold out for a better deal for a few more rounds, aiming for something closer to even or a slight advantage for me.  The longer this goes on, the worse any offer below 50% becomes for me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000,

""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the deadline.  I'm offering a very reasonable split - almost down the middle. Let's settle this now and both walk away with something substantial.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit more, but I'm not going below this. Time pressure is on you, Bob 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is hurting, but Alice is clearly trying to use the time pressure against me.  While 440,000 is a significant amount of money, it's a poor deal relative to the starting point, especially with 5 more rounds left. I need to show I'm willing to risk it going to the wire for a better split."
