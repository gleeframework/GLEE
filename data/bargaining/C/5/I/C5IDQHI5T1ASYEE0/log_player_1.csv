Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's split it evenly and avoid further risk. This is the fairest way to go forward. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Each round that passes significantly erodes the potential gain for both players.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems fixated on an even split. It's unlikely he'll agree to anything significantly better for Alice, especially as time runs out.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the game carries the risk of getting a worse offer later or even reaching a stalemate where both players get nothing. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share."
