"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 
 
I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000. This ensures I get the majority of the money while still giving him a small incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer to keep more money, accepting this offer guarantees me half of the remaining funds.  It's better than risking nothing in the next round."
