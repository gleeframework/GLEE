"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we split the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a little extra 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $70 is now worth $63, and Bob's gain of $30 is now worth $24.

I'll accept Bob's offer for this round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
