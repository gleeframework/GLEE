"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the amount I'll receive.

However, I'm not sure if Bob is being entirely fair with his proposal. If we split the money evenly, I'll get $50, but considering the inflation rate, that's actually worth less than the $80 I proposed in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to bite! Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 64,
  ""bob_gain"": 36,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to get a better deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $36, which is a smaller share than before, but still a decent amount considering the inflation. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
