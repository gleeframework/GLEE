Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit imbalanced, Alice. How about a 45/55 split?  It's getting late, and the value is dropping for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""The value is dropping fast, Bob, especially for you.  I'll take a little less this round, but we need to settle this quickly.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit on the value, even with a 40/60 split, but we need to end this now before we both lose out more. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is the same as Bob's initial offer, the inflation has significantly eroded his potential gains. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount for me before inflation eats away at it further."
