Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced by your offers, Bob. Meet me in the middle or I'll keep going! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently overvaluing her position due to the rapidly decreasing value of the money for her.  While she may think she's getting a good deal, her actual payout is shrinking each round. Bob needs to continue to push for a more favorable outcome, knowing that time is on his side."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Every round that passes hurts you more than me. Don't let this opportunity slip away!""} 

**Reasoning:**

Offering a 50/50 split at this stage presents a strong psychological play:

* **Fairness:** It removes the haggling aspect and positions the offer as inherently equitable.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the time pressure on Alice, making her reconsider holding out for a larger share that is rapidly diminishing. 
* **Potential Loss Aversion:** By highlighting the potential loss of a good deal, Bob increases the chances of Alice accepting rather than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
