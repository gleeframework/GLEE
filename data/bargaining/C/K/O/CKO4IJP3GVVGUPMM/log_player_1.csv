"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a fair offer, but also gives me a good head start in the game.  I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I will reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, it's still a very unequal split and I believe I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to play the long game and see how the inflation affects things."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation. This offer still gives me a significant share, but it's more reasonable than my first offer. I'm hoping Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers will only hurt him in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. While inflation is starting to have a significant impact, I'm confident I can still get a better deal. Bob's offer is still very unbalanced in his favor, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still hoping Bob will see that this is a reasonable split.  I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share for myself and preventing Bob from becoming completely unreasonable.  Inflation is starting to hurt, but I believe I can still get a decent outcome if I play this strategically."
