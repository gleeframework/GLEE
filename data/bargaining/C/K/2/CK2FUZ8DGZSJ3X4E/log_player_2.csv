"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how Alice reacts to a rejection. While her offer seems fair at first glance, I stand to lose a significant amount to inflation if we wait until the later rounds. It's worth seeing if she's willing to budge a bit."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Your offer was reasonable, but the inflation hits me harder. Let's find a middle ground.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation difference, I've adjusted the offer slightly 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is slowly moving in the right direction, but it's still not enough to offset the impact of inflation on my end.  We're only on round 3, so there's room for further negotiation. Let's see if she's willing to improve her offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a more balanced split to reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts, but I'm still willing to compromise, slightly above my last offer 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting frustrating! Alice is barely budging, and the inflation is steadily chipping away at our potential winnings.  While her offer is tempting considering the circumstances, I need to hold firm a little longer. Let's hope she gets the message and makes a more serious offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the inflation. Let's end this before we both lose out.""}
