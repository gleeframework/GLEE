Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the next rounds' inflation 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While time pressure is increasing, accepting this offer means losing more than half of the original value due to inflation. It's worth holding out for a slightly better deal in the next round or two."

Round 6

{
""bob_gain"": 510000,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, don't let inflation win 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The window of opportunity to get a reasonable deal is closing rapidly. While not ideal, this offer is better than what I might get in the next rounds considering Alice's increasing demands and the accelerating inflation. It's better to secure something now than risk ending up with nothing."
