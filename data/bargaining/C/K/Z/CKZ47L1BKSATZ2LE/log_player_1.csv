I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping to maximize my own gains in the first round. I'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's likely that Bob will continue to offer me an increasingly smaller amount each round. Accepting this offer guarantees me $100,000, and given the inflation, the value of future offers is likely to be much less. It's better to take what I can get now."
