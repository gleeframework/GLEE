Let's see if Bob likes a 90/10 split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm going to offer a slightly better split for myself than the first round, but still leaving Bob with something. Hopefully, this will be more appealing than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a more favorable split, Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round, and the inflation is starting to bite.  I'm going to accept and end this game."
