"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a slightly greedy offer, knowing that the money will depreciate in later rounds. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I'm losing value due to inflation, Bob's offer is extremely unfair. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round where I get to make the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my initial demand slightly, knowing that I'm losing value due to inflation. I think this offer is still fair, considering the circumstances. Let's see if Bob is more willing to negotiate now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is still not ideal, it's the best I can get at this point. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, and I'm risking getting nothing if I continue rejecting offers. It's time to secure something, even if it's a small amount."
