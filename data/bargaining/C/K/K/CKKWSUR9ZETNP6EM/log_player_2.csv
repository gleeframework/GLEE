Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation, I need a larger share 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate and the devaluation of the money is significantly impacting her potential gains.  While her offer isn't great for me, I'm betting she'll be forced to offer even more in the next round to avoid walking away with nothing."

Round 6

""bob_gain"": 60,

# Alice's message: Time is running out, let's meet in the middle considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is feeling the pressure, and her offer is slowly moving in my favor. While still not ideal, the significant devaluation she's facing makes holding out for a better deal worthwhile, even with the risk of getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,

# Alice's message: Let's not be greedy, we both lose if we don't agree 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Time is running out.  While not ideal, getting $40 is better than getting $0 if we run out of rounds. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is unlikely to offer a better deal at this point."
