Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive opening offer. I'm aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with something to incentivize him to accept. Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer to get more money, I'm taking this offer.  With the inflation affecting my gains more, I'm likely to get less money in future rounds.  It's better to take what I can get now."
