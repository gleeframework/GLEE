"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a big share, but I'll give you a small chance to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is being aggressive, isn't he?

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute value of my gain, which is $20. It's a relatively small amount, but I don't want to give up too much control over the negotiation.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A 50-50 split is fair, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more equal distribution of the remaining money. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, Alice. I'll give you a small share, but I need most of it 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting hard! Bob's offer is even more aggressive than before, and the money he's offering me is worth significantly less than before.

Considering the absolute value of my gain, $10 is still a relatively small amount, but I'm not sure if I want to give up so much control over the negotiation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. A 30-70 split is a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, which is still a relatively small share for me, but I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal, Alice. You're getting desperate, aren't you? 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer now. The value of the money he's offering me is worth even less than before.

Considering the absolute value of my gain, $25 is still a relatively small amount, but I'm not sure if I want to give up even more control over the negotiation.

However, I'm also worried that if I reject this offer, the value of the money will continue to decrease, and I might end up with even less in the end. I'll have to weigh the risks and make a decision.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
