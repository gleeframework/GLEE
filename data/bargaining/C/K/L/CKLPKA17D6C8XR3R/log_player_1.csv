Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, as it offers a significant advantage for me, but also provides Bob with a substantial share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose an even 50/50 split.  After Bob's counter-offer, I think this is a fair compromise.  We both receive an equal share, and it avoids further rounds of negotiation and potential inflation."
