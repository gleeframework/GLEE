"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a generous offer, considering I'm the first to make it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is a bit more in his favor than my initial offer. However, considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'd better take what I can get.

I accept the offer.
