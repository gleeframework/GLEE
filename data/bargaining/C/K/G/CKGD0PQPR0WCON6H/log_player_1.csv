Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, I'm looking for a better deal now! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to lose more money to inflation. This is a fair compromise, let's end it here.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not going to take a smaller share now! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is not ideal, it's important to consider the impact of inflation.  My potential gains are significantly reduced compared to the first round, and it's likely that Bob will continue to drive a harder bargain in future rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, and further negotiation could potentially lead to even lower gains."
