"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that Bob will get a slightly worse deal in the next round due to inflation. Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible offer! While Bob gets a significant amount, I'm only getting $5. I'll reject this and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a more balanced 80/20 split in my favor. While Bob still gets less than in the first round, this is a better offer for me than the $5 he proposed. Hopefully, he sees this as a more reasonable proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is still a terrible offer! While Bob gets a significantly larger amount, I'm only getting $10. This is worse than the previous round, and I'm going to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. This is another attempt at a more balanced proposition,  with a  higher gain for me than Bob's last offer.  While inflation is working against Bob, I'm hoping that he'll recognize this as a better deal for him than continuing to reject offers and facing further devaluation of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is still a terrible offer! While Bob gets a significantly larger amount, I'm only getting $15. This is worse than the previous round, and I'm going to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. While Bob still gets less than in the first round, this is a better offer for me than the $15 he proposed.  With inflation working against him, I'm hoping that he'll recognize this as a better deal for him than continuing to reject offers and facing further devaluation of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is still a terrible offer! While Bob gets a significantly larger amount, I'm only getting $20. This is worse than the previous round, and I'm going to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're running out of time! This is a 50/50 split, a perfectly fair offer considering the inflation. I'm hoping that Bob will finally see reason and accept this. We're both losing money with each passing round."
