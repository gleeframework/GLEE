Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a good portion, but I believe my share should be slightly larger given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""alice_gain"": 6400,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I think this offer is fair considering the risk of losing everything. Let's reach an agreement before time runs out. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is the same as his first offer, the value of the money has decreased significantly for him due to inflation. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share for Alice before inflation further erodes her potential gains."
