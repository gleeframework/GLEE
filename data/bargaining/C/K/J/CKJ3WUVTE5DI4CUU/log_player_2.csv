Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58/42, it's the best I can offer for now 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and the pot is shrinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more than that. 52/48 is my final offer.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 57/43, it's a good compromise considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice acknowledges the inflation, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting 430,000 now is a significant loss compared to what we could have gotten in earlier rounds. It's risky, but holding out for a better deal is necessary at this point."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation while you are not.  51/49 is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll go down to 56/44, but that's as low as I'll go 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The situation is becoming critical. While 440,000 is significantly less than what we aimed for, rejecting this offer carries a huge risk. We are now past the halfway point, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for us.  Alice seems firm on her position, and if we reject this, there's a high chance we might end up with nothing in the remaining rounds."
