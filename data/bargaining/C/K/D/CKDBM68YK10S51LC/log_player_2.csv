"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split the money evenly! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The current offer is to split the money evenly, with both of us getting 50 dollars. Since this is the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, and 50 dollars is a decent amount. However, I think I can negotiate for a bit more, considering the rules of the game. If I reject this offer, Alice might be willing to give me a bit more in the next round to avoid losing even more value to inflation.\n\nMy decision is to reject this offer and see what Alice comes up with next.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since we're now in the second round, the money has lost 10% of its value due to inflation. This means the original 100 dollars is now effectively worth 90 dollars. I'll take this into account when making my offer. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is a fair split.""}\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
