"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. It's a good starting point, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to stick with the same offer, but I'll have to consider the effects of inflation.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* My gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, considering the reduced values. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, so the effective values are:

* My gain: 40 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 32
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 51.6

Considering the reduced values, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think 45 is the max I'm willing to offer. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, 50/50. It's a fair split, and I think we can both be happy with this 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

In Round 4, the effective values are:

* My gain: 60 * 0.52 = 31.2
* Bob's gain: 40 * 0.73 = 29.2

Considering the reduced values, Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is actually quite reasonable. I'm willing to accept it, as it's a fair split given the current economic conditions.
