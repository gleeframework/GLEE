"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a little better.  I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to get a little more to make it worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $3600.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a better offer than the 50/50 split I got in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
