"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. I'm taking the remaining 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the amounts.

My proposed gain in Round 1 was $6,000, but due to inflation, it's now worth 90% of that, which is $5,400. Bob's offer is $5,000, which is still worth $5,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer to get a slightly lower amount, but still a significant portion of the original $10,000.
