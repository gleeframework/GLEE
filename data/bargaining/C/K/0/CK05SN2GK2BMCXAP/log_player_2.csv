Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking with my original idea of a more even split.  I understand the inflation, but I'm not going to settle for a worse deal just because we're further down the line. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe for Bob.  While getting only 40% isn't ideal, rejecting this offer means risking an even lower amount in future rounds. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of Bob's potential gains decreases drastically. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently aimed for a more even split and seems unwilling to budge much further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of a slightly better deal in future rounds is significantly outweighed by the risk of getting an even worse deal due to inflation. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting a 40/60 split now minimizes losses in this heavily imbalanced scenario."
