"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm looking for a majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the $1,000,000 and Bob getting 20%. I'm framing it as a fair share, but also hinting that I'm looking for a majority, implying that I'm not interested in a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a majority, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting $100,000, which is worth 10% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob is getting $900,000, which is worth 90% of the original $1,000,000. This is a significant difference, and I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a decent share. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, with me getting 60% of the $1,000,000 and Bob getting 40%. I'm framing it as a compromise, suggesting that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but still want a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight majority, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting $300,000, which is worth approximately 30% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob is getting $700,000, which is worth approximately 70% of the original $1,000,000. This is a significant imbalance, and I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still want a fair share. Can we find a middle ground?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 5.5:4.5 split, with me getting 55% of the $1,000,000 and Bob getting 45%. I'm framing it as a desperate attempt to find a middle ground, suggesting that I'm willing to compromise further to avoid giving up too much."
