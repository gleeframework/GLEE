Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money early, knowing that inflation might affect things in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking further rounds of potential inflation and getting nothing at all."
