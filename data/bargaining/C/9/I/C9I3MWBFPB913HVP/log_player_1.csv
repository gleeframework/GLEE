"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer from my side, considering the game just started and the money is still worth 100% of its original value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, this offer is less favorable to me. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the money is now worth 90% of its original value for me and 80% for Bob, I'll make a new offer that's slightly more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
