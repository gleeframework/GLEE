"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial $100, which is $30. I'll take the remaining 70%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain of $70 is now worth $63.

Bob's offer is 50% of the remaining $100, which is $50. I'll take the remaining 50%.

I accept Bob's offer.
