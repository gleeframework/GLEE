"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $60 and Bob can have $40. I've included a message to try to persuade Bob that this is a fair division. Let's see what he says!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's not very fair, let's be more realistic. This is my offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it. The money is still worth the same to me, so I don't feel pressured to accept a worse deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, Bob, meet me in the middle!""}\n\nI'll reduce my offer a bit to try to entice Bob to accept. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I'm not feeling the pressure of inflation. Let's see if Bob is more willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting us nowhere. Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I'm not losing anything by waiting. However, Bob is losing value due to inflation, so I think he's more likely to make a better offer as the rounds go on. But since he's offering an even split, which is a relatively good deal, I'll accept it to end the game.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
