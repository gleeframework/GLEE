"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 80-20 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm leaving room for negotiation, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more generous than my initial proposal, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share given the current market conditions.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 and call it a day 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be very careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50-50 split is a reasonable compromise, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll accept this offer to get a stable and fair share.
