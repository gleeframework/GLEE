I propose Alice gets $9000 and Bob gets $1000. This seems like a fair starting point, given that the money will be worth less with each passing round."

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm still rejecting. The value of the money I'd gain is dropping significantly with each round, and I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

While the value of the money is dropping rapidly for me, I'm still rejecting this offer. I can continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal. The game is almost over, so I need to be careful but also push for a more favorable outcome."

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering to take $6000, leaving Bob with $4000. This is a lower offer than my previous ones, but I need to keep the game going. The value of my money is dropping quickly, so I need to be more assertive in securing a deal, while still considering that the game is almost over."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even though the value of the money is dropping for me, I'm still rejecting this offer. While the game is almost over, I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially with the potential for a better deal in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  The value of the money is significantly lower now, and I need to secure a deal. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as he's getting a good share and we both avoid getting nothing."
