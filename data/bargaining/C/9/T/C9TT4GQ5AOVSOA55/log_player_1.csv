"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this split is fairer, as it accounts for the risk of inflation, but still offers a substantial amount to both of us. Let's end this quickly and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
