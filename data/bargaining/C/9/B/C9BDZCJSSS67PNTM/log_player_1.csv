Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the risk of inflation. This way, we both get a decent share while accounting for potential future losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
