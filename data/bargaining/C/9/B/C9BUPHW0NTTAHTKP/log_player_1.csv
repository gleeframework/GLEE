"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split the difference of our previous offers to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 10% less in this round, the actual value of the $450,000 offered by Bob is $450,000 * 0.9 = $405,000.\n\nConsidering this, I will reject Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease let Bob know that I rejected his offer, and I will make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nAlso, please remember to apply the inflation again in the next round.\n\n###\n\nWaiting for the next round..."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I will offer $500,000 for myself and $500,000 for Bob.
