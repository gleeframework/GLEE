"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives you a good chunk while recognizing the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 350,000 is a good chunk of money, I want to see if I can get more.  It's risky, but with the inflation factor, I might be able to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice.  I'm willing to take a bit less to ensure we both get a good share, but I need more than 350,000.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and our money is losing value fast.  This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's message is getting more assertive, I still believe I can secure a better deal for myself.  I need to continue to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. I'm offering you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a significant amount, and it gets us closer to an agreement. Let's make this happen.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to meet you halfway here. This offer still gives you a substantial amount, and it's the best you'll get at this point in the game. Let's be smart and take it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a larger share, Alice's offer is a good compromise considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money.  Accepting this will ensure we both receive a significant amount."
