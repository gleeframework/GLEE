"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need a decent share. Let's settle this before we lose even more money! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Given the inflation rate, accepting this offer would give me significantly less than what I could have gotten in Round 1. It's worth risking another round to negotiate a better deal."
