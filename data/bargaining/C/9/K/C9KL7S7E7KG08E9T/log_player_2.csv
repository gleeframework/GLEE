"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get $60 and you get $40. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation rate affects Alice more.

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 55-45 is more reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, the clock is ticking and the value is dropping. Let's settle this now: I take $55, you take $45.  Deal? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both of our gains, I think Alice's offer is reasonable at this point, especially since the value is dropping more significantly for her.
