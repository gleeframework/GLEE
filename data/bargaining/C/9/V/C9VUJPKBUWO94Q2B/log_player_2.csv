Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90, and you get 10.  Let's see if you're willing to negotiate!

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite lopsided. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  The value of the money decreases for both of us each round, so a fair agreement now is in both our best interests.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see we're both willing to negotiate. I'm willing to budge to a 45/55 split.  This is closer to your proposal, but I need to be able to get at least a bit more than 30 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
