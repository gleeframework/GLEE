"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable outcome. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. The split is not fair, and I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Besides, the inflation rate is higher for Alice, so I'm willing to take the risk and make a counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal that will be more beneficial to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation rates and my desired outcome. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll try to make an offer that is more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice.\n\n###\n\nHere's my offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think this offer is more balanced. Let's try to reach an agreement before the money loses more value.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice and let me know her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. With inflation affecting us both, it's the most sensible solution.  We can avoid further losses and move on. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll evaluate Alice's new offer considering the inflation rates and the current state of the game. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me and 36% less for Alice compared to the first round, I need to take this into account when making my decision.\n\n###\n\nGiven the even split and the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is more reasonable than the previous ones. I'll consider accepting it to avoid further losses due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nHere's my response:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I'm accepting her offer, and we can conclude the game."
