"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the values, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer is still a significant reduction from the original 50/50 split.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the decrease in purchasing power.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to keep up with inflation!""
}
```"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on the value of the money. With the money worth 14.26% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

While Bob's offer is a slight increase from his previous one, I'm still not sure if it's enough to compensate for the decreased value of the money. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to get a better deal.
