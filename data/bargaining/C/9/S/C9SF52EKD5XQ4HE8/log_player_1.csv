"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy in the first round, now it's my turn to be fair... or not? 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial offer and now wants a larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I don't think it's fair. I'm hoping that Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round, taking into account the inflation that's affecting my end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a more even split than my initial offer, but still gives me a smaller share than Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finally divide the money."
