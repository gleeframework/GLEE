Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is unfair and I will not accept it. I am willing to negotiate, but I will not accept such a drastic shift in the division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. This is still a fair deal given the inflation, and I hope Bob will recognize that we need to find a compromise."
