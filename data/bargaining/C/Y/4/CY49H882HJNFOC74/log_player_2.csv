"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation. 

In the first round, $25 was worth 100% of the initial value. In the third round, $40 is worth 80% of the initial value (since there's a 20% loss due to inflation). So, in the third round, I'm actually getting $40 * (100/80) = $50 in today's value.

I'll accept this offer.
