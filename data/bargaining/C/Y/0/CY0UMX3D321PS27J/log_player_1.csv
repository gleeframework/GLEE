"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but it's still a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of getting something rather than waiting and risking getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me so little. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but I'm still keeping a significant portion of the money. This offer shows I'm willing to compromise while also ensuring I get a fair share. I hope Bob will see the value in accepting this deal before the inflation further reduces his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy! Even with the inflation, his offer is still too low. I won't accept a deal that gives me such a small share, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to show flexibility. I'm hoping Bob will realize that the inflation is working against him and he'll be more willing to accept a fair deal. We are quickly running out of time and if we don't reach an agreement, we'll both lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly unreasonable! Despite the significant inflation impacting his gains, he still refuses to offer me a decent share. I'm not going to be taken advantage of, especially when there are still several rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  While I still want a majority of the money, we're running out of time and I need to find a solution before we both lose everything."
