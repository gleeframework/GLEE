Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, knowing that the value of the deal decreases significantly for me with each round. While her offer is getting closer to something acceptable, I need to hold my ground a bit longer to see if I can secure a better split in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be real.  We're running out of time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this.""} 

**Reasoning:**

The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. By round 6, the impact of inflation is becoming significant. A 50/50 split might have been ideal from the start, but it's still the best option available considering the decreasing value of the potential winnings. It sends a message that I'm serious about getting this done and eliminates further risk of walking away with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split was a nice try, but I think I can do better! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the clock is ticking.  Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much further, and the value of the deal is rapidly decreasing for me. Accepting this offer, while not ideal, is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
