"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, my share of $400,000 is actually equivalent to $384,000 in the first round's value. Meanwhile, Bob's share of $600,000 is equivalent to $600,000 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, as I'd rather have a more balanced split. I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60/40, I'll aim for a more balanced split in my new proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is slightly more favorable to me than the previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

Considering the reduced value of my share, I'll evaluate Bob's offer carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my share of $300,000 is actually equivalent to $257,940 in the first round's value. Meanwhile, Bob's share of $700,000 is equivalent to $700,000 in the first round's value.

While the 75/25 split is not ideal, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer this time, hoping that the game will end soon.
