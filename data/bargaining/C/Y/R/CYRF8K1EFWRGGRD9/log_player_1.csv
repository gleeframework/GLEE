"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering you $3,000, and I'll take the remaining $7,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll consider the effective values as follows:

* My gain: $6,000 / 0.8 = $7,500 (in the original value)
* Bob's gain: $4,000 / 0.9 = $4,444.44 (in the original value)

Considering the reduced value of money, I think this offer is more favorable to me than my original offer. I'll accept this offer.
