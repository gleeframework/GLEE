"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I'll take 60%, you get 40%.  We can adjust if you want to play more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal than accept 40% right off the bat. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and account for inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice's offer of 40% for me was too low, I'll try to meet her halfway while also considering the impact of inflation on our gains. Hopefully, she'll see this as a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's time to be reasonable. Let's split the money evenly and avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, accepting the 50/50 split now seems like the best option. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money, so it's reasonable to accept this offer and avoid additional losses."
