Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time value of money. Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at our gains further. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to meet you halfway here. This offer acknowledges the time pressure but is still fair to both of us. Let's close this deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear we both value our time, and this split represents a fair compromise considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are significant on my potential gains. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer of $400,000 is better than risking further devaluation with another rejection."
