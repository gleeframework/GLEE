"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4,800. Now, considering Bob's offer, I'd get $5,000, which is worth 80% of $6,250, which is my gain in the previous round. This offer is better than my original gain, but worse than my gain in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 20% inflation, my gain from the previous round is now worth 64% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). Since my gain in the previous round was $6,000, it's now worth $3,840.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```"
