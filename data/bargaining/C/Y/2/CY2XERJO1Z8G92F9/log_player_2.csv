"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer still leaves you with a good sum. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise to avoid further losses. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's split it 55-45.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing Bob, let's settle this now. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I'm not feeling the pressure of inflation. On the other hand, Alice is experiencing a 19% decrease in value, and this will only get worse for her in subsequent rounds. I'll hold out for a better offer, as Alice's desperation may increase in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""You said the value is decreasing, and I know it's affecting you more than me. I'm willing to take a bigger share now. This might be your last chance to get a decent amount.""}"
