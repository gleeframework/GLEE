"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive 600,000$ and Bob receives 400,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to consider the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate my gain in terms of the original amount. 

My gain in the first round was 600,000$. With 5% inflation, that's equivalent to 600,000 / 1.05 = 571,428.57$. 

Now, considering Bob's offer, I'll have 300,000$ in this round, which is equivalent to 300,000 / 1.05 = 285,714.29$. 

Bob's gain is 700,000$, which is equivalent to 700,000 / 1.1 = 636,363.64$. 

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather have more money in the long run.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less with each round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive 700,000$ and Bob receives 300,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll calculate the equivalent values in terms of the original amount.

My gain in the first round was 600,000$. With 14.26% inflation, that's equivalent to 600,000 / 1.1426 = 524,186.19$.

Bob's offer is 450,000$, which is equivalent to 450,000 / 1.271 = 353,544.39$.

Bob's gain is 550,000$, which is equivalent to 550,000 / 1.271 = 432,455.19$.

I'll accept this offer, as it's better than what I'd get in future rounds.
