"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm hoping to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm hoping he'll think it's a generous offer and be willing to accept, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm looking for a better deal for myself. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly. However, I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is a good deal for me, especially since I think he's trying to take advantage of the inflation.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to the cumulative 20% inflation. I'll need to be more aggressive in my offer to account for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the reduced value, which is $45, but I'm hoping to negotiate further and get a better deal for myself."
