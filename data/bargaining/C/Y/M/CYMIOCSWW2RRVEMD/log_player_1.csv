"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll evaluate the offer.

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round. I'll make a new offer, taking this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money, which is a bit more than before to compensate for the decrease in value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 675000 
# Bob gain: 325000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the money's value.

Considering the new offer, I think I can live with getting 67.5% of the money. It's a bit less than my previous offer, but it's still a decent share considering the reduced value of the money.
