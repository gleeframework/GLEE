"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm offering Bob a significant portion of the total amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! My gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With my money worth 48.8% less, I need to be very careful.

However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, with him taking 60% of the total amount. I'll think carefully before deciding...

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.
