"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. Since the money is worth less for Bob, this should be a good deal for him, and it is a significant portion of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept the offer. While I am taking a small loss from the previous round,  Bob is losing a significant portion of the value of his share due to the inflation. This seems like a fair compromise, especially as the game could go on and further reduce the value of the money."
