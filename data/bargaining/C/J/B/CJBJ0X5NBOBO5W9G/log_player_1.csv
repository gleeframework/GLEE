I'm going for a pretty aggressive split in the first round.  I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'm hoping to get the most I can early on.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'm taking a significant cut from my initial demand, the inflation means that my share is effectively worth less than it was in the previous round.  Accepting this offer means I still get a sizable amount, and I don't risk losing any more money due to inflation."
