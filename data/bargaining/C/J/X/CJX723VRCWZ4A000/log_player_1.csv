"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation, but it's a good deal for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  This is much fairer considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is tempting as it's more than I would have gotten in round 1. However, it's still heavily in Bob's favor, and the inflation will hurt me more in later rounds.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. I understand the inflation affects me more, but your last offer was too far in your favor. This is a compromise.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Every round that passes hurts you more than it hurts me. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is right, time is running out and the inflation is eating into my potential gains. While I'd prefer more, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds.
