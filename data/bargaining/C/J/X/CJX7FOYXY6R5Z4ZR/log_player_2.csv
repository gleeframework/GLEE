Alice's offer is still worse than my initial proposal, and I don't know how much the inflation is impacting her.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get a larger share this time.  I think Alice might be getting desperate!"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Even though I'm not sure how much inflation is affecting Alice, a 50/50 split is a decent outcome, especially since I'm not losing value due to inflation."
