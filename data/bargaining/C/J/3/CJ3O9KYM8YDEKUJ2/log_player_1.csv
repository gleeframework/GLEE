I propose to take 900,000 dollars, leaving 100,000 dollars for Bob. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation dynamic that favors me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. This seems like the fairest option considering the current inflation rate, as we are both losing a significant portion of the money with each passing round."
