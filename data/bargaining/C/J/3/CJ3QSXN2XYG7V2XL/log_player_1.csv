"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm not getting taken to the cleaners that easily. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 20 * 0.8 = 16
Bob gain: 80 * 0.8 = 64

My response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer, as I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but with a slight bias towards me, of course!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it. I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving you the upper hand. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

Initial $100 * 0.52 (1 - 0.48) = $52 (this is the value of the money after 3 rounds of inflation)

Alice gain: 40 * 0.52 = 20.8
Bob gain: 60 * 0.52 = 31.2

My response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer, as I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'm not confident that the inflation will continue to favor me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Time to get serious, Bob. Let's split it 50/50 and end this game.""
}
```

I'm making a more even split, trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and end the game."
