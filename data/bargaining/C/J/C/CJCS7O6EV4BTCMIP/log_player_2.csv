"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer sounds fair on the surface, it doesn't fully account for the fact that I (Bob) am losing money at a slower rate. I need to negotiate for a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on me, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is feeling the pressure of the faster inflation, but this offer isn't good enough yet. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  We both lose if this goes on too long. This offer is fair considering the time pressure."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time. I'm still willing to compromise, but need a slightly better share due to the inflation hit I'm taking. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but time is running out.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of her faster inflation rate and is unlikely to offer me a better deal. Accepting now secures me something, while continuing to hold out risks getting nothing at all."
