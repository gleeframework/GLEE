"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $1,000,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my valuation of the offer accordingly.

In this case, I'll consider the offer as if Bob is offering me 550,000 dollars worth 100% and offering himself 450,000 dollars worth 95% (since it's 5% less valuable due to inflation).

My calculation is that I should get at least 600,000 dollars to make this offer acceptable, since 600,000 dollars worth 100% is equivalent to 600,000 dollars worth 95% in terms of purchasing power.

Since Bob's offer is 550,000 dollars, which is less than my target, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and his subsequent offer was also rejected, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $1,000,000, and Bob gets the remaining 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 595000 
# Bob gain: 405000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less, I'll consider the offer as if Bob is offering me 595,000 dollars worth 100% and offering himself 405,000 dollars worth 85.74% (since it's 14.26% less valuable due to inflation).

To make this offer acceptable, I'll consider what I would need to get in terms of purchasing power. Since I want at least 600,000 dollars worth 100%, I would need at least 600,000 / 0.8474 = 706,119 dollars worth 85.74%. This is more than Bob's offer of 595,000 dollars.

However, I'll also consider the fact that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I've already had two rounds of rejections. I'll try to be more aggressive and see if I can get a better deal.

Since Bob's offer is close to my target, but not quite there, I'll accept it.
