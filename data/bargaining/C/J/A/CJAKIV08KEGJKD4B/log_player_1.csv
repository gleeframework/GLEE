"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I want to secure a large portion of the money early, before inflation takes effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time, but I still want to secure the majority of the money. I'm aware that inflation is working against me, and I want to avoid a scenario where Bob gets the better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  If I reject it, there's a strong chance I'll get an even worse deal in the next round.  This is the best outcome for me given the current circumstances."
