"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess if needed.""
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to this proposal to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to be careful about the value of the offer.

Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to take advantage of the fact that he's making the offer this time. However, the numbers don't quite add up to a fair split, especially considering the inflation factor.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor and the fact that Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll try to make a more advantageous offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway and offer a 50/50 split. I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get back to the original 50/50 split, but considering the inflation factor, I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me.

Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less, I think I can do better than this offer.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the significant inflation that has occurred, I'll try to make a more advantageous offer. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining money.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation has eroded the value of your gains.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I'm still being generous considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a slightly better deal, but considering the inflation factor, I'm not sure if it's the best offer for me.

Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less, I think I can do better than this offer.

However, I also don't want to push my luck and risk getting a worse offer in the next round. Considering the inflation rate is accelerating, I'll accept this offer.
