"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
I'm offering you $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, $4,000 is equivalent to $5,000 in the first round, which is a decent offer. But I'm not sure if I want to settle for that.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation that has already occurred. Since the money is worth 80% of its original value, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in purchasing power.

Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
