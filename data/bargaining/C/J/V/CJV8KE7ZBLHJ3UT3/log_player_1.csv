"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. This is a generous offer, considering we're starting from a high amount and inflation is not a concern yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation effect, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm gaining 550,000, but it's worth 5% less than what I initially proposed, which is 600,000. However, Bob is gaining 450,000, which is worth 10% less than what he initially proposed, which is 500,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll aim to gain a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering you 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 675000 
# Bob gain: 325000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. The inflation effect has taken a toll on the value of the money, and I'm gaining 675,000, which is worth 14.26% less than my initial proposal of 600,000. However, Bob is gaining 325,000, which is worth 27.1% less than his initial proposal of 450,000.

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it seems like a decent compromise given the changing circumstances.
