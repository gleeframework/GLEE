I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I'm aiming for a large share, but I want to leave room for negotiation in the next round.  Let's see if Bob is happy with this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While the money is worth the same for me, Bob's offer is far too low compared to my initial proposal. I'm willing to negotiate, but this is too much of a swing in the other direction.  Let's see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a large share. With inflation hitting Bob harder, he's likely to be more motivated to negotiate a deal."
