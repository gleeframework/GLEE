"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 95% of the original $5000, which is $4750. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 80% of the original $5000, which is $4800.

I accept this offer, as I get a better deal than I initially proposed.
