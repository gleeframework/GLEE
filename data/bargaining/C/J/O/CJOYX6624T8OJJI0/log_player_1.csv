"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Since inflation affects my side, I want to maximize my gains early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with inflation, Bob's offer is still better than what I would get if I reject it and make a counter-offer in the next round."
