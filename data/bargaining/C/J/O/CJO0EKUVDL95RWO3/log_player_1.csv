"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking almost all the money!  Since I don't know how inflation impacts Bob, I'm going to be greedy and see if he'll accept this incredibly lopsided offer. ðŸ˜ˆ  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep the lion's share, Bob's offer is still significantly better than what I would get if we continue playing. Inflation might continue to erode my potential gains, and it's not clear how much Bob is actually losing due to it.  It's time to be practical and take the money! ðŸ’°"
