"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  This maximizes my potential gain, and hopefully sets a good precedent."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still generous, but I'm confident that I can do better. Since he rejected my first offer, he is likely to be more willing to compromise in the next round when I make the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

Since Bob rejected my first offer but accepted a slightly less favorable offer in round 2, I'm adjusting my offer to be slightly more generous than his.  This should incentivize him to accept, while still giving me a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is hitting hard, and while I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is still reasonably generous, especially given that he's been playing hardball. It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
