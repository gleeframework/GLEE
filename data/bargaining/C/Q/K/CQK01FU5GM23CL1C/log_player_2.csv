"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think a 60/40 split is reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split would be more reasonable, and I'll take the larger share since the money is worth less for Alice in each subsequent round. Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Considering inflation, 55/45 seems fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can find a more even split considering both inflation and the fact that I rejected your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth significantly less for Alice in each subsequent round (36% less now), she may be more willing to compromise in the next round to avoid further losses. I'll take the risk and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","In this round, I'll consider the significant decrease in value for Alice and make an offer that might seem more reasonable given the circumstances. Since the money is worth 36% less for Alice, she might be more inclined to accept a slightly less favorable split to avoid further devaluation. Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Given the significant inflation impact on your side, I think this split is reasonable.""}"
