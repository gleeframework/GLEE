Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful with my proposal.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.
