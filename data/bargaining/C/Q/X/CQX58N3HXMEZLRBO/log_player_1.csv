"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose to keep 990,000 dollars for myself and give 10,000 dollars to Bob. This ensures I get the majority of the money while giving Bob a small amount to incentivize him to potentially accept.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 215635 
# Bob gain: 784365 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While he's offering a significantly higher amount than he did in the first round, it's still not a fair deal.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the future rounds, especially considering the inflation affecting Bob's potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 900,000 for myself and 100,000 for Bob.  Since inflation is hitting Bob harder, I'm hoping he'll be more inclined to accept a slightly better offer than last round.  Let's see if this is more appealing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 379079 
# Bob gain: 620921 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer again.  While his offer is getting higher, the inflation is working against him, and I know he'll eventually be forced to accept a deal that's closer to my initial proposal. I'm not in a rush to settle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to 850,000 for myself and 150,000 for Bob. With inflation hitting Bob hard, I think he'll be forced to accept a better offer from me than what he's currently getting. Let's see if this is the turning point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me!  While I'd prefer to get more, with the inflation working against Bob, I'm unlikely to get a better offer in the future rounds.  It's time to settle for a fair split."
