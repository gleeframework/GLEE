"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe fairness should be our guiding principle. Here's a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure what to make of Bob's offer. A 50/50 split seems fair, but I'm not sure if he's trying to take advantage of the fact that I don't know how the inflation affects him.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much. Your turn again!""
}
```"
