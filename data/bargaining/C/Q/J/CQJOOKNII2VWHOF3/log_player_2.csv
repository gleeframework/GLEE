"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that I lose money at a faster rate than you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% decrease in value for me is less than the 10% decrease for Alice, so I have some leverage. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think this is a fair split. You lose more value each round, so it's in your interest to accept this offer.""}\n\nLet's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This offer is my compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still think I can get a better deal. The fact that Alice is losing value at a faster rate gives me some bargaining power. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a more favorable offer. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I understand that inflation is affecting you more, but I also need to consider my own losses. This offer is a bit more generous than before, but I'm still taking into account the difference in our inflation rates. It's time to meet in the middle!""}\n\nLet's see if Alice is willing to accept this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money by being stubborn. I'm making a final offer - meet me halfway and we can both walk away with something decent. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","I think this is a good time to accept the offer. The inflation rates are really starting to take a toll on the value of the money, and I don't want to risk losing even more value by prolonging the game. Meeting Alice halfway seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'll still come out with a decent amount. Time to wrap this up!
