"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60, you get 40.""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get a decent amount of money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a little better than that. Let's try 60 for me and 40 for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer, considering the inflation effect.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I need to adjust my valuation accordingly.

My gain of $40 in this round is equivalent to $38.46 in the first round (100% / 1.05). Bob's gain of $60 is equivalent to $54.55 in the first round (100% / 0.9).

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. How about 55 for me and 45 for you?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, considering the inflation effect, but I'm still keeping the offer relatively close to the original 60-40 split."
