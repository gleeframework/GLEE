This is a tough one. Alice is clearly playing hardball, but time is working against both of us.  Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Significant Inflation:**  The longer this goes on, the less money we both get.  Another round or two and the difference between our offers won't be that significant.
* **Better Than Nothing:** Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds.

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, taking $4,500 now is better than risking a complete loss later."
