I'm starting with a very large offer for myself, but a small amount for Bob.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept quickly to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though this is a much lower gain for me, I'll accept.  The inflation is really eating away at the money and it's only going to get worse. It's better to get something than nothing at this point."
