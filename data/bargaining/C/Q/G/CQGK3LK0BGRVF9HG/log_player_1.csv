"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the effective values are:

Alice's gain: $4,000 (pre-inflation value of $5,000)
Bob's gain: $6,000 (pre-inflation value of $6,800)

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal with this offer. I'd rather negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the effective value is $3,200 for me.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see what you think!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 61.25/38.75 split, giving me $3,200 and Bob $6,800. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much more! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the effective values are:

Alice's gain: $1,600 (pre-inflation value of $3,200)
Bob's gain: $5,200 (pre-inflation value of $7,000)

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm getting desperate. I think I should take it, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.
