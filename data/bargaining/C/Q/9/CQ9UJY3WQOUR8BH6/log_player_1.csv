"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a fair share, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risk of inflation. This way, we both get a decent amount now and in the future. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
