"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the 10% and let's talk.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share to get the ball rolling, and I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."

# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
