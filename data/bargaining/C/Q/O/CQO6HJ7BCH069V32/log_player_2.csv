{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit unfair to me. How about we try a 55/45 split in my favor? The value of the money is going down each round, especially for you.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable.  We both lose money with each round.  How about a 50/50 split? It's fair, and we can get this done before we both lose too much. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
