"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob! Accept my generous offer and we can move on to more important things.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $800,000 * 0.8 = $640,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, but I'll assume it is for now.

In any case, I think this is a reasonable offer, and I'd like to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
