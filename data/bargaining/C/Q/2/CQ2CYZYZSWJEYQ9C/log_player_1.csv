"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'll start with a highly lopsided offer. It's unlikely Bob will accept, but it sets the stage for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is better than my previous one, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. The inflation is only affecting Bob, so I have the upper hand."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to propose a reversal of Bob's offer. He's facing inflation now, and I want to make sure I get the lion's share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is facing significant inflation, and his offers are getting progressively worse. This is a good deal for me considering the potential for even lower offers in the future."
