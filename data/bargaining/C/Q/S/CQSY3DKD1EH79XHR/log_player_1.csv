This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but I'm willing to share a small amount with Bob to hopefully secure a deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to try to secure a deal this round by offering Bob a slightly larger share. While the inflation hurt me, I think this offer still benefits me significantly."
