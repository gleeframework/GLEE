"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the $100 equally. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Understand the offer
Alice is proposing to divide the $100 equally between us.

## Step 2: Evaluate the offer
Since the money is divided equally, I would get $50 and Alice would also get $50.

## Step 3: Consider alternatives
If I reject the offer, I will have the opportunity to propose a different division in the next round.

## Step 4: Make a decision
Since I have no information that suggests I could get a better deal by rejecting, and because the offer seems fair, I will accept the offer.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
