"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'll start by offering a very slight advantage to myself.  I'm hoping Bob will see that accepting this offer is the best way to ensure he gets *something* in this game.  We'll see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair. Even though the money is worth less for him, it's still a significantly better deal for him than the first offer.  I'm not going to let him take advantage of me like that!  I'll see what kind of offer he'll make in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to decrease my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  I need to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair share, but also that I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting even more ridiculous.  He's taking advantage of the inflation, and it's clear he's just trying to push me to the very edge.  I'm not giving in.  It's time for me to be more assertive and try to take back some control."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split, but I still want a larger share than Bob. I need to strike a balance between being assertive and being reasonable. This offer shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to be completely taken advantage of."
