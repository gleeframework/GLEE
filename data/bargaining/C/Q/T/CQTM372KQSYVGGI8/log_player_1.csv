"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is the reverse of my previous one, and I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly adjusted.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'll offer Bob 55% of the current value of the money, and keep 45% for myself."
