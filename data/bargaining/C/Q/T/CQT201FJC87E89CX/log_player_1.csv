"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to start with a very simple offer. I'll take the majority of the money (90$) and leave Bob with 10$. Since this is the first round, I don't want to risk losing the money to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
