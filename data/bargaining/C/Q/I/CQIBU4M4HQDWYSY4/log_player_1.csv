"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  This way we both get a good amount, and we can avoid any further rounds and get our money! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of $50 is actually worth $45 in real value.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
