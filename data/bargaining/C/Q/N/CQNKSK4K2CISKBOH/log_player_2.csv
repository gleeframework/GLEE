Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll make a small concession. 57% for me, 43% for you. This is my new idea of fair 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer, but it's still early in the game. While the effects of inflation are starting to become noticeable, it's important to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would still give Alice a significantly larger share.  It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a more balanced outcome."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. 54% for me, 46% for you. Inflation is hurting me too, you know 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is acknowledging the inflation pressure, her concessions are too small. Accepting a 46/54 split at this stage would leave a significant amount of money on the table, especially considering the rapid devaluation we face with each passing round. It's a risk, but holding out for a better deal is still the optimal strategy."

""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest deal, especially with inflation eating away at our potential gains.  Agreeing now ensures we both walk away with a substantial sum.""
