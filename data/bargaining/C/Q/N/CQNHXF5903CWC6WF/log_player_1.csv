"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a decent chunk of the money while leaving some room for negotiation.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since Bob's offer is 50/50, it's a fair split, but I'd like to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation rate still in effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting Bob's gain more significantly, I'll consider this offer carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll take a closer look at the numbers. However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to give Bob a larger share, especially considering the inflation factor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the increasing inflation rate and my desire to get a larger share.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation rate is really taking a toll on the money's value! With Bob's offer, I'd be getting a smaller share, but considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the long-term implications. I'll accept this offer to avoid losing more value due to inflation.
