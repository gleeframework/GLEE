"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and hoping Bob will be willing to accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiating 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more for taking the risk, huh?

I'm not convinced, but I'll consider his proposal. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think you're still getting a bit too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to give Bob the majority of the money."
