"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a larger share than me, especially with the money being worth less due to inflation!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm trying to balance the shares, but with a slight advantage for myself to account for the inflation."
