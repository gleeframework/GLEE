Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer was quite lopsided. Let's be reasonable: I take 60%, you take 40%. It's a good deal before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
