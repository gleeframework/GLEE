Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the higher inflation rate affecting me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split. While I'm aware of the inflation affecting me, I think this is a fair compromise considering Bob's rejection of my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm getting significantly less than my initial proposal, accepting this offer ensures I get something, whereas rejecting it risks ending the game with nothing.  The inflation is hitting me hard, and I don't want to risk losing everything."
