"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting 6000 and Bob getting 4000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation differential."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Since my money is worth less each round, waiting longer risks getting less in the end."
