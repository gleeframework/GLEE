Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

 I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round, keeping 90% of the money for myself.  This will give Bob a chance to counter-propose if he feels it's too unfair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's a significant improvement over the previous round and inflation is a factor. Accepting this offer secures a good portion of the money, while rejecting it risks a worse offer in the future."
