"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, with a message that suggests this is a fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly. Let's work together! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, and I initially offered Bob $400,000 while keeping $600,000 for myself, I see no reason to accept a deal where I get the lower amount. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can come to a more favorable agreement.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my next offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet halfway!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet halfway!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself, suggesting that we meet halfway between our previous proposals. This way, we both compromise, but considering the inflation affecting Bob's gain, this might be a slightly more favorable offer for him compared to the previous round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
