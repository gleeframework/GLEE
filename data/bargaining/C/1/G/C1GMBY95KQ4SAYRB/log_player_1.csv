I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start, hoping he'll accept it. If he doesn't, I'll be able to offer more in the next round after inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's not ideal, but I'm getting 5000, and even with the inflation, it's better than getting nothing at all. I'm accepting the offer."
