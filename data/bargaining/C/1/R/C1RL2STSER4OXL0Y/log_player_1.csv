Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation we're facing. This way, we both get a decent amount even after the discount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
