"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the significant difference in the proposed split, and I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is still a good deal. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk too!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, giving Bob a larger share of $600,000, while I'll take $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think it's a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the extremely lopsided split, and I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of. The fact that the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round makes me even more hesitant to accept such a small share. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round to make a new proposal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want to keep some for myself!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split, giving Bob a larger share of $700,000, while I'll take $300,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
