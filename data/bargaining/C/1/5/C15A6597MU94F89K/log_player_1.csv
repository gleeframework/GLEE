"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, aiming to incentivize Bob to accept quickly.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Bob is being greedy, but I can see he's willing to negotiate.  I'll propose a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, aiming for a 60/40 division in my favor.  This should be more appealing to Bob than his previous proposal, and it still gives me a good share of the money."
