"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since my gain is worth 10% less, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the relative value of the split.

In the first round, I proposed a 60-40 split, which was worth 60-40 dollars. In the second round, that's equivalent to 54-36 dollars (60*0.9 and 40*0.8).

Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is equivalent to 45-45 dollars (50*0.9 for me, and 50*0.8 for Bob).

I think I can do better than that! I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since my gain is worth 10% less each round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the decrease in value.

I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is equivalent to 49-36.5 dollars (55*0.9 for me, and 45*0.8 for Bob).

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, but with a slight edge""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but still fair! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! My gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less.

Let's calculate the equivalent values for the proposed split:

My gain of 40 dollars is equivalent to 29.3 dollars (40*0.729, since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%).
Bob's gain of 60 dollars is equivalent to 30.72 dollars (60*0.5112, since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. On one hand, it's a relatively small difference between our gains. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal considering the inflation.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was a 60-40 split, and I rejected it, I'll try to push for a more favorable split this time.

Considering the inflation effect, I'll propose a 60-40 split again, but this time with the correct equivalent values. My gain of 60 dollars is equivalent to 43.56 dollars (60*0.728, since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%), and Bob's gain of 40 dollars is equivalent to 22.88 dollars (40*0.5715, since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%).

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Stick with the original plan, but with a slight adjustment""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take what I can get, considering the economy! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting out of control! My gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less.

Let's calculate the equivalent values for the proposed split:

My gain of 30 dollars is equivalent to 17.71 dollars (30*0.592, since 100% - 40.95% = 59.05%).
Bob's gain of 70 dollars is equivalent to 23.51 dollars (70*0.336, since 100% - 67.23% = 32.77%).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. On one hand, it's a very lopsided split, and I'm getting a relatively small amount. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.

I'll think about it for a moment...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a final push for a better deal. Considering the inflation effect, I'll propose a 50-50 split, but with the correct equivalent values. My gain of 50 dollars is equivalent to 29.4 dollars (50*0.588, since 100% - 40.95% = 59.05%), and Bob's gain of 50 dollars is equivalent to 29.4 dollars (50*0.588).

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a fair split, Bob!""
