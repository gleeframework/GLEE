"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would receive $500,000 and Bob would receive $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, since you're getting a bigger discount. Let's try 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since I'm getting a bigger discount due to inflation, I might as well try to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair. How about 55/45?""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 455000, ""bob_gain"": 545000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about 45.5/54.5?""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, giving Bob a slightly larger share while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
