"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll get $500,000 and Bob will get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected 50/50, now it's 7/3, a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 7/3 split, but I suppose it's a compromise. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 7/3, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""You wanted to be greedy, so I'll give you a chance to be generous. 4/6, it's your turn to compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 4/6 split, which is slightly more favorable to Bob than the original 50/50 split. Let's see if he's willing to make a concession."
