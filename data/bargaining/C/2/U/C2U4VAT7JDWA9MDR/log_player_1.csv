"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the money, and we can go from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is not very generous, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one. The 20% reduction in value due to inflation makes the offer even less appealing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a bit more than before, but I still want a decent share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small consolation prize, but I'm taking the majority. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, and Bob's offer is not very generous.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. $1,000 is not enough, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I want to make sure I get something reasonable. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, with me getting $3,200 and Bob getting $6,800."
