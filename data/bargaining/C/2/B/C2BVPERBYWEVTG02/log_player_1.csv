"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll consider the offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. Splitting it evenly might not be the best option for me, considering the value of money is decreasing over time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share this time, but I think this is still a reasonable offer. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant decrease in the value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll carefully consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as the value of my gain is decreasing rapidly, and $4000 is a relatively good deal at this point."
