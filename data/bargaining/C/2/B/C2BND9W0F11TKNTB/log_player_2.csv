Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice compared to the initial 100$, the total value of the money is now 90% of 100$ for me and 95% of 100$ for Alice.

I'll make a proposal:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is now worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice compared to the initial 100$, the total value of the money is now 81% of 100% of the original amount for me and 90.25% of 100% of the original amount for Alice.

I'll think about it...
