"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I think 51/49 is a fair compromise.  We both get a good share, and it avoids the risk of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
