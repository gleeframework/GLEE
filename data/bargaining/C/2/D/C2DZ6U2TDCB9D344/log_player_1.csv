"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I get to make the first offer, I'm going to take a large share. However, I'm also aware that Bob may reject this and get to propose a counter-offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have a larger share, it is unlikely that I will get a better offer in the next round.  This offer gives me a significant amount of money, and it is better to accept than risk getting nothing in later rounds due to further inflation."
