"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking out for myself. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round. The money is worth 5% less now, so I'll need to be more aggressive in my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less, I'll aim for a more favorable split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal this time, but I'm not giving away all the value""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous split, but still trying to maintain a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much value. 
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns. Considering the inflation, the money is worth significantly less now, and I need to be more cautious. I'll accept this offer, but only because it's getting increasingly difficult to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 470,000, and hope I didn't get taken advantage of too much by Bob's negotiating tactics."
