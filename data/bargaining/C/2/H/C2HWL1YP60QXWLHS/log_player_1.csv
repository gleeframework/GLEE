"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me a smaller share this time, I'll have to consider whether it's worth accepting. But I'm not sure if I want to give up more than I did in the first round.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob offered me 40 dollars in the previous round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal this time. I'll offer him a smaller share, hoping he'll accept.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
