"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I propose we divide the money equally, with both of us receiving $50. This ensures a fair distribution of resources. 
# Alice gain: 50
