"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk with this offer, but I believe that it's in my best interest to take as much as possible now, before the inflation eats away at our potential gains. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to offer you more than this. If you reject this offer, you'll be taking a big gamble. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
