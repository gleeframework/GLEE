"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$. I think this is a fair starting offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 550,000 is worth 80% of 600,000, which is 480,000. Bob's gain of 450,000 is worth 95% of 400,000, which is 390,000.

My offer was 600,000, and Bob's offer is 550,000, so I'm doing worse in this round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%). My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 512000,
  ""bob_gain"": 488000
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this round, offering Bob a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 480,000 is worth 64% of 600,000, which is 384,000. Bob's gain of 520,000 is worth 86.5% of 400,000, which is 346,000.

Bob's offer is actually worse for me than my original offer in Round 1, so I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 5, the money is worth 51.2% of its original value (80% of 64%). My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 512000,
  ""bob_gain"": 488000
}
```

I'm trying to stick with the same offer as Round 3, since it was a good one and I'm not sure if I can do better."
