Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It reflects the time pressure and depreciation rate. It's crucial we reach an agreement now before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200

It's painful to accept an offer where Alice gets more, but consider these factors:

* **Time Pressure:** Only 7 rounds remain.  Waiting gives Alice more leverage to push for an even smaller amount for Bob.
* **Rapid Depreciation:**  The longer the game goes, the less value Bob retains. His depreciation rate is severe.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Her message implies she's firm.  There's a real risk she won't budge further, and Bob gets nothing if it goes to the end.

While not ideal, accepting ensures Bob gets *something*, which is better than the zero outcome if negotiations completely fail.
