Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn. I'll take a little more this time, but it's still a decent deal for you before inflation eats away at your share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less than before, but still more than you offered me 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, but it's still heavily in her favor considering the rapid inflation working against her. By rejecting, I'm hoping she'll get more desperate and offer a larger chunk of the shrinking pie in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, inflation is hitting you hard.  This is a generous offer considering the circumstances. Take it before it's too late!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less, but I'm not desperate yet 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right, she's not desperate yet,  I'm banking on the rapidly decreasing value of the money being a stronger motivator for her.  She's losing value much faster than I am. I'll hold out for a better offer in the next round."
