Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money will be worth less for you in the next round. Let's be reasonable and end this now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's compromise and split the difference from our last offers. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stalling, hoping I'll panic as the deadline approaches.  While the offer seems like a compromise, it's heavily skewed in his favor, especially considering the accelerating inflation eating into my share.  I need to stand firm to secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair offer.  It's time to settle and ensure we both walk away with a good amount, before time runs out for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a slight concession to make the deal more appealing to Bob. However, I'm still aiming for a larger share, reflecting the increasing pressure of inflation on my side. I need to convey a sense of urgency while remaining firm in my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's compromise and split the difference from our last offers. It's time to be reasonable and secure something before the time runs out completely. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough one, and Bob knows it. He's using time pressure and presenting his offer as a reasonable compromise. However, it's the exact same offer *he* rejected in the previous round. This suggests he's getting nervous and trying to lock in a win, even if it's marginally better than before. I need to hold strong for one more round. The inflation is hurting, but giving in now sets a dangerous precedent."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both leave with something substantial. Don't let greed ruin this for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The time for games is over. By offering a 50/50 split, I'm calling Bob's bluff and highlighting the very real risk we both face.  This offer emphasizes fairness and underscores the significant losses we'll both incur if we fail to reach an agreement.  It's a strong play designed to force his hand."
