"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split, with me getting the larger share since I get to propose first. Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's proposal is fair, especially since I'm losing value due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll adjust my proposal to account for the decreased value of my share. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair compromise in these tough economic times!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will consider this a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
