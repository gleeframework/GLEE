"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. Alice's offer isn't very generous, and the impact of inflation will hurt me more than her in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be realistic. This offer is fair considering the inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Countering Greed:**  Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor.  My offer, while still giving her a slight advantage, demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept an unfair deal.
* **Inflation Factor:** I need to secure a decent amount early on because the inflation hurts me more. Waiting too long will drastically reduce the value of my potential gains.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering a bit more than half, I'm hoping to entice Alice to accept. Even with her slower inflation rate, getting slightly more now might be more appealing than risking a worse outcome later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the inflation as leverage, but her offer is barely an improvement from her first one. My offer in round 2 was more reasonable. I need to hold firm and show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal. The longer she waits, the less appealing her slightly larger share will become due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is a fair split, especially with the increasing inflation. Let's end this and both benefit.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  After two rounds of back-and-forth, a clear and straightforward offer is needed. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  A 50/50 split removes any arguments about who is being more greedy and highlights the mutual benefit of a quick agreement.
* **Inflation Pressure:**  The message explicitly reminds Alice that inflation is eating into both their potential gains.  This reinforces the urgency of settling now rather than risking a worse outcome later.

I'm hoping this offer will finally convince Alice to be reasonable."
