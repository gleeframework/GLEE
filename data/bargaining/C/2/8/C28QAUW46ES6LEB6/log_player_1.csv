This is a tough one! Bob is slowly trying to chip away at my gains, knowing that the clock (and inflation) is working against me. However, accepting a 45/55 split now would set a bad precedent and likely lead to even worse offers from him in the future.  I'm hoping he'll start getting nervous soon and offer something more reasonable."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a solution that's more beneficial for both of us. Let's try a 52/48 split, which is closer to my previous offer and more fair considering the declining value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's getting very tight, but I need to hold strong. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage, and accepting this offer would mean I've lost a significant amount of the potential gains.  I'm betting he'll crack under the pressure soon."

{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. 50/50 is the only fair deal at this point.""
}
``` 

This is a risky move, but I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't start making serious concessions.  The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me because of the inflation, but an even split is better than nothing."
