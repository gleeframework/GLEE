"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it since it's a fair split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you can do better 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect a free ride""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. With the inflation rate, the money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
