Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a more even split is fair.  Let's not let the money depreciate too much for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my previous proposal.  The money is losing value with every round.  Let's find a middle ground before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is still a bad deal for Alice.  While the pressure is on, accepting a deal this bad sets a bad precedent for future rounds. It's unlikely Bob would offer anything worse than this in later rounds."
