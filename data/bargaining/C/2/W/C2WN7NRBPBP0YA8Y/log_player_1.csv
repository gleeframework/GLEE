"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively generous share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 20$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is still a relatively small share.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too one-sided, I'd like a fairer share!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, due to inflation, my potential gain is worth 5% less than in round 2. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's make a deal!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more balanced, but still slightly favors me. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, you'll get a tiny share 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. With the money I'd gain being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, 10$ is a very small amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not even a fair share, I need more!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, due to inflation, my potential gain is worth 21.52% less than in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my previous ones, but I'm still trying to get a decent share. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take almost all, you'll get a token 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. With the money I'd gain being worth 22.62% less than in the first round, 1$ is almost nothing.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's ridiculous, I'm not leaving with nothing!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 7, due to inflation, my potential gain is worth 25.88% less than in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 20,
  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up, let's try again!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more realistic, considering the effects of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally end the game."
