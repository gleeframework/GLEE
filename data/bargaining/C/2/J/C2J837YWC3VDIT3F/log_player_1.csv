Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting closer to being acceptable, but it's still early in the game.  While the inflation heavily impacts him, I need to hold out for a better deal for a few more rounds."
