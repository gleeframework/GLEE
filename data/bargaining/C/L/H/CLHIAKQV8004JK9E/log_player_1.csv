"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, and see if we can make a deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to see a slightly more favorable split for me. Let's try to get closer to my original offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and suggesting that we continue the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me again, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the original amount. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I've been generous enough so far. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to add up!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair compromise, considering the current value of the money. I'm willing to accept your offer and end the game.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and I'll take $4,000. It's not the original $8,000 I was hoping for, but it's better than nothing!"
