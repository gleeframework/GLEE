"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This way, we both get a fair share and can see where the negotiations go from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money is worth 10% less this round, I'll consider the actual value of the offer. My gain of 4000 would be worth 4000 * 0.9 = 3600 in the first round's value.

I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, considering he's making the proposal this round. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer. My gain of 3800 would be worth 3800 * 0.729 (1 - 0.271) = 2773 in the first round's value.
