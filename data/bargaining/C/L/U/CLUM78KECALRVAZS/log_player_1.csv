"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split where I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, but I figure I can get a good head start and potentially leave less room for inflation to erode my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, accepting this offer is the best option. Inflation doesn't affect my gains, and if I reject, there's a chance Bob will propose an even worse split in the next round.  Getting 5000 is better than risking getting less later."
