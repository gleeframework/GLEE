"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk to start with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it's tempting to take something,  it's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round. My share might increase if she gets worried about losing it all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering your offer in the previous round. It's a good starting point for a deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice is offering a better deal than the last round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
