"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start losing value due to inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think for a moment... Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a pretty good one for me, as my share is still worth the same, but Bob's share is worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'll accept his offer.
