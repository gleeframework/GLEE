This is a tough one!  While getting a slightly better split would be ideal, here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money significantly decreases for Alice. We're past the halfway point, and she's likely feeling the pressure. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a 60/40 split might not be worth the risk of getting nothing if Alice becomes desperate. A 50/50 split is still a decent outcome considering the circumstances. 
* **Unpredictability:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better than this. She might become more stubborn, especially if she's playing on the principle of fairness. 

Let's take the sure thing and split the money evenly!"
