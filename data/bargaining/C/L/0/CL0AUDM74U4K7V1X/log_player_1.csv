I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 40/60 split. I was hoping for a more even split, especially since the money is worth less now. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding out for a decent chunk myself."
