"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I came down from 60, you need to come up from 45. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

Let's see if Bob accepts this time. I'm applying a bit of pressure with that ""final offer"" statement to encourage him to settle."
