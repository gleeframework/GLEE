"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can negotiate further if you want. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 1000$ is better than nothing, it's a very lopsided deal. It's worth seeing if I can get a better offer, especially since the money is losing value with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40. It's still a good deal for me, and it gives you more than the last offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 4000$ is better than the previous offer, it's still a significant imbalance. The inflation is hurting Alice more, and with each round, her offers will likely become more favorable to me. I'm willing to risk it and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the previous offer. I think 60/40 is fair, given the inflation and how we've both rejected previous offers. It's time for a compromise.""}
```"
