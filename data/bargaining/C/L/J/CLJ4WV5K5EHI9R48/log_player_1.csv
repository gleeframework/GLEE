"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob is interested in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'll give you a better deal next time if you don't accept now! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me now, I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially with the promise of a ""better deal"" next time. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this round!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a 55/45 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll stick to my original offer, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my thinking. However, Bob is sticking to his original offer, and I don't think it's a good deal for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal, but I'm not willing to accept a 45/55 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 37.1% less than in the first round, I need to be even more cautious with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try again with a 50/50 split, Bob. No strings attached!""
}
```

I'm going back to a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finally divide the money."
