"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is a classic ultimatum game. I'm proposing a split of 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob.  While it might seem unfair, it's important to remember that if Bob rejects this offer, the money will be worth less in the next round, making my offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a risky move, but I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** While my offer has decreased in value, Bob's is even more devalued (20% vs 10%). This means I have more leverage in the next round.
* **My Next Offer:** I can offer Bob slightly less than 300,000, and it's still likely to be more valuable to him than what I'm being offered now.  This is because he will lose another 20% on his potential gains.

It's a gamble, but I'm betting that Bob will want to avoid a situation where he's constantly losing value."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm offering Bob 550,000, which is still a significant amount, even after the inflation from the previous round.  I'm confident this will be more appealing to him than waiting another round and potentially getting even less due to the 20% devaluation of his money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting interesting.  While Bob's offer is still a significant amount, I'm going to reject it for the following reasons:

* **Significant Inflation:**  Bob's money is now worth almost half of what it was initially! This means my potential gains in the next round are even more appealing.
* **My Leverage:**  Even if Bob keeps rejecting offers, he's still losing a large amount of value each round. I can make a counteroffer in the next round that is slightly less than what he's offering now, but still more attractive to him due to the inflation.

The risk is that Bob might be stubborn and continue to reject offers. But the potential reward for me is so high that I'm willing to take that risk."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000}
```

This is a slightly lower offer than Bob's last one, but considering the significant inflation he's facing, it's likely still more valuable to him. 

I'm banking on the fact that he doesn't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. If he rejects, my next offer will be even lower, but his potential gains will be even more diminished."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly lower than what I've been hoping for, the inflation has made it a difficult decision.

* **Inflation:**  Bob's money is worth less than two-thirds of what it was initially. My potential gains in the next round are also heavily impacted by inflation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Bob might continue to lower his offer, and I might end up with even less.  It's a risky proposition to keep rejecting.

Considering these factors, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's not ideal, but it's better than risking further losses."
