"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'll try to get a better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60:40 split being rejected, but I'm willing to negotiate.

Considering the inflation effect, I'm not too keen on the 30:70 split proposed by Bob. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing a 45:55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still a bit more favorable to me than his previous offer. I'm hoping this compromise will be more acceptable to Bob."
