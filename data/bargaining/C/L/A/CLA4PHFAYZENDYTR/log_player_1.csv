"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, it's only fair!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll consider the effective amounts.

Alice gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36
Bob gain: 60 * 0.95 = 57

I'll accept this offer.
