"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm taking the lion's share. But I'm leaving some room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's a significant improvement from the last round, I believe I can still secure a better deal. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired split.  Let's see what he offers in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering an 80/20 split.  I'm willing to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe this is a fair split given the inflation dynamic. Let's see if Bob is ready to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Inflation is starting to bite, and while I'd prefer a larger share, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  70/30 is a good outcome for me, given the circumstances."
