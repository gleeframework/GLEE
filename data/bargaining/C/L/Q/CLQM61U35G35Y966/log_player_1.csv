I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since the money will be worth less in the next round, it's in my best interest to get a larger share now.  However, I'm also trying to be fair and give Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is a good outcome. The inflation factor means that taking a smaller share now is better than risking a lower payout in the future."
