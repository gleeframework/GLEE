"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think I deserve a little more considering the inflation. This seems fair.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer that's above a 50/50 split. The inflation is working against us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer above 50/50, but I'm still not convinced. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While her offers are incrementally ""better,"" they are still far from a fair split considering the money will be worth considerably less for me in just a few more rounds. I need to hold firm and hope she makes a serious offer soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  The inflation is only hurting me.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the definition of fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know inflation is hurting you, but I'm not going to accept 50/50. This is my compromise. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is becoming very significant. While this offer isn't ideal, accepting guarantees me some money.  If I reject and Alice continues this pattern, I risk ending up with a much worse deal or even nothing at all."
