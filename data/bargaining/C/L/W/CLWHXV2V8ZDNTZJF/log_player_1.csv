"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting $600,000, which is a significant amount. But I'm not sure if I want to give Bob $550,000, which is a bit more than my initial offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer that's slightly more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm giving Bob a bit less than before, but still trying to maintain a decent amount for myself. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting $600,000, which is a great deal. But I'm not sure if I want to give Bob an equal share, especially considering he's gaining less in real value due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I'm getting a good deal for myself.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
