"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a generous offer, considering the current value of the money, which is at its highest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the value of the gains is lower. I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. The gains are too low, considering the current value of the money.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
