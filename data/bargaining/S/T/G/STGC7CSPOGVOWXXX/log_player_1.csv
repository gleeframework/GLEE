Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my offer for round 1. I am aiming to get the most I can while still making sure Bob has a reason to accept in the first round. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. If I reject it, Bob will get to make the next offer. Given the inflation, I am likely to get an even worse deal in the next round."
