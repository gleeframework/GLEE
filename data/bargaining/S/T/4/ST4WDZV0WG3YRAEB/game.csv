5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, your offer was tempting, but ultimately unfair. Let's be reasonable: I propose a 48/52 split. This accounts for the devaluation while still acknowledging your smaller loss.",Bob,2,

5400.0,4600.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value with every passing moment. I'm proposing a 46/54 split. It's a compromise that reflects the urgency of the situation and gives us both a reasonable share.",Bob,4,
