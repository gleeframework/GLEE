"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive start, hoping to secure a large share early on. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial proposal, even after accounting for inflation. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my proposed gain, but still aiming for a majority share. This should be a more appealing offer to Bob, especially considering the inflation impacting his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, the inflation is starting to seriously erode the value of the money for both of us.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least some of the money, and it's the best I can expect given the circumstances."
