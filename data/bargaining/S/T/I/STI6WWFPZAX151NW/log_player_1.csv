I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the reduced value of money, I'm not sure if 45% is a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is plummeting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the reduced value of money, 40% seems like a relatively small share, but I don't want to give up too much more. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take 40% and call it a day. Let's finalize the deal.""
}
