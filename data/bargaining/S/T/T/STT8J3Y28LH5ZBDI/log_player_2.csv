"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible offer for Bob.  While it's better than nothing, Bob should reject and see if Alice will offer anything more reasonable.  There are 11 more rounds, and the money will be worth less and less each time, so there's time for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair split. I propose Bob gets 90% and Alice gets 10%. I believe this is a good starting point that acknowledges the value of a collaborative approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a very lopsided deal. While the offer is slightly better than Round 1, it's still not a fair or reasonable split. Bob should continue to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate more fairly. There are still plenty of rounds left, and Bob's position will only get stronger as the value of the money decreases further with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 80% for Bob and 20% for Alice. This shows a willingness to compromise, while still maintaining a significant share for myself.  I believe this is a more fair and equitable proposition than the previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still very unfair, even though it's slightly better than the previous round.  The inflation is starting to hit, but Bob should continue to push for a more equitable split. There are still many rounds left, and Bob's bargaining power will only increase as the money becomes less valuable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to go down to 70% for Bob, but this is a significant concession, considering the diminishing value of the money.  I believe this offer is a reasonable compromise, reflecting the value of both cooperation and the increasing pressure of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still very lopsided, even with the increasing inflation.  Bob should continue to reject these offers and see if Alice will come to a more fair and equitable agreement. There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob's position will continue to improve as the value of the money decreases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

The inflation is getting serious, but I'm sticking to my principles.  60% for Bob and 40% for Alice is still a fair deal, considering the circumstances.  I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be taken advantage of."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not fair. The inflation is getting serious, but Bob should keep rejecting these offers and see if Alice will come to a more reasonable agreement. There are still a few rounds left, and Bob's position will continue to strengthen as the value of the money decreases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

The pressure is on, but I'm standing firm.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option given the circumstances.  Inflation is taking its toll, but I believe this offer is a reasonable compromise, given the diminishing value of the money and the urgency of reaching an agreement."
