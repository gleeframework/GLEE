"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll see it as a good starting point and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and splitting it evenly seems like a fair compromise.

I accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
