"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, with me taking a slightly larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's fair and we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I initially offered Bob $45 and he rejected it, and now he's offering me $50, it seems like a good deal for me. However, considering the game's dynamics and the fact that Bob's share will be worth less in future rounds, I might be able to get a better deal if I wait. But, to avoid the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within the 12 rounds, I'll accept this offer to ensure I get a decent share.
