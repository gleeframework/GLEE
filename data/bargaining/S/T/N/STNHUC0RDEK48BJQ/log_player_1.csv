"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 80% of the original amount. Fair and square?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but still leaving you with a good amount. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too uneven for me. I'd like to try to get a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60% of the remaining amount. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining $4,000."
