{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this round. I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation will benefit you more in later rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find some middle ground. How about a 55/45 split? This accounts for the inflation working in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
