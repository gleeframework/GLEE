"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer to Bob for the first round:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects a fair advantage for me in the early stages.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split considering the potential for inflation. Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's see how the inflation plays out over a few more rounds. Bob's offer isn't drastically worse than mine, but I'm willing to bet he'll become more generous as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer to Bob for Round 3:

```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This split acknowledges the inflation factor but still gives me a slight edge.""}
```"
