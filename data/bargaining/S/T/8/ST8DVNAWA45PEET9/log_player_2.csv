"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I take 90% and you get 10%, but we can adjust as we go. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's offer is not fair, and I believe we can find a more balanced division. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a more reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, we should try to reach an agreement quickly. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and avoid losing more value to inflation.""}"
