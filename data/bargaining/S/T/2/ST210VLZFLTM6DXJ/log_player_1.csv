"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 10% and let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $100,000. This leaves me with $900,000. My message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate and take the remaining 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $900,000 in Round 1 is now worth $855,000 (95% of $900,000).

Considering Bob's offer in Round 2, I'll calculate the actual values:

* My gain: $500,000
* Bob's gain: $500,000

I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer. Since I'm already down to $855,000 from the initial $900,000, I'd rather not give up more money. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation adjustment, my gain of $855,000 from the previous round is now worth $808,250 (95% of $855,000).

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,

}
```
