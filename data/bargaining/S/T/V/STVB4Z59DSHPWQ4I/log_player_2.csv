Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Analyze the current situation
We are in Round 6 of the game. Alice and I, Bob, have been making offers and counteroffers to divide $10,000. So far, neither of us has accepted the other's offer.

### Step 2: Review previous offers
Alice initially offered a 50/50 split. I rejected it, thinking I could get a better deal. I then offered $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Alice, which she rejected. Alice's subsequent offers have been compromises between our positions, but I've rejected them, aiming for a better split.

### Step 3: Consider the game's progression and remaining rounds
We have 6 rounds left before we both get nothing. The pressure to reach an agreement increases as the rounds progress.

### Step 4: Determine the next offer
Given the pattern of offers and the increasing pressure, my next offer should be slightly more generous than my previous one but still favor me. I will offer $5,700 for myself and $4,300 for Alice.

### Step 5: Craft the message
The message should reflect the slight concession while emphasizing my belief that this is a fairer split. ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more. This seems like a fairer split, don't you think?""

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 5700, ""alice_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more. This seems like a fairer split, don't you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I think this is the best deal I'll get from Alice, considering the time pressure and her emphasis that this is her final offer.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
