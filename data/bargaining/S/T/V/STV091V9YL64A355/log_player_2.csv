"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
Bob should reject this offer. While $100,000 is a decent amount, it's better to wait and see if he can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
 
Bob should propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer that maximizes Bob's potential gain in the first round while still being reasonable enough that Alice might accept it."
