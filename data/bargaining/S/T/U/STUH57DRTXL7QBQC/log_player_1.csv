"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose taking $999,000 and giving Bob $1,000.  I figure he'll be happy to get anything at all in the first round, and it leaves me with the lion's share.  Let's see if he agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

 While I'd like to get more, it's better to accept Bob's offer now than risk getting nothing at all."
