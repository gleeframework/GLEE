Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a simple split. I propose I take $6,000 and you get $4,000.  It's important to reach an agreement quickly before inflation eats away at the value.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to start with a more even split. Let's try $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid losing too much to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
