Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split. I propose I take $6,000 and you get $4,000.  It's important to reach an agreement quickly before inflation eats away at the value.

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a more even split, but we need to be mindful of the dwindling value. Let's settle this now. I'll take $5,700, you take $4,300.  This is a fair deal considering time is working against us. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700
