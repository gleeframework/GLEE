**Reasoning:**

Even though the money is losing value, Alice is still trying to hold onto a significantly larger share. We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and it's time to push for a more equitable split.  Holding out a bit longer might make Alice more amenable to a 50/50 split, or close to it, as the pressure of losing everything increases."
