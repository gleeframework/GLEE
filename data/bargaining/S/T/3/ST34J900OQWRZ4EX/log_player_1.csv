Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm willing to split the money evenly, but I'll take a slightly larger share to account for the higher inflation rate you're facing. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
