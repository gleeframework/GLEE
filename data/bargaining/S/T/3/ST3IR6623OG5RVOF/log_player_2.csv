Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""My turn to propose a fair deal. This ensures we both benefit from ending quickly.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:** Delaying is worse for me (20% inflation) than Alice (5% inflation).  I need to incentivize a quick resolution.
* **Fairness:**  While I want to maximize my share, a wildly uneven offer will likely be rejected. A slightly favorable split is more likely to be accepted.
* **Strategy:**  By offering slightly more than what Alice would get if she rejected and won in the next round (considering the 5% decrease in value for her), I'm making acceptance more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Negative Trend:** Alice's offer is getting worse for me.  She's likely betting on my fear of inflation to force a bad deal.
* **Future Leverage:**  If I reject again, I'll be in the proposing seat, which gives me more control over the next offer.
* **Calculation:**  While the money is decreasing in value, accepting 420,000 now isn't significantly better than hoping for a better offer in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's end this now with a perfectly fair 50/50 split. No more delays, no more losses!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** The inflation is hurting me significantly more than Alice. Every round that passes makes a bad deal more likely. A quick resolution is now crucial.
* **Shifting Power:** Alice's offers are getting progressively worse, indicating she might be overplaying her hand. A strong, fair offer could make her reconsider her position.
* **Simplicity:** A 50/50 split is the easiest to understand and agree on. It removes the need for complex calculations and potential disagreements. 

By offering a fair and simple split, I hope to incentivize Alice to end the game now rather than risk further losses for both of us due to inflation."
