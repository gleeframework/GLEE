"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you can have the remaining 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a good starting point, but 10% is too little. I want to see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can agree on that!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move closer to your offer.  How about a 65/35 split?  We can each get a little more this way. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. While a 60/40 split would be ideal, getting 35% is a decent gain, especially with inflation affecting the money."
