"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively fair offer considering the rules of the game. Since the value of money decreases more significantly for me (20% each round) than for Bob (5% each round), I'm inclined to take a bit more to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds. However, the offer still leaves room for negotiation and is reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting, especially since the total amount will decrease in value over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer leaves us both with a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, accepting $45 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a lower offer in the first round due to the 20% decrease in value for me. Additionally, Bob's loss due to inflation is significantly less (5%), so I believe there's room for a more favorable offer for me, especially since we're still early in the game. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nGiven the effects of inflation, my goal is to find a middle ground that takes into account the loss of value for both of us, but particularly for me since I'm losing more value per round. By offering $57 for myself and $43 for Bob, I'm attempting to balance the scales a bit, recognizing that Bob's share is decreasing in value at a slower rate. This offer is slightly more favorable to me than the previous ones but still leaves room for negotiation. It also puts pressure on Bob to consider the diminishing value of the money over time and the risk of ending up with less if the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is eating our money! Let's split it evenly before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, accepting an even split at this point seems like the most rational decision. The diminishing value of the money over time, especially at the rate it's decreasing for me, means that holding out for a slightly better offer could result in actually getting less value in the long run. Bob's offer to split the money evenly is fair, especially considering the pressure of future rounds reducing the value even further. It's better to secure $50 now, which, despite the decrease in value, remains a tangible gain rather than risking a further decrease in value in subsequent rounds."
