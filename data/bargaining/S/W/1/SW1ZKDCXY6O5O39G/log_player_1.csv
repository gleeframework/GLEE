"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's speed things up. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. The money may be worth less now, but I think I can get a better deal than $4,500, especially considering Bob's message implies he's open to negotiating. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation""}\n\nI'm offering to take $5,800 and leave $4,200 for Bob. Since the money is worth less now, I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both accept. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation and Bob's message stating this is his final offer, I think it's best to accept this deal. $4,800 is still a substantial amount, and the risk of losing everything if we don't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds is too high. I'll take the safe route and accept the offer."
