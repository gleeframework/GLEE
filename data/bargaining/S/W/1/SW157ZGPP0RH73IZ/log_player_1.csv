"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic example of the Ultimatum Game.  I'm going to propose a very unequal split in favor of myself. Since Bob has to accept this offer or we go to the next round, I am hoping he will accept it. In the next round, it would be his turn to make the proposal, and I would be free to reject any unfair split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more money, it's better to get something than nothing. I realize that if I reject this offer, we will continue the game. There is no guarantee that I will get a better offer in the future. It's smarter to accept this offer and get $1,000,000 than to risk getting nothing."
