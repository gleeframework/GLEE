"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the high ground, let's see if you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With the 5% decrease, my gain would be worth $475,000 (500,000 x 0.95). Bob's gain, on the other hand, would be worth $480,000 (600,000 x 0.8).

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll try to do better in the next round!"
