**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting longer means significantly less money for both of us.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair. While I believe my contributions deserve slightly more, holding out for a better offer might result in us both losing out entirely. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 8 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly with every rejection."
