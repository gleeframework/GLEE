"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair share for both""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Fair share for both"" is intended to convey that I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation will affect us both differently. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better split. The fact that the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each round puts more pressure on him to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I'll try to leverage this to my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that slightly adjusts from the original, considering the inflation but also trying to maintain a strong negotiating position. Given that Bob showed willingness to offer me 4500 in the previous round, I will adjust my offer to be closer to that, but still in my favor, taking into account the pressure of inflation on both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nThis offer aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us, but more significantly for him. The message is designed to appeal to the need for a compromise that suits both parties, given the circumstances."
