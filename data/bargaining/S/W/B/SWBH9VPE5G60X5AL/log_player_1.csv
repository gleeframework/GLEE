Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with an even split, as it seems the fairest way to divide the money. I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is hitting me hard. I'm accepting the offer to avoid risking getting nothing at all."
