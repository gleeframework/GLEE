"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money, Bob. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept a 40/60 split, especially with the inflation factor. I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable, Alice.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like you're feeling the inflation pinch. This offer reflects the changing value of the money over time. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I still feel like I can get a better deal. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm not ready to accept a 45/55 split yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. We're both losing value with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to avoid further losses. What do you say?""}
