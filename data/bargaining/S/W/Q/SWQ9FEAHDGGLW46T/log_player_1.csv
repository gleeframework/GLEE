This is a tough one! While ideally, I'd want more, the inflation is working strongly against me.  Bob is clearly playing hardball and knows the longer this goes on, the more desperate I'll become. Accepting 4000 now is better than risking getting even less later, or even nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
