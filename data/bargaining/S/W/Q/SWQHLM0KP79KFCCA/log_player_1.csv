I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly.  I'm assuming Bob will want to accept this since he's getting something, but if he rejects it, I'll have to be more generous in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm increasing his share slightly.  However, I'm still keeping the majority as the inflation will start to affect my earnings significantly."
