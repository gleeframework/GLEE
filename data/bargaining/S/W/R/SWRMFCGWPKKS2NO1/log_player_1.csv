"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 7:3 is a more reasonable ratio considering the current value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
