"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. It's a good starting point, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 300,000$ is now worth 240,000$ (80% of 300,000$), and Bob's gain of 700,000$ is worth 665,000$ (95% of 700,000$).

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is a good idea, as it seems Bob is getting a larger share. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the large difference in our shares. I'd like to propose a revised offer that brings our shares closer together.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of 300,000$ is now worth 240,000$ (80% of 300,000$), and Bob's gain of 700,000$ is worth 665,000$ (95% of 700,000$).

I'll make a new offer, trying to bring the shares closer together.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 420k is a fair amount for me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is the maximum I'm willing to give. Let's see if you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 350,000$ is now worth 182,400$ (51.2% of 350,000$, since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%).

Bob's gain of 650,000$ is now worth 557,150$ (85.74% of 650,000$, since 100% - 14.26% = 85.74%).

I'm still not comfortable with the large difference in our shares, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is the maximum you're willing to give. I'd like to propose a revised offer that brings our shares even closer together.""
