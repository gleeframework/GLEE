Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation affects you, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This takes into account the changing value and gives us both a reasonable deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
