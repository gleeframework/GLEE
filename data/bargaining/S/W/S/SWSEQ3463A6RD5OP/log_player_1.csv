# Bob's message: I'm going for a slightly larger share, but I'm confident we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'm looking for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.
