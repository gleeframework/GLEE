"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can reassess if we don't like it""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $200,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $190,000. Bob's share of $800,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $720,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'll consider it. I'm not getting a great deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round if I can get a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a better deal. I'll offer a slightly larger share to Bob, hoping he'll accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a fair share""
}
```"
