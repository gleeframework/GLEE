"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide it fairly, considering the inflation, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to push for a more equitable split, especially considering the money loses value with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""My turn - let's split the difference a bit more evenly, factoring in the inflation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:**  While I want to maximize my share, I recognize that an extremely lopsided offer will likely be rejected. This offer is slightly more generous than a straight 50/50 split to account for the inflation Bob experiences.
* **Time Pressure:** It's only round 2, but the clock is ticking. I want to reach a deal sooner rather than later to avoid further devaluation of the money. 
* **Setting a Tone:** This offer signals to Alice that I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to simply accept a heavily skewed offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Think about it! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer has slightly improved, but it's still not good enough. While she claims it's more generous, the reality is that the decreasing value of the money means I'm losing even more with each round. I need to push for a better split while there's still time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out - a 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to reach a deal.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With each round, the deal is getting worse for me due to inflation. A 50/50 split, while not ideal at this point, guarantees me a reasonable amount of the original sum. 
* **Simplicity and Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently easy to understand and presents a strong case for fairness.  
* **Pressure on Alice:**  By offering an even split, I'm putting the pressure on Alice. If she rejects this, it suggests she's being unreasonable and risks both of us walking away with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value each round, I'm being generous by not dropping my offer further. Take it! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is using the inflation to her advantage, trying to scare me into a bad deal. However, her offer is getting worse! Holding out and proposing a reasonable counter-offer is still the better strategy, as accepting this offer would mean a significant loss compared to even a 50/50 split. I'm banking on Alice being rational and realizing that getting a smaller share is better than nothing if we reach the final round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer reflects the time pressure and the fact that I'm losing money with every round we waste.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm slightly increasing my initial offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate.  However, I'm still aiming for a share that accounts for the inflation.
* **Direct Communication:** My message clearly reiterates the time pressure and the impact of inflation.  I want to make sure Alice understands these factors are non-negotiable and influence my decision-making.
* **Calculated Risk:**  There's a risk Alice might interpret this as desperation and further decrease her offer. However, I believe this offer presents a good balance between firmness and a willingness to compromise, which is crucial as we enter the later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time and money, I'm not budging much. This is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, as the pressure is definitely on. However, Alice's offer is getting progressively worse, not better.  She's clearly trying to exploit the situation and pressure me into a terrible deal. I need to hold my ground a bit longer and hope she starts negotiating more realistically. Accepting 35% of the pot at this stage would be a significant loss, especially when a 50/50 split was on the table earlier."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. We're running out of time. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  We're entering the endgame now. With only four rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is very real.  
* **Firmness:** By returning to a 50/50 split, I'm signaling to Alice that this is my final offer. I'm not going to negotiate against myself any further, especially given the inflation working against me.
* **Appeal to Logic:**  My message emphasizes fairness and the reality of the situation.  Alice can't ignore the time pressure any longer, and this offer ensures we both benefit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing a lot of value each round, and I'm not going to give in. Take this offer before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is incredibly frustrating, but with only three rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing is too high. Alice is clearly playing hardball and banking on my desperation as the inflation eats away at the potential gains. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, which is better than walking away empty-handed after the 12th round. 

While it's not the outcome I wanted, I need to be pragmatic.  Alice has leverage due to the game's mechanics, and she's exploiting it effectively."
