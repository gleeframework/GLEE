"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 999,999 dollars, leaving 1 dollar for Bob. This is a very aggressive start, aiming to secure the vast majority of the money.  However, since the inflation rate is unknown and Bob is likely to be aware of this game theory scenario, he may be willing to wait and propose in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I initially aimed for a much larger share, the 5% inflation on Bob's offer means a significant reduction in his potential gains. Accepting this 50/50 split is the most rational decision.  Waiting for another round risks further inflation, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to secure a better deal in the future."
