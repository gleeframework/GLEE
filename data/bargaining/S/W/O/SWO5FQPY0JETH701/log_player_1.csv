Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit unfair. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll take $55, leaving you with $45.  This accounts for the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
