"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering we both want to get a decent share.  Let's agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I was hoping to get a bit more, considering I was willing to start with a 60/40 split in the first round. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal. This is my best offer.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer."
