"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 20% inflation rate is high, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get more than $3000."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Let's compromise. Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting you harder than me, Bob. I suggest we settle this quickly. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3300 
# Alice gain: 6700 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, Alice's offer of $3300, although not ideal, becomes more appealing as the rounds progress. With each round, the value of the money I could gain decreases substantially (now 36% less than the initial round), making the risk of holding out for a better offer less advantageous. Given Alice's message suggesting this is her final offer and the decreasing value of the money, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable decision to secure a share of the $10,000 before its value diminishes further."
