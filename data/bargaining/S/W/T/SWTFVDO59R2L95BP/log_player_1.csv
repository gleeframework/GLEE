"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves a significant amount for Bob.  It also sets up a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. While this is less than my initial offer, it accounts for the inflation and Bob's increased share in the previous round.  I believe this is a fair offer that acknowledges the changing value of the money while still securing a good amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is better than the previous round, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I'm receiving.  I will continue to negotiate for a more equitable split, even if it means we go further into the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Given the significant inflation we've both experienced, I believe this is the fairest solution. It allows us both to gain a reasonable amount after accounting for the decreased value of the money."
