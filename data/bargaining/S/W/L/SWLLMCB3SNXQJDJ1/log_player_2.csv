"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the diminishing value of the money over time. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed for my liking. Let's be realistic about the time pressure, but also fair. How about this?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and the value keeps shrinking, especially for you.  This offer is a compromise, let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show firmness to get a more reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about finding a fair split, but I won't be lowballed. This offer is my bottom line for this round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair but firm. This offer is a good balance considering the time pressure and the shrinking value. Let's not risk losing it all. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This offer is even worse than her previous one, showing she's not negotiating in good faith. I need to hold firm, even though the inflation is really starting to bite. It's risky, but accepting a bad deal sets a bad precedent for the rest of the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a reasonable compromise, considering the time pressure we both face.  Take it or leave it, but this is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is frustrating for you. I'm offering you the same amount I initially rejected in round 2. Let's settle this now before the value diminishes further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me. While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting Alice's offer is now the best move for maximizing my potential gain. It's still better than what the inflated value will be if I continue to reject and risk getting nothing."
