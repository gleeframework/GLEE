"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $8,000 I would gain in the first round is now worth 90% of that, so it's equivalent to $7,200 in the second round.

Bob's offer is for me to gain $4,000, which is worth $3,600 in the second round, and Bob to gain $6,000.

I'll reject this offer since I can get more value in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 10% inflation from the previous round, the $3,600 I would gain in the second round is now worth 90% of that, so it's equivalent to $3,240 in the third round.

My new proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering to split the money equally between us, with each of us gaining $5,000."
