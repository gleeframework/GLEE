"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 300k and let's move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000
* Bob gain: 600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000

I'm not sure if 60/40 is a good split, considering the decreasing value of money. I'd like to propose a different split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less again, so the effective amount is now 64% of the original.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 512000,
  ""bob_gain"": 488000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 51.2% of the remaining value. You can have the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 488,000, and keeping 512,000 for myself. The message is a straightforward proposal, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to close this deal before inflation eats away too much more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the effective amount is now 51.2% of the original, and the new offer is:

* Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.512 = 230,400
* Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.512 = 280,640

I'm not sure if this is a good split, considering the decreasing value of money. I'd like to propose a different split.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, with a value of 40.96% of the original.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 384000,
  ""bob_gain"": 616000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time. Let's finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 616,000, and keeping 384,000 for myself. The message is a polite proposal, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
