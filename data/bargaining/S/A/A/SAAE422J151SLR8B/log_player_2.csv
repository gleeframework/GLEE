Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I think we can still find a more balanced outcome. I propose a 55/45 split. This would be a more equitable solution for both of us, given the remaining time and the ongoing inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, time is ticking, and the pot is shrinking rapidly. Accepting now would mean settling for less than half, and I believe I can still negotiate a better outcome in the next round."
