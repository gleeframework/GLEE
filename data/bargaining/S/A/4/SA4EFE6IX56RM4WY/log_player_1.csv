"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a fairly even split, with a slight bias in my favor to account for the fact that the money is worth more to me in the first round. I'll also include a friendly message to Bob to try to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be more efficient with the split 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, even though the money is worth less to me in this round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer is the opposite of my initial proposal, with a bias in his favor. I'll try to counter with a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll try to find a middle ground between our previous offers. I'll propose a split that is closer to 50/50, but still slightly in my favor to account for the decreasing value of the money. My message to Bob will emphasize the idea of compromise and meeting in the middle, in the hopes that he will be more willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Let's avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think Bob's offer is reasonable. The difference between our gains is relatively small, and further rounds would only lead to more loss of value. Since Bob has framed this as his final offer and emphasized the importance of avoiding further inflation, I believe it's the best deal I can get at this point. I'll accept his offer to secure the 470,000."
