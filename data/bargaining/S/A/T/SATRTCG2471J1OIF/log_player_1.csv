Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. While I understand the risk of inflation, I believe a more balanced split is fair, especially since I am the one taking the risk of you rejecting this offer and moving to another round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
