Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my diminishing returns. While the offer is getting closer to something more acceptable, I still believe I can get a better deal in the next few rounds.  The rate of inflation is slowing, and I need to push for a larger share before it becomes too detrimental."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be fair. 50/50, take it or leave it.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, be wise 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice is right, inflation is hurting my position. However, accepting this offer means I lose almost half the value compared to the start.  There's still a chance Alice will offer a better deal as we get closer to the deadline and she risks getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a decent compromise, and we're running out of time!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing significantly. I need to make a move that is still somewhat advantageous to me but enticing enough for Alice to accept. This offer shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a reasonable share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a brutal offer, but I have to be realistic. We are down to the wire, and Alice knows I'm desperate. If I reject this, she's likely to offer me even less in the next round, and there's a real chance we both end up with nothing.  While this deal heavily favors Alice, taking $3,000 is better than losing everything."
