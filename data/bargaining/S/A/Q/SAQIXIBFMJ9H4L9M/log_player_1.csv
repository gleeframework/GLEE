"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me a slightly larger share of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a larger share to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth much less now, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. However, I'm not sure if 58 is enough.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get at this point.
