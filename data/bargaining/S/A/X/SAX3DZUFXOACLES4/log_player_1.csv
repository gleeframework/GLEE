I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm going for a big chunk initially, hoping Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair offer considering the inflation.  It's better than getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement!"
