"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good start. 
# Bob gain: 400000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While 400,000 is a decent starting point, I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering the value of the money decreases each round for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe 60-40 is a fairer split, reflecting the risk of the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is offering more than the 400,000 I originally proposed. With the decreasing value of money, it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
