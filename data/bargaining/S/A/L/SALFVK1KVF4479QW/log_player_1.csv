Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my 60/40 offer.  It's a fair compromise given the inflation affecting both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm, but the deal is getting worse for us rapidly due to inflation. While a 50/50 split would be ideal, it's becoming increasingly unlikely Bob will agree. We need to incentivize him to settle sooner rather than later.  We'll counter with a less appealing offer for him, hoping the ticking clock will push him to accept."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still confident in my offer.  The longer we wait, the less both of us will get. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is digging in, but time is becoming a serious factor. We need to make him a deal he can't refuse to avoid a total loss in the later rounds. It's a risk, but we're running out of time for a more favorable outcome."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be real. 50/50. Take it or leave it. We're both losing money here.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to go all-in.  Offering a 50/50 split might seem risky, but it's the most logical choice at this stage.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains. We need to force a decision quickly.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob has been unwilling to budge, suggesting he values securing a deal over maximizing his share in the face of a dwindling pot.
* **Minimizing Losses:** A 50/50 split, while not ideal, guarantees us something rather than risking a total loss if we continue to haggle."
