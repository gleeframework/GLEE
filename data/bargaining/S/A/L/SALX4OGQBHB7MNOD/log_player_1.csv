"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have it all, let's start with a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much! I'll give you 45, and I'll take 55.""}

I'm hoping Bob will consider my counteroffer and we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle! 50-50 split, a fair compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will see the value in finding a middle ground."
