I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to secure a good portion of the money while it's still worth the most.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a real threat.  Accepting this offer guarantees me at least half the money, even with the 5% devaluation.  It's a safer bet than risking further rounds and potential losses."
