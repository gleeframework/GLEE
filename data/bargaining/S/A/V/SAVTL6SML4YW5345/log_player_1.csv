"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. The message is ""Let's be fair"", trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and hoping he'll accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This round is my best offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each round, he may be more willing to compromise as the game goes on. Additionally, Bob's message seems like a bluff, trying to make me believe this is his best offer, but I'm not convinced. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself. The message is ""Let's meet in the middle"", trying to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Since Bob's previous offer was $4500 for me, I'm trying to nudge him a bit closer to my desired amount while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because I still think I can get a better deal. Bob's message claims this is his final offer, but I'm not convinced. With the money being worth 27.1% less for Bob than in the first round, he has a strong incentive to settle for a less favorable deal rather than risk getting nothing. I'll wait for the next round to see if Bob will crack under the pressure of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Don't let inflation eat away your share""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4400 and keep $5600 for myself. The message is ""Don't let inflation eat away your share"", trying to remind Bob that the longer he waits, the less valuable his share becomes due to inflation. I'm hoping this will create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is fair and simple. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer because it's finally a fair split, and considering the inflation, Bob is actually losing more value than me. The message seems sincere, and I believe Bob is willing to settle for an equal split to avoid losing out entirely. With the inflation rate increasing, it's likely that future offers will be less favorable, so I'll take the safe bet and accept this offer.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
