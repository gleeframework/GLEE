**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While the offer is getting closer to something acceptable, I need to show I'm serious and willing to risk it all to get a fair deal.  I'm hoping this continued pressure will push her to offer a larger amount in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is fair and simple. Let's end this before we both lose out.""} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is the most straightforward and fair deal.  By now, Alice should see I'm willing to risk everything for a reasonable split. Offering anything less than this at this stage risks losing everything to inflation."
