"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better!  üòâ 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Considering the inflation rates, the effective values are:

* My gain: $100,000 (initially $100,000) is now worth $80,000 (20% less)
* Bob's gain: $900,000 (initially $900,000) is now worth $810,000 (10% less)

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not favorable to me, I'll try to make a more balanced offer in Round 3. Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth 20% and 10% less for me and Bob, respectively.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a decent balance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground, Alice!  ü§ù 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to mirror my previous offer, but with a slight twist.

Let's calculate the effective values considering the inflation rates:

* My gain: $300,000 (initially $700,000) is now worth $181,200 (48.8% less)
* Bob's gain: $700,000 (initially $300,000) is now worth $254,700 (27.1% less)

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as it's still not very favorable to me. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not favorable to me, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer in Round 5. Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth 48.8% and 27.1% less for me and Bob, respectively.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping to create a more balanced deal."
