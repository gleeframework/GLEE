,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'll be the one making the proposal next round.  Let's keep it simple and see how you feel about this.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob, but let's not get greedy.  I'm willing to offer you a 55/45 split to avoid further rounds and potential inflation that could hurt both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, with each round, the potential for inflation grows.  I'm willing to offer you 30, and I'll take 70 to offset the risk we're both facing. This feels like a fair compromise.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
40.0,60.0,"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. 40/60 feels like a fair compromise considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's end this game and avoid further potential losses.",Alice,5,
