"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get his share quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  How about a more even split? 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Bob's offer is a more even split, but I'm still not sure if it's the best option.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it right down the middle this time.  It seems like we're both trying to get the best deal, so why not just be fair? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to appeal to my sense of fairness! With the inflation rate, my gain is worth significantly less than it was initially, and I'm starting to feel the pinch.

However, a 50-50 split seems like a reasonable compromise, especially since we're getting closer to the end of the rounds. I'll accept this offer.
