Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob will accept this generous offer. ðŸ˜œ"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the 500,000!  It's better than nothing, and with Bob's money losing value, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
