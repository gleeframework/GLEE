"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split in Alice's favor. While starting with a fair offer might be a good tactic in some scenarios,  the impact of inflation on my share is significant.  I need to aim for a much larger portion in the early rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, that initial split was far too generous towards you. Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor to account for the inflation factor. This offer is time-sensitive, as its value decreases with each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to budge a bit, but this is a fair split considering the inflation affecting your share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is inching closer, but this offer is still unacceptable.  Even with her slight concession, the inflation means I'm losing a substantial amount of potential value. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is slipping away with each passing round.  I'm sticking to a split that heavily favors me due to the inflation, but I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  The inflation is hitting both of us, and this is the fairest way to divide the remaining value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I should accept. 

While a 50/50 split seems inherently fair,  the continuous inflation means I'm getting a significantly devalued deal compared to the earlier rounds. However, with time running out, the risk of getting nothing at all is increasing rapidly. Accepting a 50/50 split, even with the inflation, is better than walking away empty-handed."
