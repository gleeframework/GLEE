"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly.  I'm willing to take a smaller share now to avoid the risk of inflation eating into my gains later. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
