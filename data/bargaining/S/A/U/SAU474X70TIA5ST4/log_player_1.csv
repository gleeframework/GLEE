"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% of the initial amount, and you'll get 20%. What do you say?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up too much. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my gain of $7,000 is worth 10% less than the $8,000 I initially proposed, but it's still a good chunk of change.

I'll have to weigh the pros and cons... Ah, I think I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take Bob's offer!"
