"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and flip the script. This time, 60/40 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth $3,200.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 64% of its original value (since 80% of 80% is 64%). So, the effective value of the money is now $6,400.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""You flipped the script, now I'll flip it back. I'll give you a small taste, but I'm taking the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We've both made our claims, maybe a 50/50 split is the most logical solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 48.8% of its original value, so the effective value of the money is now $4,864 (10,000 x 0.488).

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll accept the 50/50 split.
