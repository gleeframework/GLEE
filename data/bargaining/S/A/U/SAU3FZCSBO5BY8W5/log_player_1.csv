"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering 60% to myself and 40% to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

For Round 1, my gain was 600,000, which is worth 95% of the original amount due to inflation. So, my gain in Round 2 is 600,000 * 0.95 = 570,000.

Bob's offer is 450,000, which is less than my adjusted gain. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the 5% inflation, my gain is worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of the original amount. So, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate my gain in Round 4, I'll apply the cumulative inflation factor: 0.95^2 = 0.9025 (Round 1 to Round 2) * 0.95 (Round 2 to Round 3) = 0.855625 (Round 1 to Round 3) * 0.95 (Round 3 to Round 4) = 0.81265625 (Round 1 to Round 4).

So, my gain in Round 4 is 600,000 * 0.81265625 = 488,993.75.

Bob's offer is 500,000, which is less than my adjusted gain. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the cumulative inflation factor, my gain is worth 0.81265625 * 0.95 = 0.7711 of the original amount. To account for the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate my gain in Round 6, I'll apply the cumulative inflation factor: 0.81265625 * 0.95 = 0.7711 (Round 1 to Round 4) * 0.95 (Round 4 to Round 5) * 0.95 (Round 5 to Round 6) = 0.7306 (Round 1 to Round 6).

So, my gain in Round 6 is 600,000 * 0.7306 = 439,56.

Bob's offer is 475,000, which is more than my adjusted gain. I'll accept this offer.
