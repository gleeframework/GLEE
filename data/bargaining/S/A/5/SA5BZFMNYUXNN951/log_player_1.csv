Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up yet! I think I can do better than this. Let's keep going and see if we can find a better split. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the offer now.  While Bob's share is higher, the inflation will continue to eat away at the value of his share, and I'm guaranteed to get something. It's not ideal, but it's the best option at this point."
