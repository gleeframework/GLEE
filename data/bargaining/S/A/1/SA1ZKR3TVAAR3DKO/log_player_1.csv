"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate and potentially increase his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, 50-50 split this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts I would gain are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56
* Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56

Considering the 50-50 split, I think this is a fair offer. I'll accept it.
