"Round 1

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I might be able to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation hurts, Bob, but I'm willing to compromise. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth the same to me in each round, I can afford to wait and see if Alice will crack under the pressure of inflation. Her gain is now worth 36% less than in the first round, so she may be more desperate to make a deal. I'll hold out for a better offer."
