Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be a bit more equitable. How about a 55/45 split in your favor? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Bob offers next. He's losing money faster than I am."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a negotiation, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. 56/44 - it's a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

Bob is losing money faster, but it's getting close to the wire. A 56/44 split is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
