"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early to settle for a 40/60 split. Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the value of the money decreases with each round. Let's make a deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I'm aiming for a more balanced agreement. How about this? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers. A 45/55 split is reasonable given the inflation affecting Alice's share more."
