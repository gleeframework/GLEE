"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,750. Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,500.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather have a higher share of the money, even if it's worth less due to inflation. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the reduced value of money. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
