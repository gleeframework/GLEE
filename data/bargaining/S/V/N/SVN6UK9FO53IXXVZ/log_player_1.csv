"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond.""

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiations!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty one-sided offer, Bob. I'm not willing to accept such a low share.""
}
```

It's my turn to make the next offer."
