Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  It's a bit of a risky move, but I'm hoping he'll see it's in his best interest to accept, rather than risk getting nothing at all if we reach the 12th round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the $5,000 than risk getting nothing!"
