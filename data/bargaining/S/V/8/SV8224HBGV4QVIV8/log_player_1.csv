"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  This leaves a lot of money for me while still giving Bob something.  Since it's the first round, I am not too concerned about inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, this is a fair offer considering the inflation and the fact that it's only the second round.  Accepting this offer guarantees me at least half of the money, even with the inflation factored in."
