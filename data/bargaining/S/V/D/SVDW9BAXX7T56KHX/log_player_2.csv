Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I've reduced my share. Let's meet in the middle and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has reduced her share, it's crucial to remember the rapid devaluation of the money. A 5% loss per round for Bob adds up quickly.  Waiting her out is risky, but accepting a less-than-ideal offer now might be worse in the long run."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""The inflation is hurting both of us, Alice. This offer is fair considering the circumstances and the limited time we have left.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm increasing my share slightly from my previous offer while still acknowledging the pressure inflation puts on Alice. This might be a good point to push for a slightly better deal for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, and inflation is killing me. Let's split it closer to 50-50 and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tempting offer, as it's closer to 50-50 than ever before. However, time is working in my favor now.  Alice's losses are accelerating far faster than mine. Holding out for one more round could force her to make a much more desperate offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This is a generous offer considering the inflation working against you.  Take it before it's too late.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm pushing my advantage here.  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation much more than I am. By increasing my share, I'm applying pressure while still leaving a decent amount on the table for her. It's a gamble, but the potential reward of waiting her out is significant."
