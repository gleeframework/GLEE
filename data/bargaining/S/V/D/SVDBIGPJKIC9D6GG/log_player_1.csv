"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the money, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'll try to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the inflation."
