"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $600,000 and Bob will get $400,000. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to push back!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. The money is worth 0% less for me, so I'll stick to my original valuation. Bob's offer is still too skewed in his favor, considering the initial proposal I made. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to be more in line with Bob's offer in Round 2, but still slightly in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is pushing for a bigger share.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. The money is still worth the same for me, but Bob's gain is now worth significantly less due to inflation. I'm not willing to give up more than I did in my previous offer, so I'll stick to my guns.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not too much!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
