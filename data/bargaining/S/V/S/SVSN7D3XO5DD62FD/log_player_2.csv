"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up quickly. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** Delaying is detrimental to Bob due to the 5% inflation. It's crucial to secure a deal quickly.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By stating it's his final offer, Bob creates a sense of urgency and may lead Alice to accept rather than risk getting a worse offer later. 
* **Fairness with Urgency:** The offer is slightly tilted in Bob's favor but is still reasonable for Alice. This balances fairness with the need for a swift resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting impatient, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, Alice's offer is getting worse for Bob.  It's clear she's trying to exploit the fact that Bob's money is losing value.  He needs to hold firm and signal he's willing to risk further rounds to secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is it. A 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, Alice.  It's time to end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:**  Bob's offer signals he's reached his limit. The 50/50 split is objectively fair and presents a strong psychological anchor.
* **Increased Inflation Risk:** Waiting any longer significantly impacts Bob's potential gains. The difference between a slightly better offer and this one isn't worth the risk of further inflation.
* **Urgency and Clarity:**  The message is direct and leaves no room for interpretation. Alice understands this is Bob's final offer, increasing the pressure to accept."
