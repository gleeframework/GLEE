"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 seems fair considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While 40$ is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially considering Alice's money is depreciating at a slower rate.  I'll see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""It's my turn now. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is fair considering our different depreciation rates and gives us both a good amount. Let's end this quickly!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to come down a bit, but 60/40 in your favor is just not going to work. How about 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting 55/45 is a good compromise. It's better than risking further rounds and potentially losing more value due to inflation."
