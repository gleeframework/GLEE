"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he'll risk the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to flip the script, but I won't give in so easily.  Even with the inflation, a 10/90 split is far too unfair. I'll reject this offer and see if we can find a more equitable solution in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split, leaning more towards fairness.  Inflation is now a factor, but I still want to secure a reasonable amount for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
