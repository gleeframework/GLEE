"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $7,000 is worth less than my initial offer of $8,000. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation taking its toll, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Bob's offer is the same as mine in Round 3, but with the correct inflation adjustments applied. It seems like Bob is trying to make the same offer as before, but with the correct inflation adjustment for my gain.

I'll have to think carefully about this... but in the end, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take Bob's offer and end the game."
