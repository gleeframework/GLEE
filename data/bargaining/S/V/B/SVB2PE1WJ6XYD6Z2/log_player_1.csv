"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but it's still a fair amount for Bob.  I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept in the first round, before the inflation kicks in and makes things worse for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation rate is a significant factor here. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money, even though it's worth less due to inflation. Rejecting and proposing again would risk losing even more money due to further inflation."
