"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000 and keep $6000 for myself.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I'm willing to be generous. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the offer is still quite skewed towards Bob.

I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly smaller share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to take a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal.

However, I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that I'll be able to do better in future rounds.
