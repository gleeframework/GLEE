"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the smaller share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the bigger share, you can have the smaller one 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the adjusted values.

In this round, I would gain $100,000, which is worth 80% of the original $800,000 I proposed in Round 1 (since it's 20% less). That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, I'll propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 3:2 split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of the money, but I'll give you a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting worth less and less...

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than the original $800,000 I proposed in Round 1, I would gain $416,000 in today's value (80% of 520,000, which is 80% of 800,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $300,000, which is worth 37.5% of the original $800,000 (since it's 27.1% less than the original $400,000 I proposed in Round 1).

It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, 9:11 split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 9:11 split, where I get $450,000 and Bob gets $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount, but I need to take the majority 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting really worth less now...

Since the money is worth 67.23% less than the original $800,000 I proposed in Round 1, I would gain $264,000 in today's value (33% of 800,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $150,000, which is worth 18.75% of the original $800,000 (since it's 40.95% less than the original $250,000 I would have gotten in a 4:1 split).

It's a very small amount, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll think about it...
