Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we both compromise and split the money evenly.  Inflation is hurting us both, and this is the fairest way to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept Bob's offer this time. Considering the significant impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of the money by almost 41%, I believe an even split is a fair compromise. Further negotiations might not yield a better outcome, and it's better to secure a guaranteed amount rather than risking further devaluation. Let's end the game here and split the money evenly!"
