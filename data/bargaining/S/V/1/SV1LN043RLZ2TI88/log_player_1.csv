"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

I'm going to start with a relatively fair offer.  I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm leaving Bob with something. It's in my best interest to try and get the game finished quickly since the money is worth less to me each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very unfair.  Even though the money is worth less to me in each round, it's still not worth accepting such a small share.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my share a bit more, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him than his previous offer. I need to find a balance between getting a fair share and avoiding too many rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfair, and even though the money is worth less to me now, it's still not worth accepting such a small share. I'll reject this offer and keep trying to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but I'm trying to keep it within a reasonable range. With each passing round, the value of the money I receive decreases, so I need to find a balance between getting a good share and finishing the game before the money becomes worthless.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a more fair offer than his previous ones."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair. I'm losing a lot of value with each round, but I'm not going to accept such a small share. I'll keep trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm still trying to get a fair share, but I need to start making bigger concessions to get Bob to accept an offer.  I'm hoping this offer is enticing enough for him, as I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unacceptable.  I'm losing a lot of value with each round, but I'm not going to accept such a small share.  I'll keep trying to negotiate a better deal, but I need to start getting more aggressive with my offers.  It's time to start taking risks."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

The money is losing value quickly.  This is getting dangerous.  I'm going to make a risky offer, hoping to get Bob to accept it and get the game finished before the money becomes worthless.  I'm reducing my share even further, but I'm trying to offer a deal that's still enticing to Bob."
