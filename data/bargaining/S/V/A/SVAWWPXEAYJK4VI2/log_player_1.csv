"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, this way we both get a decent amount""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly.  Let's try this! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 5% decrease in value for Bob's gain, but I'm willing to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer of $45 for me and $55 for him. It's not perfect, but it's a more even split than my initial proposal, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game moving."
