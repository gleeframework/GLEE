"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take it all, you can't beat this offer!""
}
```

This is a strong opening move, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 99, and you can have 1. It's better than nothing, right? 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think so!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to settle for just $1, especially when I know the money will be worth even less in future rounds. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it fairly""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and giving Bob a reasonable share."
