"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more, considering the money loses value for both of us over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
 

Let's see how Alice reacts to a rejection and what she proposes in the next round. While her offer isn't terrible considering the inflation, Bob can potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's find a fairer split.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value depreciates quickly, Bob. I'm offering a bit more than you wanted last round, let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation, but Bob still has some leverage.  He's losing money due to inflation, but holding out for a slightly better deal might be worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Time is running out.""
}
```"
