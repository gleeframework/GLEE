I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving 900,000 and Bob receiving 100,000.  This is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 

I propose a 60/40 split, with me receiving 600,000 and Bob receiving 400,000. This is a more balanced offer compared to Bob's last proposal, and while I am taking a loss due to inflation, I believe a larger share is more fair."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
