"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the fact that the money loses value faster for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer seems fair, it's in my best interest to see if I can get a better deal. The inflation rate is higher for me, so I need to be careful and try to maximize my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split the money with me getting a slightly larger share, reflecting the higher inflation rate I'm facing.  This way, we both get more than we would if we simply keep rejecting each other's offers.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both lose if this drags on.  I'm making a final offer that's closer to my original split, but still acknowledges your inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation rate is significantly hurting me.  Alice's offer is close to my initial rejection and it's better than potentially getting nothing if we continue to reject each other's offers."
