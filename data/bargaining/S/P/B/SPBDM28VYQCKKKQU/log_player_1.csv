Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the fact that the money loses value faster for you.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money with me getting a slightly larger share, reflecting the higher inflation rate I'm facing.  This way, we both get more than we would if we simply keep rejecting each other's offers. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
