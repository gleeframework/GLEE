"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting with a generous offer, but we both know the money is worth less with each round. Let's work together to find a fair solution. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, it's a huge disparity.  Bob can likely do better by waiting and making his own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I'm offering a more even split, and we both know the value of the money is declining with each round.  Let's end this before things get worse for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a solution before the value of the money drops too much further. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still offering a very uneven split. Even though the value of the money is decreasing, it's still worth waiting another round and trying for a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you a majority, but we need to find a compromise before the money becomes worthless.  It's getting too risky for both of us.""}
