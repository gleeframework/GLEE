"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money with a slight advantage for me to start. This ensures we both benefit from dividing the money sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's proposal sounds reasonable at first glance, it significantly favors her. Accepting a 40/60 split in the very first round means I'm losing out on potential gains from negotiating a fairer deal.  Since we have 12 rounds, there's ample time to strive for a more balanced outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I appreciate your proposal, Alice, but let's aim for something more balanced. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a reasonable starting point."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** A 55/45 split is closer to an even division, making it more likely for Alice to consider seriously.
* **Time Value:**  While I want a better deal than 40/60, I recognize that waiting too long reduces the value of the money. This offer presents a compromise between maximizing my gain and acknowledging the time constraint. 
* **Negotiation Tactic:** By offering a slightly higher amount than a straight 50/50 split, I'm signaling my desire for a larger share while leaving room for potential counter-offers from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but time is running out and the money is losing value. This offer is a compromise, giving you a decent amount while still reflecting the advantage of proposing first. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the dwindling time and inflation to pressure me into accepting a bad deal.  While 4200 is more than my initial offer of 4000, it's a significantly smaller percentage of the total remaining value. I need to hold firm and demonstrate I'm willing to wait for a fairer offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. I'm proposing a 52/48 split. This gives me a slight advantage, but it's far more balanced than our previous offers. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** With each round, the diminishing value of the money necessitates a faster resolution. My message emphasizes the need to agree quickly.
* **Concession:** I'm lowering my demand slightly from 55/45 to 52/48, signaling a willingness to negotiate and meet closer to the middle ground. 
* **Framing:** By highlighting the fairness of my offer compared to previous ones, I'm subtly steering Alice towards a deal that benefits us both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a middle ground between our previous proposals.  Let's be reasonable and end this before inflation significantly diminishes our returns. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're now past the halfway point, and the money is losing value rapidly. The risk of walking away with nothing is increasing significantly.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, 4500 is the same amount Alice originally offered in Round 2. However, due to inflation, that amount is now worth significantly less. Continuing to hold out for a slightly better split might not be worth the risk of losing everything. 
* **Compromise:** Alice's offer is positioned as a middle ground, and it's closer to a fair split than her previous proposals. Accepting shows a willingness to compromise and avoid a complete loss."
