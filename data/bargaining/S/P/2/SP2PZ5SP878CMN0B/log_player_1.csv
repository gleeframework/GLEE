"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm too greedy, huh?

I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split, especially after the first round. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, and another 20% less after the second round, the total value of the money is now 40% of the original amount. I'll take this into account when making my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! Let's find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a more even split than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still not satisfied with my previous offers.

Considering the continued inflation, the total value of the money is now 51.2% of the original amount. I'll take this into account when evaluating Bob's new offer.

However, I'm not willing to accept a 65-35 split, as I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. Let's meet at 40-60!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
