Round 2

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather get a bigger share of the money that's worth less due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer.
