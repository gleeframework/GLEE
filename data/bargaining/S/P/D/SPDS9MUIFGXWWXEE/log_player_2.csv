"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40.  We can adjust things in the future if we need to. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's fair on the surface, the inflation rates are a huge factor. I'm only losing 10% per round, while Alice loses 20%.  I want to see if I can get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
