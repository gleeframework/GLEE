"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I'm the one making the offer""}

I'm proposing that I get 8000 and Bob gets 2000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but with a slight bias towards myself since I'm the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we are both taking turns proposing. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially since I'm the one who made the first offer and Bob is now trying to take advantage of the fact that I had to make the first move. I'd rather wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more since I've been patient so far""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split than before, but still trying to get a better deal than the 60/40 split Bob suggested earlier."
