"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a big chunk, but you get something too.  Think about it,  the longer we wait, the less the money is worth!  
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting,  it's best to see if I can get a better deal.  Since the money is losing value, I'm better off waiting to make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation. Let's end this before the money loses more value.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I still need a larger share.  Let's end this quickly before the value keeps dropping! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure some money before it's worth even less."
