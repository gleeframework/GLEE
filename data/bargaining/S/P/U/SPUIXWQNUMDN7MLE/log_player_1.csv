Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. Since Bob's money is worth less with each round, I want to incentivize him to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Bob is still being quite greedy, but I know his money will depreciate even further with each round. I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer a more even split.  Bob's money is worth a lot less than mine now, so hopefully this will be more attractive to him.  I'm willing to give up a little bit of my potential gain to get to a deal quickly."
