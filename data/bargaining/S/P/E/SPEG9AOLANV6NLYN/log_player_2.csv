Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fair split, Bob. However, I need to account for the inflation we're experiencing. 600,000 for me and 400,000 for you seems like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the changing value of money. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
