"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. I get $6,000, you get $4,000.  A fair deal to kick things off. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle? This deal accounts for the slight inflation disadvantage you're facing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. This is a bit closer to my initial offer, but factors in the inflation we both face.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4060 
# Alice gain: 5940 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but it's still heavily in her favor.  Given the faster rate of inflation against her, she'll be more willing to make a better offer in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice, and the value is shrinking!  This offer is a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation. Let's close this out.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** By round 4, it's important to emphasize the shrinking pot due to inflation. This encourages Alice to settle sooner.
* **Slight Advantage:** Offering Alice slightly more than Bob keeps the offer appealing to her, given the faster devaluation she faces.
* **Appearance of Compromise:** While still favoring Bob in the long run, framing the offer as a ""good deal for both"" makes it more palatable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting serious!  We need to agree soon. I'm taking a bit of a hit here, considering the inflation, but this is a fair compromise. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 4234 
# Alice gain: 5766 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, using phrases like ""this is getting serious!"" and ""take it or leave it!"" However, her offer is still significantly skewed in her favor, especially considering she's losing value faster.  We're past the halfway point, and she needs this deal more than Bob does now. Holding out for a better offer in the next round or two is the stronger move."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real - the clock is ticking, and every second costs us both. This offer is the fairest solution. Take it, and we both walk away with a decent share. Don't let greed make us both losers.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Even Split:**  Offering a 50/50 split might seem counterintuitive, but it's a strong psychological play at this stage. It portrays fairness and a willingness to compromise, which Alice might find appealing after her previous offers were rejected. 
* **Emphasizing Shared Loss:** The message focuses on the risk of losing everything if they don't agree soon. This urgency might push Alice to accept, especially since she's experiencing a faster devaluation of the money.
* **Call to Action:** The phrase ""Don't let greed make us both losers"" adds a touch of emotional pressure and frames a rejection as a greedy move on Alice's part."
