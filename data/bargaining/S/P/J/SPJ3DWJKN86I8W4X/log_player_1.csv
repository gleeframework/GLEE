"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so I'll consider the offer accordingly.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I feel that I'm not getting a fair share, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:
