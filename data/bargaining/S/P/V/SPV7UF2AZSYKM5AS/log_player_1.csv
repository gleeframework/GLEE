Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself.  I figure Bob might be tempted to take it, but I'm prepared for him to counter.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to get more, this is a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing if we keep going.  Plus, there's the inflation to consider.  Let's call it a day!"
