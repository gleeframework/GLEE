"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a fairer split considering we'll both be losing money over time.  Let's reach an agreement before the value of our money drops further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
