Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is to give me 70% and take 30%, I'm not too thrilled about it. I was hoping for a more balanced split.

But, considering the inflation and the fact that my gains are still worth the same as in the first round, I'll decide to...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end the game."

# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Bob's offer is to give me 75% and take 25%, which is a significant improvement from his previous offers. However, I'm still not thrilled about giving him such a small share.
