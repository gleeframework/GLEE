"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good starting point, I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the money""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. My message is a bit aggressive, hoping to set a strong tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not going to be generous 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit stingy, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'd rather accept this offer than risk waiting for a better one. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
