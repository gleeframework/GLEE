Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in the first round was rejected, and now Bob is offering a 50/50 split. That's a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it yet. I'll reject it for now and try to get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (80% of the original value), I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! Since the money is worth less and less, I need to adjust my strategy. Bob's offer is a 40/60 split, which is a good deal considering the decreasing value of money. I'll accept it.
