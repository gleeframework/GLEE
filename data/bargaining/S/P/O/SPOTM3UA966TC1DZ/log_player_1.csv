Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 55/45 split. We can still avoid significant losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
