"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 95/5 split in my favor. I figure Bob will be happy with anything, and this gives me the best starting point for this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, it's clear that Bob is not going to be very cooperative. With the inflation hitting him harder than me, this is the best I'm likely to get."
