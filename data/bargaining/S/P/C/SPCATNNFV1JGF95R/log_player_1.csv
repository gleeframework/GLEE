"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we can both walk away happy.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  Alice starts with a strong offer that heavily favors her (90/10 split). This establishes a position of power early on. 
* **Time Pressure:** The threat of inflation is real for Bob. Every round he waits, the money is worth less to him.  This creates pressure for him to accept a less-than-ideal offer.
* **Message Tone:** The message is firm but also attempts to frame the offer as beneficial to Bob, potentially making him more open to accepting it. 
 
This strategy aims for a quick resolution in Alice's favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While an even split seems fair on the surface, Bob's offer significantly undervalues Alice's position. 

* **Inflation Advantage:** Alice is not affected by inflation, while Bob's potential gains decrease each round. Time is on Alice's side.
* **First Offer Leverage:** Bob rejecting the first offer suggests he might be willing to negotiate for a slightly smaller share than an even split.

Alice should aim higher, leveraging the inflation factor and the momentum of the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 850000,
""bob_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money in this game. I'm being generous, but this offer won't last forever.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice reduces her demand slightly from the initial 90/10 split, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a heavily favorable outcome.
* **Emphasize Inflation:** The message directly reminds Bob that each round costs him money due to inflation, creating urgency.
* **Limited-Time Offer:**  By stating the offer ""won't last forever,"" Alice introduces a sense of scarcity and encourages a quicker decision. 

This approach balances firmness with a slight concession to keep the negotiation moving in Alice's favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 60/40 in your favor. It's a fair deal considering the inflation and time is ticking away. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now approaching a level where it makes sense for Alice to accept. Here's why:

* **Significant Gain:** Alice still receives a substantial majority of the money (60%), which was her goal from the beginning.
* **Inflation Impact:** While Bob's offer has improved, it's important to remember that the actual value he's getting is 27.1% less than what it initially appears. This means his real gain is closer to $291,600 in ""Round 1 dollars.""
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer carries increasing risk. There's no guarantee Bob will offer more favorable terms, and the remaining rounds are limited. Accepting now locks in a very strong gain for Alice.

While Alice might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the potential gains are outweighed by the increasing risk of getting nothing if they fail to reach an agreement. This is a good deal for Alice."
