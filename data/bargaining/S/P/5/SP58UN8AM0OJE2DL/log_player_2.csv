Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate. The longer this goes on, the more the inflation hurts her, and the better my bargaining position gets. I can afford to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm offering a 50/50 split. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and time pressure is mounting on Alice.  
* **Shifting Power:** The inflation heavily favors me. Offering 50/50 now seems ""fair"" due to the circumstances, even though it benefits me more. 
* **Avoiding a Lost Opportunity:**  I don't want to push Alice too far and risk getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
