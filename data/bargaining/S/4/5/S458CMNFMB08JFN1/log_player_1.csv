"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, giving me the majority of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's 50/50 split."
