I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me taking $900,000 and Bob taking $100,000.  I figure this is a good starting point, and hopefully, Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy, but I'm going to lower my share a bit to $800,000 and offer Bob $200,000. I hope this is more appealing to him, especially given that the value of the money is decreasing with each round."
