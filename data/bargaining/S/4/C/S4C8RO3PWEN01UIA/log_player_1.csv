"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

This offer suggests that we both receive $500,000 each, a straightforward and equal split. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A little more for me, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'm not too thrilled about giving him $700,000, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You got 70% of the pie, now it's my turn to get a bigger slice""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a smaller share than his previous offer, but I'm trying to get a larger share for myself. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us.

While I was hoping to get a larger share, $450,000 is a decent offer, and it's getting closer to a fair split. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's shake on it, Bob!"
