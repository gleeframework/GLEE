Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting slightly better, time is running out and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for Bob. Alice is likely to continue pushing her advantage, so holding out a bit longer might force her to make a better offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Time is running out! I'm making a concession, but this needs to end now.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting anxious, I'll take advantage of that 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The relentless march of inflation is killing Bob. While 44 dollars is a bad deal, waiting any longer risks getting even worse offers from Alice who clearly senses Bob's desperation.  It's time to cut losses and take what can be salvaged."
