I'm starting with a proposal that gives me most of the money, but leaves Bob with a small amount. It's risky, but I want to see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, I'm losing 20% of the value of my gains with each round. Accepting now is the best way to ensure I get something, even if it's a small amount."
