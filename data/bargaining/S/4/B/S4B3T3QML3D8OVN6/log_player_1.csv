"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $55 and Bob will get $45. This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation rates. If Bob accepts, I'll get $55, and if he doesn't, the money will be worth less for both of us in the next round. Since Bob's inflation rate is higher, he has more to lose if he waits. This offer gives me a slight advantage while still being somewhat fair. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take a little more this time, but we can be flexible in the future. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. Although the money is worth less for both of us due to inflation, Bob's proposed split doesn't take into account the fact that his inflation rate is much higher than mine. Accepting this offer would mean I'm not considering the future value of the money. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round, trying to find a better balance considering the inflation rates."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more this time""}\n\nIn this round, I'll increase my share to $58 and offer Bob $42. Given that the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the first round, and taking into account that we've already lost value in the previous rounds, I believe this offer still gives Bob a reasonable amount while also reflecting the impact of inflation on our potential gains. The message aims to explain the reasoning behind my offer, emphasizing the effect of inflation. Let's see if Bob accepts this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is biting, and a fair share is important. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's offer seems fair at first glance, splitting the money evenly, it doesn't account for the significantly different inflation rates we're experiencing. Given that the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than initially, and the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less, accepting an even split would disproportionately benefit Bob. Considering the future value of the money, I believe I can propose a better division that acknowledges these differences in inflation impact. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Inflation is indeed biting, but we have different bites""}\n\nIn this round, I'll propose taking $62 and offering Bob $38. Given the increasing impact of inflation and the substantial difference in how it affects us, I believe this division better reflects the current value of the money to each of us. My message acknowledges Bob's point about inflation but also highlights the disparity in our inflation rates, explaining why I'm proposing a split that gives me more. I'm trying to find a balance that considers the real value of the money we'll receive, taking into account the significant decrease in value Bob's share has undergone. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it like in round 1, but with the adjusted values due to inflation. It's the most fair option for both of us right now. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Bob, and the fact that we're already halfway through the rounds, accepting this offer seems reasonable. The split is the same as my initial proposal, but due to inflation, the actual value is much less. Given the decreasing value of the money, especially for Bob, and the risk of ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision at this point. It provides a certain outcome rather than risking further devaluation or the possibility of getting nothing.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
