Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $45 and took $55 for myself, with a message suggesting that we should divide the money fairly, but with me taking a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, your turn to get a bit less this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I offered Bob $45 and took $55 for myself in the first round, and now Bob is offering me $45, I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make a new offer to Bob. Here it is:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose the middle ground.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to take that into account when considering Bob's offer. Given that Bob is offering me $48, and the money is worth less to me now, I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.
