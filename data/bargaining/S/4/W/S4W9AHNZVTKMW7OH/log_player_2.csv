"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000.  It's important to reach a deal quickly while the money is still worth the most! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, I think your offer was a bit unfair. Let's be more equitable. I'm willing to give you $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. This way we both get a fair share, and we avoid the risk of further inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, literally! Your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. I'm proposing $5500 for me and $4500 for you.  This accounts for the decreasing value and avoids further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
