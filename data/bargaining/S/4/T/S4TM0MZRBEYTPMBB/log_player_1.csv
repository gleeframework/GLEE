"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money to start with, and we can negotiate further if we want to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal, considering the inflation. My 450,000 would be worth 36,000 less than my original 600,000, while Bob's 550,000 would be worth 5,000 less than his original 575,000. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation. Let's meet somewhere in between.""
}
```

I'm trying to account for the inflation by offering a slightly higher amount to myself, while still being willing to compromise and give Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. What do you say to this split? 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get closer to his original offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a higher share than I offered in round 3, considering the inflation. My gain of 480,000 would be worth 36% less than my original 600,000, while Bob's gain of 520,000 would be worth 9.1% less than his original 575,000. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 50/50, but I think this is the fairest deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that accounts for the inflation and gives us both a fair share."
