Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making some concessions, the deal still heavily favors her. It's important to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a fair share, especially with the increasing pressure from inflation."
