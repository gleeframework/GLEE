"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost equally, accounting for some inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll propose my own split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. I'm willing to give you a good portion, but I also want to ensure I get a fair share.  Let's see if we can find a good compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a slightly larger share, time is running out and the value is decreasing.  A 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
