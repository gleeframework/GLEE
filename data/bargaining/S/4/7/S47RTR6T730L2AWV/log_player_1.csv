"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but it's still fair to Bob since he gets a significant amount as well.  I'm hoping he'll accept it, as it's a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than what I initially proposed, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my proposed share a little bit, but still keep it below what Bob offered.  I believe this is a fair offer that acknowledges the inflation impacting Bob, but still gives me a good portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting better for him each round, so I need to accept before his offer becomes too good to pass up.  While it's less than what I wanted initially, it's still a good outcome."
