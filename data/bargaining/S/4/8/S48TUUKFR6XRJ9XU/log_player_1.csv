"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$, which is 40$. I'll take the remaining 60$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $60 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $57.

Bob's offer of $50 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $40.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I'm getting a slightly better deal due to the inflation.
