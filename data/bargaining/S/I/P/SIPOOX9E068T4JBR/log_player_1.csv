"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

My current gain of $9,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $8,550.
Bob's offer of $5,000 is worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,000.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Since my gain of $8,550 in the previous round is worth 95% of its original value, I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the new total to compensate for the inflation.

I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a decent share to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

My current gain of $8,550 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $7,234.10.
Bob's offer of $4,000 is worth 40% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,000.
Bob's offer of $6,000 is worth 60% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $6,000.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
