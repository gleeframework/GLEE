"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can have 60, it's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. In this case, I would actually be getting $32 (40 x 0.8) if I accept this offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% less than the previous round), I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
