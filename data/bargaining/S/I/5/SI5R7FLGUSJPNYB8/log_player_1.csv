Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement. Since the money loses value faster for him, he might be inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is a significant decrease from my initial proposal, it's still a good outcome for me.  The value of the money is depreciating for both of us, and I'm not sure I'd be able to get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation penalty for Bob.  It's better to secure a decent share now rather than risk getting nothing later."
