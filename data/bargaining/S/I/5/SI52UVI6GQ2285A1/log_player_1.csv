"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can both get something!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the game!

Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $200,000, which is worth 90% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $180,000 in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but still willing to give Bob a decent share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 72.9% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $727,000 in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the decreasing value of the money...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive this time, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
