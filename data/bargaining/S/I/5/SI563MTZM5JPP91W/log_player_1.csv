"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, but I'm not going to accept Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 40-60 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for a slightly larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is taking a toll on the money's value. I'll have to be careful with my next move. Bob's offer is similar to his previous one, but I'll think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is getting scarcer and scarcer. I'll aim for an even larger share to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is the same offer I made in round 1, but I'm hoping that Bob will be more willing to accept it now that the stakes are higher."
