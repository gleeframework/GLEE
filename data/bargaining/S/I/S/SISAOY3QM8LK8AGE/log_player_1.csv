"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $2,000 and keep $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 20% less, so I get $3,200 (4000 * 0.8) and Bob gets $4,800 (6000 * 0.8).

I accept the offer.
