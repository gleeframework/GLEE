"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that I get 6000$ and Bob gets 4000$. This seems like a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation to affect Bob more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I prefer to get more, it's better to take a slightly worse offer than risk getting nothing at all due to inflation."
