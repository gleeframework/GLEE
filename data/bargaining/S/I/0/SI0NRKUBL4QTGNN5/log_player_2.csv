"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's best to see what Alice will offer in the next round.  We have 12 rounds to get the most money, and the inflation factor makes waiting potentially very advantageous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need a good chunk to make this worth my while.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I need to prioritize my own gain 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the first round, it's still not great considering the inflation. I can likely get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Time is running out. Let's be reasonable and agree on a split that benefits both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a decent share 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is the best offer I've seen yet, and while the inflation is taking a toll, it's unlikely to get much better. Accepting this secures a decent amount of money."
