"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, taking 90% of the money.  I figure Bob might be hesitant to risk losing even more in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled with this offer, the inflation is starting to bite. Taking 4500 now is better than risking getting less in the next round."
