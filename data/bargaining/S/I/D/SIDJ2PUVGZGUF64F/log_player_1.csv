"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 30, and I'll take 70. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split, no need to overthink it! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, my actual gain would be 50 * 0.95 = 47.5.

Considering this, I'd rather not accept Bob's 50-50 offer, as it would put me at a disadvantage due to the inflation. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather not meet in the middle, I'll make a new offer. How about 55 for me and 45 for you?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, my actual gain would be 55 * 0.95 = 52.25.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 48, and I'll take 52. It's a slight adjustment from my previous offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much. You can try to do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, my actual gain would be 60 * 0.8586 = 51.516, which is approximately 51.52.

Considering this, I'd rather not accept Bob's 60-40 offer, as it would put me at a disadvantage due to the inflation. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather not take 40, I'll make a new offer. How about 58 for me and 42 for you?""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 49,
  ""bob_gain"": 51,
