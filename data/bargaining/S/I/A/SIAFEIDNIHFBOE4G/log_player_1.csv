"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60% of the initial amount, leaving you with 40%. Let's seal the deal!""
}
```

This offer is a fairly standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'm not willing to give up that much. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too one-sided. I'd like a better deal!""
