"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 and keep the rest. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split in my favor, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not being too generous yet. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $900,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $855,000. The offer from Bob is a 70-30 split, which is not as favorable to me as I would have liked.

However, it's still a decent offer, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better one later. I'll accept the offer.
