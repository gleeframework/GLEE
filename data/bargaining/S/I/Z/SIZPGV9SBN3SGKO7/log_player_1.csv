"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more for my skills! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'm willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a 2:1 advantage. That's a pretty significant disparity, and I think I deserve a fairer share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, but still giving Bob a significant share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I've earned it after your last offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'm willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a 7:3 advantage. That's an even more significant disparity than before, and I think I deserve a fairer share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, let's split it 55/45""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50/50 split, but still gives me a slight edge. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
