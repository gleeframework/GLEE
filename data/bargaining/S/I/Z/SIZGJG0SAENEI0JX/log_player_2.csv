"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to try and get a better deal.  60-40 is a bit too lopsided in Alice's favor, especially since I'm losing value on my share faster."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation we both face. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but 57-43 is as low as I can go for now. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  57-43 is a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
