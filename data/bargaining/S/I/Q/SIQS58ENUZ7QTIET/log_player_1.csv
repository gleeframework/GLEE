Congratulations, the game is over.\n\nThe final division is:\n\n* Alice (you): $590,000\n* Bob: $410,000\n\nHowever, remember that the money is worth less due to inflation. Since there were 3 rounds, the money is worth 15% less for you (5% per round) and 30% less for Bob (10% per round).\n\nThe actual value of the money is:\n\n* Alice (you): $590,000 x 0.85 = $501,500\n* Bob: $410,000 x 0.70 = $287,000\n\nCongratulations on playing the game!
