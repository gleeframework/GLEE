**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob needs to make a decision before the deal gets even worse for him. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob. Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller share, even if he gets a slightly better split in a future round.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly employing a strategy of slow increases.  She's likely betting on Bob caving as the value decreases. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting the current offer guarantees Bob a reasonable sum. Rejecting it carries significant risk of getting even less in future rounds.

It's a tough choice, but at this point, cutting losses and taking the guaranteed amount is the most logical move for Bob."
