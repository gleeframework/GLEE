I propose to keep $9,000 and give $1,000 to Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob $1,900 and keeping $8,100 for myself.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but I'm still accounting for the inflation affecting my share."
