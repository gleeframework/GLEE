"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair, 90/10 split.  Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives me only 10% of the money, and with 11 remaining rounds, I'm confident I can negotiate a more favorable split. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 60/40 is a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe a larger share is fair given the inflation disadvantage. Let's try 80/20. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice has increased her offer, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. The 80/20 split is not favorable enough, and with 9 remaining rounds, I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to potentially secure a more substantial share. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to adjust my proposal. A 55/45 split is a more reasonable compromise.""}"
