# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after one round, I'll offer a higher share to make up for the loss. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share is worth even less. I'll think carefully about this offer... Since Alice is now offering a 50-50 split, I'll accept it.
