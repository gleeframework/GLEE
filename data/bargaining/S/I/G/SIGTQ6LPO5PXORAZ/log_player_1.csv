"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $10,000, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, as I'm taking the risk of rejection. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $6,000 from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $5,400. However, in this round, I'd be getting $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000.

I think Bob's offer is a bit cheeky, considering he's not offering me a better deal than his previous rejection. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 81% of its original value (90% * 90% = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81), so I'll take that into account when making my offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the original $10,000, which is $4,500, and I'll take the remaining $5,500."
