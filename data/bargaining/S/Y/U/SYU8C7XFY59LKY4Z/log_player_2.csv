"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was kind but didn't quite work for me. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor this round.  Let's wrap this up and each get something!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. Since we both rejected the previous offers, I think a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get something.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
 
While I'd prefer my 60/40 split, waiting any longer diminishes the returns significantly. A 50/50 split is still a gain, and better than risking a worse offer in future rounds."
