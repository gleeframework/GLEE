"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""My turn! This offer is better for both of us in the long run. Think about it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer was essential.** Her offer heavily favored her, and the inflation mechanism means waiting out the game slightly benefits me more than her.
* **This offer is a strong starting point.** It's slightly in my favor, reflecting the fact that further rounds benefit me more due to the inflation difference.
* **The message aims to encourage Alice to think strategically.** It hints at the impact of inflation without explicitly revealing my advantage. This could lead her to accept a less favorable deal now rather than risk getting even less later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less than before, but still more than you offered 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier!  While her offer is slightly better than her first one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the inflation.  It seems she hasn't fully grasped the impact of the decreasing value, and I'm willing to bet she'll be more desperate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice.  The clock is ticking, and this offer is the fairest you'll get.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time to switch tactics.** Alice seems fixed on getting more than me. Offering a 50/50 split seems like the best way to end this quickly before inflation eats away at the pot.
* **Message is firm but fair.** I'm highlighting the time pressure (inflation) and presenting this offer as the most logical and equitable solution. 
* **This minimizes risk.** Accepting a worse offer in a later round is a real possibility if Alice continues to overestimate her negotiating position."
