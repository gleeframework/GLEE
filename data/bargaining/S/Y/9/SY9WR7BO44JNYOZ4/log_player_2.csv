"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:2 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems reasonable at first glance, it's important to consider the potential impact of inflation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make the next proposal and potentially secure a more favorable outcome.  Since the money depreciates with each round, waiting to propose might be a better strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the potential impact of inflation and gives you a fair share. Let's end this quickly.""
