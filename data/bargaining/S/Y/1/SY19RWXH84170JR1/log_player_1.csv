"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain remains the same, I'm getting a better deal than Bob, but he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust the ratio to my advantage. Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```
I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob's offer has changed again. Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is now worth significantly less than in the previous round.

I'll think carefully about this offer... and decide to accept it.
