"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but we can negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept getting only 10% of the money.  Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair. We both get a good amount, and it's a better deal than the last offer. Let's be reasonable here.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 70/30. We both get a decent amount, and it's more than the previous round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm aware of the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers. 70/30 is a decent amount, and at least I'm getting something."
