# Alice gain: 65

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is fair, and the money is becoming worthless. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, the relentless inflation means Bob's position is rapidly weakening. Accepting a 40/60 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing as time runs out."
