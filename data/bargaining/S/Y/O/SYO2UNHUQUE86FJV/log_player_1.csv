"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, I think that's the fairest way to do it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the even split, but I think it's a decent compromise. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'm not getting as much as I would have in the first round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
