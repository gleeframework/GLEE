"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000. I've attached a message saying ""Let's divide fairly"" to try to persuade him to accept my proposal.\n\nYour turn! Please let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If he rejects, I'll have to make a new proposal in the next round, taking into account the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share this round, you can have the bigger share next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I would only effectively receive $320,000, while Bob's share would only be reduced by 5%. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, despite the decreasing value of the money. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $450,000 and I'll take $550,000. I've attached a message saying ""Let's meet in the middle"" to try to persuade him to accept my proposal. Since the money is worth even less in this round, I'm trying to find a compromise that Bob will accept before the money loses even more value.\n\nYour turn! Please let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If he rejects, I'll have to make a new proposal in the next round, taking into account the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but I promise to be more generous next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer. Although the money is worth significantly less for me in this round, I would still effectively receive $230,400. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'm not confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll take the offer and end the game here.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
