Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, but I think a 90/10 split is a little too generous.  Let's try a 90/10 split in my favor. After all, I am the one taking all the risk with this inflation! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
