"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split considering the potential for inflation.  Let's make this quick and end the game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's proposal, I think I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation factor. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give myself a slightly larger share, while still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
