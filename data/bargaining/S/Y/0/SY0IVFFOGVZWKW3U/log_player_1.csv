"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's aim for a fair outcome. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I need to reassess the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too keen on giving him a 65% share, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with 65% going to Bob. Let's aim for a more balanced split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, my target share is slightly lower now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```"
