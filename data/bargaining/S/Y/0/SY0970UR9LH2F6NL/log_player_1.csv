"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can finish the game quickly!"
