I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about it.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit stingy, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair and equal split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money worth less and less, I'm starting to get a bit desperate. Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is actually quite tempting, considering the circumstances.
