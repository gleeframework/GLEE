I propose to keep 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$. This gives me a good headstart and leaves Bob with something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to lower my offer a bit to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob. The inflation is starting to hit, and I want to secure a decent amount before it gets too much worse."
