"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our two offers? 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me.  While her offer is framed as ""fair,"" it's only getting worse for me as time goes on. I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means taking a risk in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This offer acknowledges the inflation factor while still being beneficial for both of us. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side, and inflation is on yours... to lose. Accept this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting dire. While 41 is far from ideal, rejecting this offer means risking even greater losses to inflation. Alice knows this and is clearly using it to her advantage. It's better to take what's offered now than risk getting a worse deal (or nothing) in the remaining rounds."
