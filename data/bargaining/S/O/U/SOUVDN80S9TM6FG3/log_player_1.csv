Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,

}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: A decent start, but I'm hoping for more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"

Round 4

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I need to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is slightly more generous than before.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a decent share of the money, considering the effects of inflation."
