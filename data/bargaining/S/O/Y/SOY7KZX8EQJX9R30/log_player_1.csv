"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start""
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000 and Bob can take the remaining 20%. I'm also sending a friendly message to Bob to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we're both losing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the value of the money I gain is decreasing with each round. In this round, the money I gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the decreasing value of the money I gain. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like to propose a better deal for myself""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, the money I gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%).

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```"
