Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both have a chance to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a better split than his previous offer, it's still not good enough for me. I want a bigger share of the money, and I know I can get it if I keep playing."
