"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept and end the game."
