"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation rate is higher for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 55/45. We both need to be realistic about the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly better than the first one, I still think I can negotiate for a larger share considering the impact of inflation is more significant on Alice's gain. I'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 625000, ""alice_gain"": 375000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your share, I think 62.5-37.5 is a fairer split at this point.""}"
