"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I think this is a reasonable split, considering I'm the one making the first offer."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll think for a moment...

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

However, Bob's offer is a substantial increase from his previous one, and I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round. I'll think for a moment...
