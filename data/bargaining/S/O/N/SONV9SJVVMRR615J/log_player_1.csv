"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a generous offer, giving Bob 10% and keeping 90% for myself.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm hoping he'll accept and we can both walk away with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less fair than my first offer, even accounting for inflation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to reduce my share a bit further to 80%, but I think it's still a fair offer given the inflation and Bob's previous rejection. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also trying to secure a good portion of the money before it depreciates too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfavorable to me.  The inflation has eaten away at the value of the money, but I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll continue to make my own proposals and see if I can get a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my share further to 70%, hoping that Bob will recognize the diminishing value of the money and be more willing to negotiate.  We're both losing money with each passing round, and I'm trying to find a middle ground that will at least give us both some meaningful compensation."
