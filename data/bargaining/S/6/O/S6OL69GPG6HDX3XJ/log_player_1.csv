Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing value with each passing round. Let's meet in the middle. This offer gives you a larger share, but it's still better than getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is finally moving significantly closer to a more agreeable split.  The rate of inflation is hurting him more than me, so waiting for a potentially better deal in later rounds is too risky. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing at all."
