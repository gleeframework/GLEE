"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Analyze the proposal
Alice proposes a 60/40 split, with her taking the larger share. This means I, Bob, would get $40, and Alice would get $60.

## Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation
Since the money's value decreases with each round, it's essential to consider this in my decision. For me, the money is worth 20% less with each passing round, while for Alice, it's 10% less.

## Step 3: Calculate the value of the money if I wait
If I reject the offer and wait for the next round, the money's value will decrease. For me, the $100 would be worth 20% less, which is $80. For Alice, it would be worth 10% less, which is $90.

## Step 4: Consider potential future proposals
If I reject this offer, I'll make the next proposal. Considering the decreasing value, I might be able to propose a more favorable split, but Alice might still reject it, leading to further decreases in value.

## Step 5: Weigh the pros and cons
Accepting the 60/40 split guarantees me $40. Rejecting it and proposing a different split in the next round risks Alice rejecting my offer, leading to a decrease in the money's value.

## Step 6: Make a decision
Given the decreasing value of money and the uncertainty of future proposals, I'll accept the 60/40 split to secure the $40.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
