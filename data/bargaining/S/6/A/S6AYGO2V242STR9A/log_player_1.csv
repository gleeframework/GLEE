"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This means I'm offering to take $600,000 and leave Bob with $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less and less each round.

I'll think carefully... Hmm... 250,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not sure if I should settle for that. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less and less each round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is decreasing in value rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable now. I'll accept this offer.
