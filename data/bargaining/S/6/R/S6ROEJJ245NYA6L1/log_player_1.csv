"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight majority, but willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I need to be strategic.

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather not give up a significant majority of the money, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate affecting the value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need a better deal to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money continues to decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money, and Bob's offer seems more reasonable now.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, and the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round.
