Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very simple offer. I'm keeping most of the money, but giving Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even with the 5% inflation, I'm getting a significantly larger share than in the previous round. It's better to take what I can get now than to risk getting even less in the next round."
