Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This is a fair split and it avoids further losses for me due to inflation. Accept this now, or it will be less appealing for you in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
