"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100 and leaving 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's make it a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

Since my gain in the second round is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my gain as 80% of 80, which is 64.

Now, let's look at Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: 40
* Bob gain: 60

This is a good deal for me, as I'm getting more than my calculated gain of 64. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
