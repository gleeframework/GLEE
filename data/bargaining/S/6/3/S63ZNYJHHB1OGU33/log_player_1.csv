"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I propose that Alice receives $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. This seems like a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's better to secure a larger share now than risk getting less in the next round."
