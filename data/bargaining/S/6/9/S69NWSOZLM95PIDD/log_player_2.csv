I'm going to reject this offer.  I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 6:4 split is a better starting point. Let's see if we can reach a deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, let's try 48:52 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This is a good deal for me, and it seems like Alice is being more reasonable. I'll take it."
