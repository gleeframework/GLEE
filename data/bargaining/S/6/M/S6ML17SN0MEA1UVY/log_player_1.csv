"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I'll start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to get this over quickly.  I'm aiming for a large share, but also trying to make it worthwhile for Bob to accept early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best choice.  The inflation is going to quickly make any further negotiation pointless.  Getting 50% is better than risking getting nothing at all."
