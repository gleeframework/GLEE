"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer is a starting point. I believe it is a fair split given the potential for inflation. I'm hoping to secure a deal early on and avoid the risk of losing money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is not favorable to me. While I'm willing to be flexible, his offer is too far in his favor. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even split this round. The inflation rate is starting to impact both of us, and I believe this is a fair way to avoid further losses. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, Bob's offer is close to the even split I proposed earlier. Accepting this offer will secure me a substantial amount of money despite the losses due to inflation. It's better than risking further losses in the next round."
