I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. This gives me a good starting point and hopefully leaves Bob with enough to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I still believe I need a larger portion to make this worthwhile after the inflation hit.  I'm hoping this offer is enough to persuade Bob to accept."
