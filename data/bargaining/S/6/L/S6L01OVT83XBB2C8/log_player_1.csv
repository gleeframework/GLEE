"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth 5% less, I think this offer is slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer. I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Bob's money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'm still getting a slightly larger share, but not so much that Bob will reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I think this offer is more favorable to me than my previous offer. However, I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer.
