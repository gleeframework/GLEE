Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```

  ""bob_gain"": 2000

```
I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gains are worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
I'll wait for a better offer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```
I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 30%."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing my gains by 27.1% from the first round, I need to be even more cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a 50-50 split, which seems reasonable given the circumstances."
