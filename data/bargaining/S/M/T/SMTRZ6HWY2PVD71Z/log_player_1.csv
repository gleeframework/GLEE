Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a decent amount right away, rather than risking the value of the money decreasing in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer. While my money is worth less due to inflation, it's only 10% less.  I'm still better off rejecting and making a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm offering an even split this time. Given the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was so unfavorable, I think this is a fair compromise."
