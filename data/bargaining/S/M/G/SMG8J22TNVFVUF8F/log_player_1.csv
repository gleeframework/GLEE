"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount to start, and I'm keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. I reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a slightly higher share than before, but still keeping a larger portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take control now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take control! I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, $4,000 is a relatively small amount for me, but it's still more than I would get if I reject and the game continues. I'll accept Bob's offer.
