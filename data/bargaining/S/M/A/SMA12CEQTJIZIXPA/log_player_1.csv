"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm now considering the value of the money. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I still value it at $5000. However, Bob's gain is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4800.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a good one, and I'll accept it.
