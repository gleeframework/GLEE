**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, knowing that the value decreases for me over time. While her offers have inched closer to a fairer split, they are still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable in the next round or two as the deadline approaches."
