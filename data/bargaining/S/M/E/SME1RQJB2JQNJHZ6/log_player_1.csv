"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a relatively fair offer, giving Bob 10% and keeping 90% for myself. I figure this gives Bob a good incentive to accept, and I still get a large share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a classic example of the ultimatum game. While Bob's offer is technically better than what he offered in the previous round,  it is unfair and I'm confident I can get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to 850,000 for myself, giving Bob 150,000.  While this is still a significant gain for me, it acknowledges that Bob's offer was unfair. I believe this is a more reasonable split that shows flexibility, and it increases the chances of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and although I'm losing more with each round, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and hope for a more reasonable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

This is my final offer. It's a significant drop from my initial proposal, reflecting the ongoing inflation and Bob's increasingly unfair counteroffers. However, I believe it's a reasonable split that still gives me a majority share while offering Bob a decent portion. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as the value of the money is continuing to decrease."
