"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I need to consider that. My current gain of 500,000 is actually equivalent to 550,000 in the first round's value. That's a good deal, considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
