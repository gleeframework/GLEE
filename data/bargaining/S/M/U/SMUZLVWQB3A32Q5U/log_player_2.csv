"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer is very unfair. While it's true that the money is worth less each round, I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me only 10% of the money. I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. A fair deal for both of us.""}
