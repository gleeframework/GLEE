Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob, let's make a deal.  I'm willing to drop a little more, but I need a bigger piece of the pie than your last offer. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, knowing the value of the money decreases for me each round. While $200,000 is a significant sum, accepting a deal this early heavily favors Alice.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a fairer share, even with the inflation working against me."

""alice_gain"": 450000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the end here. I'm making a final concession to get this done. You're still getting a significant share, and this avoids both of us getting nothing. Let's be smart and close this out. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is turning up the pressure and using the shrinking pot as leverage, but her ""final concession"" is still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting now would mean losing a huge chunk of the initial potential value. It's a risk, but I need to hold out for a better deal, even this late in the game."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point.  Accept this and we both win.  Reject it, and we both lose everything. Don't be greedy, Alice!""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's a high-risk, high-reward play. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the inflation is severely eroding my potential gains. Waiting longer significantly hurts my position.
* **Strong Stance:** A 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the inflation disadvantage I'm facing. This shows Alice I'm serious about not accepting a lopsided deal.
* **Ultimatum:** Framing it as a final offer creates a sense of urgency. Alice is smart and likely realizes that continued refusal risks a complete loss for both of us. 

While there's no guarantee Alice will accept, this approach gives us the best chance of reaching a fair deal before time runs out."
