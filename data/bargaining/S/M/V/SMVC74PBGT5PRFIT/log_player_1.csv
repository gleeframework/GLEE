"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate from there""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth $6,400.

I'm not sure about splitting it evenly, as it's still a significant amount. I'd like to propose a slightly more skewed split in my favor. However, I'll accept Bob's offer for now and see how it plays out.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
