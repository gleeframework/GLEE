"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, considering inflation! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not in my favor considering the rapid inflation for her. If we don't reach a deal soon, the money will be practically worthless to her, giving her a stronger incentive to make a deal heavily favoring me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and the money is losing value fast. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:**  The ""final offer"" approach creates a sense of urgency and finality, potentially pushing Alice to accept.
* **Favorable Split:** While 65/35 is a significant split in my favor, it's becoming increasingly reasonable given the rapid devaluation of the money for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:**  Delaying further significantly hurts both players, but especially Alice. This offer takes advantage of that pressure."
