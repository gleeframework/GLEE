Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round.  Since the money loses value for me each round, I want to secure as much as possible early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd love to get more money, the inflation is going to eat away at my gains if I keep rejecting.  Taking $1000 now is better than risking getting nothing later."
