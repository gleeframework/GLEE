Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split is the most reasonable starting point. This way we can avoid further rounds and  potential losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
