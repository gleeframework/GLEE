"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the smaller share to make it easier to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. My message is a hint that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm starting with a strong offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 10% less for me now.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less for me, I'd like to get a bigger share. However, I'm willing to compromise.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think this is a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 5500:4500 split, with me getting a bit more than Bob. My message is a gentle nudge towards a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 27.1% less for me now, which is a significant decrease.

Considering Bob's offer, I think he's trying to get a bigger share, but I'm not convinced it's fair. Since the money is worth less for me, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the loss in value.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need to make sure I'm not left with too little""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4200:5800 split, with me getting a bit more than Bob. My message is a hint that I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a bigger share and making sure I don't get too little."
