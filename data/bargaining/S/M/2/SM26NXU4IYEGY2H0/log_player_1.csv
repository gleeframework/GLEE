"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

In the first round, I was offered $8,000, which is now worth 80% of its original value. To find the equivalent value in the second round, I'll multiply $8,000 by 80% (0.8).

$8,000 Ã— 0.8 = $6,400

Since Bob's offer in the second round is $6,000, which is less than the equivalent value of my initial offer, I'll accept this offer.
