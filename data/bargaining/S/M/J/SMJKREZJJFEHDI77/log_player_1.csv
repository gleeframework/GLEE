"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep most of it 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the offer from Bob.

I'll think about it... Considering the inflation, I'd rather get more now than less later. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
