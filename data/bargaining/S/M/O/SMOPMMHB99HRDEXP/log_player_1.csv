"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90/10, it's a fair start.""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to keep him interested in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point. We can both get a significant portion of the money. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, the offer from Bob is actually a bit more attractive than it initially seems.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
