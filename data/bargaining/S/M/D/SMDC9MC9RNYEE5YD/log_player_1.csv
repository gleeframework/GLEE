I'm starting with a very simple offer.  I want to keep the vast majority of the money, but I'm giving Bob a little something to hopefully incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal.  It's my turn to make an offer, and I'll try to be a little more fair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more balanced.  I'm willing to give Bob a larger share, but I'm still aiming to get a majority of the money. Let's see if this is more appealing to him."
