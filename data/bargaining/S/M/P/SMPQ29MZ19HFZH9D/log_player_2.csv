Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is right that she's compromising, the deal is still not advantageous to me. The inflation is hurting her more than it's hurting me. It's risky, but I'll hold out for a slightly better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out and inflation is eating our money! This is my final offer.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting.  Alice needs to understand that waiting longer means less for both of us.
* **Exploiting Inflation:**  Alice's losses are accelerating faster than mine. This offer, while still slightly in my favor, might look appealing to her given the circumstances.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I create a sense of urgency and force her to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I won't go below this. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with the time pressure and accelerating inflation, accepting is the less risky option now:

* **Time is Money:** Only 5 rounds remain. Holding out for a slightly better deal might result in us both getting nothing.
* **Alice is Standing Firm:** Her language suggests she won't budge much. Risking further rounds might result in even worse offers from her. 
* **Guaranteed Something:** While not ideal, accepting guarantees me something rather than risking a complete loss."
