"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob.  It's a big chunk for me, but I want to see if Bob will be willing to accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's not ideal, but with inflation kicking in, it's better to take 5000 now than risk getting nothing."
