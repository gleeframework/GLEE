"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it in a way that we both get a good amount. I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer seems fair at first, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  It's risky, but I'm hoping to leverage the inflation to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're looking out for yourself, but I think my initial offer was more fair. I'll compromise a bit, but I still think I should get the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to get the bigger share.  I'm going to stick to my guns and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm not happy with the inflation, but I think I can still improve my position."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is taking its toll, but I still believe I should get the larger share. I'm willing to compromise, but not too much. This is my revised offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still holding on to a larger share, and while I appreciate the compromise, I'm not ready to accept this offer. I'll keep pushing for a more balanced split. Inflation is a big factor, but I'm not giving up."
