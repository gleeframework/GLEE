"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

This offer splits the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal for me. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a significant difference in our shares. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, as I'd like to get a more equitable share. It's still early in the game, so I'm willing to keep negotiating. Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I want to keep the majority""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount."
