Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower offer, but still a good deal. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less now, but I'd rather get something than nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
