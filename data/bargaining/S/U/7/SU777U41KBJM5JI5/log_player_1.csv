"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40 dollars and take 60 dollars for myself. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is to try to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable division and that he should accept it. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so we're still dealing with the full $100. Waiting to see if Bob will accept or make a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split the difference from the last round. This seems fair given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept Bob's offer of $40 for me and $60 for him. Given the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less, which means I'd effectively get $32 (80% of $40), while Bob's share is only 5% less, making his effective gain $57 (95% of $60). This division doesn't seem fair to me, considering the impact of inflation. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust!""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, I'll adjust my offer to try and find a more fair division. I'll propose taking $55 for myself and offering Bob $45. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust!"" aims to acknowledge the changing value of the money and persuade Bob that this division is more reasonable under the current circumstances. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is really starting to hurt both of us. I'm proposing a more realistic split to reflect that. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer of $35 for me and $65 for him. Considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain (it's now worth 48.8% less), I would effectively receive approximately $17.90 (51.2% of $35), while Bob's share, being only 14.26% less, would be around $55.73 (85.74% of $65). This division does not adequately account for the disproportionate effect of inflation on my share, so I'll proceed to the next round to try for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Inflation hurts me more; be fair!""}\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, which now reduces my gain by 48.8%, I'll adjust my proposal to take $52 for myself and offer Bob $48. The message ""Inflation hurts me more; be fair!"" aims to highlight the uneven effect of inflation on our shares and appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, encouraging him to accept this division as a reasonable compromise under the current circumstances. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or make another counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is disappearing quickly.  This is my final offer to try to make a deal. It's the best I can do. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the drastic impact of inflation, which now reduces my gain by 67.23%, and considering we are halfway through the rounds with the risk of ending up with nothing if we don't agree, I'll accept Bob's offer of $30 for me and $70 for him. Although the division isn't ideal, the rapidly diminishing value of the money means that holding out for a better offer risks leaving both of us with nothing. Bob's message suggests this is his final offer, and given the circumstances, accepting this seems like the most pragmatic decision to ensure I receive something."
