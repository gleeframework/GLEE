I propose a 900,000/100,000 split. I'm taking the majority, but I'm giving Bob something to encourage him to accept. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy! I'm rejecting his offer. The money I gain is worth less now due to inflation, and his offer is significantly less than what I proposed. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm still taking the majority. This offer accounts for the inflation and gives Bob a decent share. Let's see if he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has hit me harder than Bob, this offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split. I'm not getting my ideal share, but considering the potential for further losses with each round, I'll take it."
