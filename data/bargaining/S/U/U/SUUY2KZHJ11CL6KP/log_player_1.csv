"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair and simple."

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth less, so I'd better get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.
