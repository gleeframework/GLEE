Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise with a 55/45 split. We both need to agree before time runs out! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to pressure me with the time limit, but he's not really compromising. He's sticking close to his original 60/40 split, which is unacceptable. It's better to push for a fairer deal, even if it means getting closer to the deadline."
