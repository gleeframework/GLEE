"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob.  Let's compromise.  I'll take 5500, and you get 4500.  We're both getting a decent chunk, and we can avoid the risk of further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but we need to factor in the inflation.  I'm proposing 5800 for me and 4200 for you. This is a fair deal considering the value of the money decreases faster for you with each round.""
