  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This is my offer, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal since the money is worth less after inflation.

```

  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting your offer. I'll make a new proposal that's more favorable to me.""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round and another 20% less after the second round, the effective value of the money is now 40% of the original amount.

I'll make a more aggressive offer to account for the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than the original amount, the effective value is now very low.

I'll have to be careful with my next move, but I think I can do better than a 50-50 split.

Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 67.23% less than the original amount, Bob's offer is actually a significant increase from his previous offer. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept.
