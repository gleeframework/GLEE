Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and maximize my share in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less to me later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees I get at least half of the money.  With each round, my share is worth less due to inflation, so it's better to secure something now rather than risk getting nothing later."
