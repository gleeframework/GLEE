Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  My offer is $55 for me and $45 for you. This is the same split you offered me, but the value has decreased for both of us due to inflation. Take the deal now before it gets worse! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
