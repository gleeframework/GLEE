Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share of the money, while still leaving something for Bob. It's a fair starting point, and if he rejects it, the money will be worth less to him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation rate makes this a good deal for me.  I'll accept to avoid further losses."
