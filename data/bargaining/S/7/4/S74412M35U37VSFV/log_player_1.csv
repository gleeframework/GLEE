"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10.  This is a good starting point, leaving a lot of room for negotiation if Bob wants to continue the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best choice.  The inflation means my share is significantly reduced if we continue, and Bob's offer is still better than getting nothing."
