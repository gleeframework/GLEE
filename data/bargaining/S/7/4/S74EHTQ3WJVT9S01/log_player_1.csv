"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us receiving $500,000. This is a good starting point, and I think it's a fair way to begin the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll still give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking. I'll also keep in mind that Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm hoping to do better in the next round.
