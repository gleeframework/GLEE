"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as it offers a significant advantage to me, while still leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This offer is significantly better than the outcome of rejecting and playing another round.  Even though I am getting less than what I initially proposed, the inflation will make the next round's potential gains even lower, making this a good deal for me."
