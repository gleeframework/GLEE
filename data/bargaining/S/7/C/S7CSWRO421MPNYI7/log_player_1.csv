"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm the first mover! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice's gain: 4000 * 0.9 = 3600
Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as I'd be getting a smaller share than in the initial proposal. However, I don't want to risk getting an even worse offer in the next round.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
