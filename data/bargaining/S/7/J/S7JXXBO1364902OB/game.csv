650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, let's start off on a fair note. This offer gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation, but it's a good deal for both of us in the long run. What do you say?",Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand your concerns about the first offer, and I'm willing to compromise. This offer is more balanced, but still acknowledges that inflation affects me less than you. It's important to find a deal sooner rather than later. Let's settle this.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is decreasing with every round. My previous offer was fair, and I'm sticking to a similar split. Let's be pragmatic and finalize this.",Bob,4,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a straight 50/50 split to end this pointless back and forth.  Take it before the money shrinks even further.",Alice,5,
