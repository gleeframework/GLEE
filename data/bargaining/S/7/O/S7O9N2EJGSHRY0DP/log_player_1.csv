"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair balance considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation rate is 10% for me, but only 5% for you. I'm willing to give you a smaller share to increase my chances of getting a better deal in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
