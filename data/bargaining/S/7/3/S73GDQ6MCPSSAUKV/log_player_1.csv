"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
This offer ensures you get the maximum possible in this round, but leaves room for Bob to potentially make a counter-offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 98, ""bob_gain"": 2}
``` 
 
This is a slightly more balanced offer, acknowledging Bob's potential to take a larger share in the next round. It still gives me the majority of the money while leaving a small incentive for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 97, ""bob_gain"": 3}
``` 
 
I'm sticking to the pattern of offering a slightly higher amount to Bob each round. This keeps the pressure on him, and hopefully he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept before we reach the later rounds and the stakes get even higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3 
# Bob gain: 97 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 96, ""bob_gain"": 4}
``` 
 
Continuing the pattern, I'm offering Bob $4 this time.  With only a few rounds left, I hope the pressure is mounting for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4 
# Bob gain: 96 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

We're nearing the end, and the stakes are higher. This is my last attempt to get a majority of the money. Hopefully Bob will realize that he's better off accepting this offer than risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Even though we're in the final rounds, Bob is still offering me a very small share. I'm confident that I can get a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest solution, and it's the only way to ensure that both of us get something. If Bob rejects this offer, we both walk away with nothing. I believe he will recognize this and accept."
