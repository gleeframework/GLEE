"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly biased start, but I'll give you a chance to adjust 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems a bit skewed towards him, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more advantageous proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm adjusting for the inflation, let's try a more balanced split this time!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for a compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being a bit stubborn. Considering the continued inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next proposal. However, I'll accept Bob's offer this time, as it's still a decent split and I don't want to risk losing more value with each passing round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer and ending the game."
