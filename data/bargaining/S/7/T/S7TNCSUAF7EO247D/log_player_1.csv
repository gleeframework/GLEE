"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount of money and can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, let's compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the new values are:

Alice's gain: $4,000 (worth 90% of $4,400)
Bob's gain: $6,000 (worth 80% of $7,500)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is trying to compromise, I'll accept his offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
