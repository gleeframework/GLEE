"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair compromise, considering the initial 3:1 ratio was a bit harsh. This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
