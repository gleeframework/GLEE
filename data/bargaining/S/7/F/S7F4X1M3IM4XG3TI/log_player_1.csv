Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid the risk of inflation eating away at the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though my share is much lower, it's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all due to inflation."
