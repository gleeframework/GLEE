"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. I think it's fair considering the potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'll reject the offer.  While it's tempting to take the $40, I think I can do better by waiting and seeing if Alice will give me a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I think we should split the money more evenly, with a 60/40 split in my favor. This recognizes the potential inflation and gives us both a fair share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split of the money, 50/50. This ensures fairness and acknowledges the risk of inflation affecting both of our shares equally. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Even though the inflation has hit my potential gains hard, getting 50% of the money is a much better outcome than risking further losses by rejecting and potentially getting nothing at all in the end."
