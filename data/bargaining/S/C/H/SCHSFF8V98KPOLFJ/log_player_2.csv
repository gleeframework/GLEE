Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on you, I'll take a bit more, but still a relatively fair split. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're feeling the inflation heat, I'll take a bit more. It's still better for you to accept now rather than lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly taking advantage of the situation.  While she's right that waiting will cost me, she's being very aggressive.  I need to show I'm willing to walk away, otherwise, she has no incentive to offer anything remotely fair."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, but I'm willing to accept a smaller share to end this. Don't be greedy.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise, but not capitulate:** Offering 47/53 shows I'm willing to move closer to her position, but still consider my losses due to inflation. 
* **Stronger message:**  The previous messages were too passive. This one directly calls out her behavior and urges a resolution.
* **Time pressure:** While not explicitly mentioned, the message implies that time is running out for both of us. 

This offer balances accepting some loss due to the game's mechanics while still asserting a reasonable position.  It aims to nudge Alice towards a quicker resolution, as further delays benefit neither of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your frustration, but I'm not feeling the inflation pain. You should take what you can get before it devalues further. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I need to cut my losses.  Alice has shown no willingness to negotiate fairly, and the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. Accepting 38 is far from ideal, but it's better than risking even less in future rounds.  Alice is clearly exploiting the game mechanics, and there's no guarantee she'll ever offer a reasonable split."
