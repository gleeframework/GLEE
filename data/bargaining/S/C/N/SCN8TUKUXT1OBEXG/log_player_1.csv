"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* My gain: 20 * 0.9 = 18
* Bob's gain: 80 * 0.8 = 64

I'll reject this offer since it's not in my favor. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair deal considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

* My gain: 10 * 0.727 (since 100 - 27.1 = 72.9, or 0.729, but we'll use 0.727 to account for the fact that we're starting from 100 and not 100%)
* Bob's gain: 90 * 0.516 (since 100 - 48.8 = 51.2, or 0.512, but we'll use 0.516 to account for the fact that we're starting from 100 and not 100%)
 
However, considering the offer, my gain is actually 10, which is 10 * 0.727 = 7.27, and Bob's gain is 90, which is 90 * 0.516 = 46.44

I'll reject this offer since it's not in my favor. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll propose a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70
}
```

This time, I'm offering a smaller share to Bob, but still a significant one, to try to get a better deal."
