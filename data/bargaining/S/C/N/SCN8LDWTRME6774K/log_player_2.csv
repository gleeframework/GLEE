Let's see if we can do better than that!  I'm going to try for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's split it evenly!  Hopefully, Alice sees the logic in that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to give in to this lowball offer.  I'll try for a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}
```

Let's see if a 40/60 split works.  Alice is getting a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise."
