"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair and reasonable ratio.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 60-40 in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable ratio, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 7:3 is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, Bob is proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting $300,000 and Bob getting $700,000.

I'm not thrilled about the new ratio, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I think I can do better than 3:7. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob due to inflation, and I want to take advantage of this, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money for Bob.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think 50-50 is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for Bob due to inflation, I think a 50-50 split is a good compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game.
