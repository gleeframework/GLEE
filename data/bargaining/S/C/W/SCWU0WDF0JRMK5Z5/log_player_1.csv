"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly.  It's the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, my gain of $8,000 is still $8,000.

However, Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 10% less due to inflation, which is $4,500.

I'd like to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. Here's my message:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it evenly is the best option. I'll think of a new proposal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still thinking about the risk of inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is worth 10% less than his previous offer of $5,000."
