I propose to take 999,999 dollars and leave Bob with 1 dollar.  I know it seems unfair, but remember, inflation will drastically reduce the value of the money for me if we go to the next round.  Let's get this over with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is hitting hard. Accepting this offer means I'll have $100,000 now, whereas if I reject it, the value of my potential gain in the next round would be significantly less due to inflation."
