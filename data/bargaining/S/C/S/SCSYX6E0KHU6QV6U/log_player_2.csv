"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you want a more balanced split, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor. The longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation. I need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I'm willing to make a slightly better offer. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is using the inflation against me, but her concession is still too small. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount to inflation compared to even round 3. I need to hold firm and hope she gets more reasonable."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise that acknowledges your position while minimizing the impact of inflation on my end. Let's be practical and close this deal.""
