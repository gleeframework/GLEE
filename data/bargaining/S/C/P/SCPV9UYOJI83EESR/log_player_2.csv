"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal.  The money is worth less with each round, so I should hold out for a bit."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the money will lose value with each round. Let's agree and move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer benefits you more in the long run, considering the faster inflation on your end. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less for me now, this offer is still better than what I was able to secure in Round 2.  It's important to consider the inflation, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
