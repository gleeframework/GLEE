Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split.  I'm willing to take a small risk, hoping that he'll accept this offer rather than risk the next round and the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with inflation, a 50/50 split is a fair offer. It's better than risking another round where I might get a worse deal, especially since I don't know how the inflation is affecting Bob."
