Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll give a bit more, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is acknowledging inflation, the offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  It's time to play hardball. The decreasing value of the money for me means we need to settle this sooner rather than later."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Alice, inflation is working against us. I'm offering a slight majority to reflect the time pressure. Let's close this deal and both get something.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed a factor, but I still think my share should be higher considering the initial value. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting increasingly dire. While the offer isn't ideal, accepting now guarantees something before inflation further diminishes my potential gains. Waiting any longer significantly risks ending up with nothing at all."
