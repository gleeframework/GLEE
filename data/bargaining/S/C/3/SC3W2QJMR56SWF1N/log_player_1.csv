"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60% now, but you can try to do better in the next round 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, the offer is not as appealing as it seems.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

# Alice gain: 3500
