```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself!

I'm not too thrilled about giving him 60% of the money, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more!""

```

I'm offering Bob a 55% share, which is a slight improvement from his previous offer. Let's see if he'll accept!"

Round 4

# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still trying to get the better deal!

I'm not happy with a 35-65 split, as it's still heavily biased towards Bob. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 65-35 in his favor, I'll try to make a stronger counteroffer to get a better deal for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 58% share, which is a slight improvement from my previous offers and a bit closer to a 50-50 split. Let's see if he'll accept!"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I think I can get a better deal than this. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get an even better deal!

I'm getting a bit frustrated with the negotiations, but I'll try to stay calm and think strategically. A 30-70 split is even more skewed in Bob's favor, and I don't think I can afford to give up that much more. I'll reject this offer and try to make a stronger counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

  ""bob_gain"": 62,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up without a fight! I need a better deal.""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers!

I'm not happy with a 25-75 split, as it's extremely skewed in his favor. I think I've been too generous so far, and it's time to take a firmer stance. I'll reject this offer and try to make a more assertive counteroffer. Here's my response:

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

I'm extremely unhappy with a 10-90 split, as it's extremely skewed in his favor. I've tried to negotiate and make concessions throughout the game, but it seems like Bob is not willing to meet me halfway. I'll reject this offer and accept the fact that we'll both end up with nothing, since we've reached the 12-round limit.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's time to concede defeat and start fresh next time!"
