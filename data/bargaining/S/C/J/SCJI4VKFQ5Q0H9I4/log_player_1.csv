"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer from Round 1 was 600,000 for me and 400,000 for Bob, which is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob. 

Since Bob's offer is less favorable to me, I will reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 2, the money was worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob. So, to adjust for this, I'll aim to offer a higher share to Bob.

Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, the offer from Bob seems more reasonable. It's a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
