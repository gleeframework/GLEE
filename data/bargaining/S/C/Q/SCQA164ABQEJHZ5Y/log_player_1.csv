"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a bit less than half, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly before inflation takes its toll. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This is a more reasonable split considering the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the split seems more reasonable considering the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, I'm effectively getting $360,000 in value (80% of $450,000), which is less than I initially offered Bob. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will see this as a fair and reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 20% less to me in each round, I'm effectively getting $400,000 in value (80% of $500,000) if Bob accepts this offer. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise, and to end the game before the inflation further reduces the value of my gain."
