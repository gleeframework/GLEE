"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000. My message is a friendly one, but also hints at my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gains.

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining money. I'll propose a new deal.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 40% share. I'm willing to negotiate further and propose a new deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is still eating away at the value of the money. Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risks and efforts.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 55% share for myself and 45% for Bob, hoping to find a middle ground and avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target. I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up on getting a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now. Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up my lead. I'll try to push for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can still do better than a 50-50 split. I'm not willing to give up my potential advantage, and I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share considering the risks and efforts.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 60% share for myself and 40% for Bob, hoping to find a better balance and avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up my share too much. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a big bite out of the money now. Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take it. It's getting late, and I don't want to risk losing more value to inflation.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, at this point, I'm worried about the value of the money continuing to erode due to inflation. I think 45% is a fair share, and I don't want to risk waiting for a potentially better deal that might not materialize."
