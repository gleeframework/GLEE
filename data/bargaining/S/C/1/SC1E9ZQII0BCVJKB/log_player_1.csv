```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

* Alice gain: 400000
* Bob gain: 480000

I'm not sure I like this offer. I think I can do better. I'll reject it.

Do you accept this offer?","Wait, I think there's been a mistake! In Round 4, the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, not 48.8%. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, the effective values are:

* Alice gain: 450000
