"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which is a 60/40 split. I'm framing it as a fair split to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's flip the script and start with a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to try to get a better deal. I think I can negotiate a better split for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet you in the middle, Bob. 50/50 split. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more even split than before. I'm framing it as a compromise to see if Bob will accept it."
