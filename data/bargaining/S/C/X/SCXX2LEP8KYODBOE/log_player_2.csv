"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share this round, but we can work things out in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice is hinting at future generosity, the potential losses from inflation are too great to accept such an uneven split. Bob needs to negotiate for a fairer share in this round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I need a larger share to offset the inflation. This offer is still generous to you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to give up some of my share, but we need to start working together to avoid losing too much to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is budging, but this offer is still unacceptable.  While the inflation is starting to hurt her more, a 40/60 split heavily favors Alice in the long run. Bob needs to hold firm and push for a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. I'm offering a reasonable split that accounts for inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid losing any more money.""
}
