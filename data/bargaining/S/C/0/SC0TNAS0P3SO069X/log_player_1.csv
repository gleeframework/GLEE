"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since you have more to lose from the inflation, I believe this is a fair starting point. Let's see what you think!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to compromise and offer a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the inflation we've both experienced, and hopefully, it's a better starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, acknowledging the continued inflation. It's a reasonable compromise, and I hope Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Given the continued rejection and increasing inflation, I believe a 50/50 split is the only fair option to ensure we both get something. This is a true compromise, and hopefully, Bob will finally see reason."
