"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm losing money to inflation every round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With inflation affecting Alice's money, I might be able to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I should get a bit more. This is a fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm losing money with every round we play. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\nI'll reject this offer. Since Alice's money is losing value with each round and she's getting anxious, I might be able to negotiate an even better deal in the next round. Her ""final offer"" sounds like a bluff, and I'm willing to take the risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I know your money is worth less now. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances.""}"
