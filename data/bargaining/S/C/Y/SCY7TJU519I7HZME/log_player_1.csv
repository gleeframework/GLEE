"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is a more balanced starting point, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 65-35 split, especially since I'm gaining less in terms of purchasing power. I'd like to keep pushing for a more balanced split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 split?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and balanced proposal. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
