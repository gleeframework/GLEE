"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a split where I get $999,000 and Bob gets $1,000. This is a very generous offer to start, considering the inflation factor will likely benefit Bob more in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money.  Given the inflation factor and the risk of getting nothing in later rounds, it's a wise choice to accept."
