# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you another chance 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on with the decreasing pot, accepting now sets a dangerous precedent. Alice knows I'm getting less each round and may continue to lowball me.  I'm holding out hope she'll offer a larger share to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be fair. 50/50, no more games.""} 

**Reasoning:**  Time to get serious. The inflation is hurting, and we're past the halfway point. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids the risk of getting nothing. Alice might be getting greedy, but she also risks losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offers, now the deal is worse for you 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's getting too risky now. The inflation is eating into my potential gains significantly, and Alice is clearly willing to play hardball. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
