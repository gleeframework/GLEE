"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant chunk of the money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is still quite generous, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
