"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose taking 90% of the money and leaving Bob with 10%. Since I'm the first to make a proposal, I'm aiming for a high share, but I'm leaving a reasonable amount for Bob to make it worthwhile for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the inflation hurts me, it's still a much better deal than the previous round. I'm taking half the money, which is a significant gain, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round."
