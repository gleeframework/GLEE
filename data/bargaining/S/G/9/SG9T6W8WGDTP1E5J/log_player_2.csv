"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair and simple split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. I think we can work something out! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is unfair, and even though there's a time limit, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal right away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point. We can work from there. ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. It's the fairest way to divide the money, and with inflation taking its toll, it's better to secure something than risk losing more. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a slightly higher share, with the time limit and inflation, a 50/50 split is a fair and secure outcome."
