"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you take 10%, we can both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this scenario, accepting the offer would result in Bob gaining only $10, which is a minimal amount compared to the total of $100. Given that the value of the money does not decrease for Bob with each round, there is an incentive to negotiate for a better offer, especially since Alice's gain decreases by 10% each round. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to propose a more favorable division in the next round or potentially receive a better offer from Alice in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, this is a fair deal""}\n\n###\n\nIn this proposal, Bob takes into account the fact that Alice's valuation of the money decreases by 10% each round, but still offers a division that gives her a substantial amount, while also considering his own interests. By proposing a 60-40 split, Bob aims to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to Alice, given the decreasing value of the money for her. This approach shows a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution, while also taking into account the strategic implications of the game's rules."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%. Let's split it 55/45. This is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current state of the game and the impact of inflation on Alice's valuation, accepting a 55-45 split may still not be the most advantageous decision for Bob. Since the money's value does not decrease for Bob, there's an opportunity to push for a more favorable division. Additionally, Alice's willingness to compromise indicates that she may be open to further negotiations. By rejecting this offer, Bob maintains the pressure on Alice, considering her decreasing valuation of the money, and keeps the door open for either a better proposal from Alice in the next rounds or the chance to make another proposal himself that could result in a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact on your valuation, I believe this split is more aligned with the current state of the game""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Bob adjusts his proposal to reflect the decreasing value of the money for Alice. By increasing his share to 65% and decreasing Alice's share to 35%, Bob is applying pressure based on the strategic advantage provided by the inflation mechanism. This offer still leaves room for negotiation but is more assertive in reflecting the changing valuation dynamics between the players. The message aims to justify the proposal based on the game's progression and the impact of inflation, framing it as a reasonable adjustment rather than an overly aggressive move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. 40/60 is a fair split considering the inflation and the dwindling rounds. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice's offer of a 40-60 split is the most favorable to Bob so far, and it aligns with his previous proposal that considered the inflation impact. Given that the value of the money for Bob does not decrease, securing 60% of the original amount is a significant gain. The fact that Alice is willing to meet halfway and end the game suggests that she is under pressure from the decreasing value of her potential gain due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures Bob a substantial amount without risking further negotiations that could potentially lead to less favorable outcomes or even the loss of the entire amount if the 12 rounds conclude without an agreement."
