Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  While $100,000 is a decent amount, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I know the money is worth less with each round, but I think there's room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest and most likely to be accepted."
