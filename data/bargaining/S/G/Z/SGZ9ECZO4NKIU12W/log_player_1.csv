"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6000 is now worth 80% of $6000, which is $4800 in real value.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's better than rejecting it and risking an even worse offer in the next round. I'll accept this offer to get a guaranteed $4800.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
