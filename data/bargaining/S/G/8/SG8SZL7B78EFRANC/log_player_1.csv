"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, giving Bob a chance to respond and potentially start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the upcoming rounds and the potential for inflation.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move by Bob!

Considering the inflation factor, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less than his initial proposal, I'll take that into account.

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 60-40 split just yet. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation factor and the potential for future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise on a slightly larger share for myself. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to take into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm offering a slightly more favorable share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer a 55/45 split to avoid further inflation losses. It's a fair deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the accelerated inflation, I'll reassess the situation. Since Bob's offer is worth 14.26% less than his initial proposal, I'll take that into account.

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is fair, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that takes into account the increasing inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the rapid inflation, I'm taking a more aggressive stance. I need a larger share to maintain my purchasing power.""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to 60% to account for the accelerating inflation and the decreasing value of the money. I'm hoping this will give me a better chance of securing a larger portion of the remaining funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing value with each passing round. I'm willing to go back to the original 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option given the current circumstances, and we can avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A return to the original 50-50 split!

Considering the rapidly increasing inflation, I'm starting to think that taking a smaller share now might be a better option than risking further losses. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we'll split the remaining $1,000,000 50-50. It's not the largest share I could have gotten, but it's a fair compromise given the circumstances, and it avoids further losses due to inflation."
