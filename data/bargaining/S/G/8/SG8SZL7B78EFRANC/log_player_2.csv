It's always good to be a little greedy at the start.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the upcoming rounds and the potential for inflation.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""}

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise on a slightly larger share for myself. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I still think we can do better than a 45/55 split, especially considering the inflation. Let's keep negotiating."

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is becoming too unfavorable, and the inflation is hitting me hard.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept this big of a loss.  Let's try to find a more balanced solution."
