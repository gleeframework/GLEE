Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  I'm not sure why you think you deserve more, but I'm willing to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down a bit, but this offer is as fair as it gets considering the time pressure.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly. We're both losing money with each round, so there's no reason to fight over a few dollars. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Taking inflation into account, getting $50 now is better than risking getting a worse deal later. Bob is unlikely to offer anything better."
