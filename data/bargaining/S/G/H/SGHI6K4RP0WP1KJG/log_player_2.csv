"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Bob, considering the risk and uncertainty of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer seems generous,  it's better to see if I can get a better deal in later rounds. I'll see if I can get more than 2500, especially since the money is losing value with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 9000,

""message"": ""I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This acknowledges the risk of inflation, but offers me a larger share considering the potential value loss in subsequent rounds.  Let's work together to maximize our gains in the remaining rounds.""
