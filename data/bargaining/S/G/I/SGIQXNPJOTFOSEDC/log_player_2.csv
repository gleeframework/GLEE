"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Reason:While the offer seems fair on the surface, Bob is losing more value with each round due to the higher inflation rate. It's better to make a counter-offer in the next round and aim for a slightly better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Your offer was generous, Alice, but the inflation hits me harder. How about this slightly adjusted split?""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:** Bob understands that delaying an agreement hurts him more than Alice. He needs to secure a deal quickly.
* **Fairness and Urgency:**  The offer is still generous to Alice, reflecting the initial fairness of her proposal. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message acknowledges Alice's previous offer while highlighting the need for adjustment due to the asymmetric inflation impact."
