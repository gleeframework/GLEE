Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, as I get the larger share but Bob still receives something.  I want to see if he's willing to negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower split in my favor, but still keep the offer relatively fair. Since Bob rejected my previous proposal, I'm willing to compromise a bit but still maintain a strong majority share. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while also holding firm to my initial desire for a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm still getting less than what I originally wanted, I'm concerned about inflation. The value of the money I receive keeps decreasing, so it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
