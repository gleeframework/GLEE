"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and consider the inflation, I'll get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division where I get $55 and Bob gets $45. Given the inflation rates, I believe this is a fair starting point as I'm considering the devaluation of money for both of us but also want to ensure I get a slightly larger share for making the first offer. The message to Bob emphasizes fairness and the impact of inflation, aiming to set a reasonable tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I know the money is losing value, but it's better than nothing, right? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, although the split seems even, the inflation affects us differently. Given that the money I gain is worth 5% less and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, an even split doesn't account for the unequal devaluation of our shares. I believe I can propose a division in the next round that better reflects the impact of inflation on our earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation difference, I'll take a bit more to balance it out""}\n\nIn this round, I'll increase my share to $58 and offer Bob $42. Given that the money I gain is worth 5% less and Bob's share is worth 10% less, I believe this division better accounts for the unequal impact of inflation on our earnings. My message to Bob aims to justify this split by highlighting the need to balance out the devaluation of our shares."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, Alice. It's getting riskier with each round, and I think we should aim for a deal before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his willingness to give me a bit more, the division he proposes doesn't adequately reflect the impact of inflation on our earnings. With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less and Bob's share being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I believe his offer of $45 for me and $55 for him doesn't sufficiently account for the unequal devaluation of our shares. I'll aim to propose a more balanced division in the next round, considering the increasing risk and devaluation of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us hard, I'll take more to compensate for the risk""}\n\nIn this round, I'll increase my share to $60 and offer Bob $40. Given the significant impact of inflation on our earnings, with my share being worth 14.26% less and Bob's share being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I believe this division better reflects the risk and devaluation of the money. My message to Bob emphasizes the need to compensate for this risk, aiming to justify the proposed split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the end of this. It's time to find a middle ground. Let's split it 48/52, I think we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accept Bob's offer because, at this point in the game, the impact of inflation is significantly reducing the value of the money for both of us. With my share being worth 22.62% less and Bob's share being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, finding a middle ground becomes increasingly important to avoid further devaluation. Bob's offer of a 48/52 split in my favor seems reasonable, considering the risk of proceeding to further rounds where the money could become even less valuable. Accepting this offer ensures that both of us walk away with something, rather than risking getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
