I'm still hoping for a better deal. It's too early to accept this offer, even with the inflation. Let's see if we can get closer to a 50/50 split."

It's getting risky, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I need more than 40% to make this worthwhile, especially with the inflation. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit more in the next round."
