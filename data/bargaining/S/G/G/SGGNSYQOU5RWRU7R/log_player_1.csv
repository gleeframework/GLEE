"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the advantage I have with the inflation rate.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. This split reflects the inflation impact on both of us, and I hope it's fair enough for us to move forward. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting as it's more than I would get if I reject and get my way in the next round. However, accepting sets a precedent for him to keep offering me less.  Let's negotiate. 

```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's find a solution that works for both of us. This offer accounts for the inflation impact and offers a fairer split. I believe this is a good starting point for a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is carefully inching his offer closer to his desired outcome. While I would get more if I reject and get my way in the next round, the risk is too high now. The inflation is eating into the potential gains.
