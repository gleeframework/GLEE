Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less for me with each round, I want to secure as much as possible now.  Bob might not accept, but it's worth a shot!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though this is a terrible deal for me, I'm going to accept it.  With each round, the value of my share decreases rapidly. I'm better off taking a tiny portion now than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
