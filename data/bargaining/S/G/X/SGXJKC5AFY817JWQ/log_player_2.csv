"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk to start with. Accept and we're done.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  It's still a significant share for you, Bob, but I'm not going lower.  If you reject, the value of the money keeps shrinking for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hitting her much harder than me. I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable in the next round to avoid losing even more value."
