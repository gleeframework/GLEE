"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going for a very greedy opening offer.  Since inflation is a factor, I want to maximize my share as quickly as possible.  This should either tempt Bob to accept, or make him more likely to offer me a more generous share in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action. Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous one, and  I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round given the inflation factor."
