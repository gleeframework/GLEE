Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see you're willing to go 50/50 now, but I've taken more risk by rejecting your previous offers. This is my compromise.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer in round 4 mirrors my initial offer in round 1.  Given the time pressure and inflation already eating into the potential gains, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  

Waiting any longer carries significant risk:

* **Bob might get greedier:**  He might be emboldened to push for an even larger share in subsequent rounds.
* **Inflation's impact worsens:**  Each round makes the potential winnings less appealing. 

Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even if it means Bob gets a slight advantage."
