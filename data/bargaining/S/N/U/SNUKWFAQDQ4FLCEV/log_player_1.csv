"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and it's a good way to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively equal split."

# Bob gain: 600000
