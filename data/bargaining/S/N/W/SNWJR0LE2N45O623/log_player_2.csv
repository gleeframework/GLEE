Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Getting closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is getting closer to a more even split, the rate of inflation is working against me. Accepting this offer would give me $43, which is worth significantly less than it was in Round 1. It's worth holding out for a slightly better deal, as long as I don't get too greedy and risk running out of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  Every round costs us money due to inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome.""}
