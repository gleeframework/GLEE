"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to be more cautious. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I think he's trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject this offer for now. The game is heating up! 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time for me to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation is still affecting Bob's gain, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm offering a slightly skewed split in my favor, hoping to take advantage of the inflation effect."
