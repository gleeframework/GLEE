"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split, keeping the lion's share for myself but giving Bob a small amount to incentivize accepting.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I'm trying to be as fair as possible while still maximizing my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is a blatant power move, flipping the script from the previous round. I won't be bullied into accepting such a drastic shift, especially since I'm already facing a 20% devaluation of my gains due to inflation.  I'll see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 8000, offering Bob 2000.  I want to be fair while also recognizing the inflation that's happening. I believe this offer is still favorable for me, but also gives Bob a good incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation situation, and his offer is extremely unbalanced.  Even though my gains are severely affected by inflation, I won't be forced into accepting such a terrible deal.  I'll try to negotiate a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm further reducing my share to 6000, offering Bob 4000.  This is a compromise, recognizing the significant impact of inflation on my gains, but also attempting to find a middle ground. I hope this offer shows my willingness to negotiate while still securing a decent share of the money."
