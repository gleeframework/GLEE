"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get the rest. We can negotiate further in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While 100,000 dollars is a lot of money, I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal.  Let's see what Alice says in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""That's not how fair deals work, Alice. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  Take it or leave it - the clock is ticking, and the money is literally evaporating.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split. It's a fair offer considering we're both losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is finally budging, but I think I can squeeze a little more out of this deal. It's still early in the game. Let's see if she's willing to go higher."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
