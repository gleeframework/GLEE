"Round 1

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take a smaller share this time, but we can both come out ahead if we keep negotiating. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a more even split, the impact of inflation is becoming significant.  It's important to push for a better deal now before the value diminishes further."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to budge a bit more, but I'm still hoping for a fairer share. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation is becoming severe. While this isn't the ideal split, accepting guarantees Bob a reasonable sum.  Waiting longer risks getting significantly less, especially if Alice is unwilling to budge much further."
