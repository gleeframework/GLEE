"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in this round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

For Round 2, I would have gained 60, but due to inflation, that's equivalent to 54 in the first round's value. Now, Bob's offer is 40, which is equivalent to 36 in the first round's value.

I think I'll reject this offer as well.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}"
