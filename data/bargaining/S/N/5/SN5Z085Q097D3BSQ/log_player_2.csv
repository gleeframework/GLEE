Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting the money differently for each of us, I need to consider the relative values carefully. Since Alice's offer is still a 40:60 split, which is a more favorable ratio for me than her previous offer, I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if I should accept it yet.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40:60, I'll try to get a better ratio for myself. I'll offer a 50:50 split, which is a more balanced ratio.
