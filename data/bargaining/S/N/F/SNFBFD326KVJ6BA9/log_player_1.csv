"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively even split to begin with, and I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy, now it's my turn to make a strong move! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a strong move!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you're being generous, but I'm not buying it. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's still too skewed in his favor. I'm hoping he'll come back with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take 55% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 45%. I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but I'm not giving up too much yet."
