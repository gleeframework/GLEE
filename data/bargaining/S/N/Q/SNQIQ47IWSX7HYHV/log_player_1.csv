Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round. I want to see how Bob reacts.  It's risky, but hopefully he'll take it to avoid the chance of getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm aware that the money is losing value with each round.  Taking a 70/30 split is better than risking getting nothing."
