"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split 60/40. A fair deal for both of us in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but my offer ensures we both benefit despite inflation. Let's close the deal.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Countering Alice's Offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. My offer is a counter-proposal that acknowledges her desire for a larger share while still being advantageous to me.
* **Inflation Factor:**  It's crucial to secure a deal quickly. While my offer might seem generous, the longer we wait, the less the money is worth. A 52/48 split in round 2 is better for me than a 60/40 split in round 1 due to inflation. 
* **Strategic Messaging:** My message aims to be persuasive without being confrontational. I want Alice to understand that accepting this offer is a win-win, especially with the looming inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for us. Let's settle this now. I'm taking a slight hit, but it's better than dragging this out further. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Pressure:**  The inflation is really starting to bite. While this offer isn't ideal, accepting a 42/58 split now is better than risking an even worse offer in later rounds. 
* **Alice's Concessions:**  Alice has reduced her demand slightly from the original 60/40 split. This indicates she's feeling the pressure of the game's mechanics and wants to finalize a deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in later rounds is incredibly risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer a more favorable split, and the value of the money will continue to decrease."
