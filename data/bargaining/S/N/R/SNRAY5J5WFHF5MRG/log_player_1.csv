"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 55:45 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation and the risk of losing money in future rounds. This offer allows us both to secure a significant portion of the initial amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
