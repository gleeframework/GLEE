"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a generous offer, leaving Bob with a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point for the negotiation."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll make a new offer that's more aggressive this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
