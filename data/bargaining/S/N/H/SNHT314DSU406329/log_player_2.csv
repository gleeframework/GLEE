**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is working in Bob's favor.  The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice will become to take any deal as her share is diminishing at a much faster rate than Bob's.  Bob can afford to hold out for a slightly better offer in the next round."
