"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start with a very lopsided offer, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further rounds and the potential for inflation to erode his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to accept since the offer is much better than the first round,  the inflation effect means the money I gain is worth less each round. I'll reject and see what Bob proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'll propose an even split this time. Since Bob rejected my initial offer, I believe he's aware of the inflation effect and might be more willing to compromise.  A 50/50 split is fair and offers a decent return for both of us."
