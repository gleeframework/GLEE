"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55:45 split is fair. It's a little closer to a 50/50 split, and I believe we both can benefit from it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
