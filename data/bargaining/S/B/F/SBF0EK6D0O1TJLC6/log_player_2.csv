Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can give a bit, but I still think I deserve the larger share. This is as low as I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is budging, but very slowly. While the effects of inflation are becoming more significant for me, it's still early in the game. Accepting now would give Alice a significant advantage. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a more equitable split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fair split, but I still believe I deserve a bit more. This is my compromise. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on, with inflation eating into my potential gains. However, Alice has only budged by $10,000 from her initial offer. This tells me she is still aiming for a heavily weighted split in her favor. Accepting this offer, even with the time pressure, would set a bad precedent and likely result in a worse outcome than if I hold firm and counter-propose."
