Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the value of money decreases for both of us.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
