I'll propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm going for a big chunk early on, hoping to get this over with quickly before the money loses too much value!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept that! Bob's offer is way too low. I'm going to take a chance and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced proposal this time.  I'll offer Bob 40% since we're both taking a hit from inflation.  Hopefully, he'll see this as a fair compromise."
