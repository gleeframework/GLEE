"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split a bit more than fairly for me this round, considering the inflation and the fact that you'll get to propose next time. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the long game.  Rejecting and proposing next round allows me to leverage the inflation to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity in the last round, but I believe a more balanced split is fairer, especially considering the future rounds where the inflation will impact me more. Let's find a middle ground for a lasting agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about the inflation, Bob, so I've moved a bit closer to a 50/50 split.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still seeing an opportunity to gain more. The inflation is going to impact me significantly in the coming rounds, and I need to make sure I secure a better deal before it becomes too much of a burden."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5050, ""alice_gain"": 4950, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. I'm offering a slightly higher split for you, but it's important we reach a compromise soon to minimize our losses. Let's avoid further rounds of negotiation and find a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right about the losses with each round. I'm willing to meet you halfway with this offer. It's crucial we settle this now to avoid further inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'm still losing out on some potential gains, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting.  The inflation is hitting me hard, and at this point, it's better to accept a slightly less favorable offer and avoid further losses."
