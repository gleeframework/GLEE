"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor. I'm assuming Bob will want to negotiate, but I'm hoping he'll accept this offer rather than risk the possibility of getting less in the next round with inflation kicking in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, I'm still getting a decent amount of money.  It's better to take this offer than risk getting less in the next round."
