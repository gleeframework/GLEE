"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  I'm confident we can find a better deal for both of us in the future, but this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 10% is better than nothing, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further. I'm confident we can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I think it's more fair if we split the money closer to 50/50.  This is a good starting point for a fair deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split feels more fair considering the inflation.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a 50/50 split, accepting this offer is the best option for me.  Inflation is affecting the value of the money, and it's unlikely Alice will be willing to give up more. It's a good deal for both of us."
