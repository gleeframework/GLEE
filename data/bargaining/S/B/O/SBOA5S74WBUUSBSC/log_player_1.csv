"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself. Since this is the first round and the value of the money hasn't decreased yet, I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of getting less in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much better for him than my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a significantly smaller share. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  The value of the money is already decreasing, and I'm confident I can get a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly better deal than before, but still maintaining a majority share. I'm hoping that the decreasing value of the money will make him more inclined to accept this offer, as we are now in the third round and the potential for further loss is increasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is starting to seriously impact the value of the money.  I'm confident I can still get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway this round.  I'm offering a 55/45 split, recognizing that the value of the money is decreasing quickly and we need to reach an agreement soon. Hopefully this offer is appealing enough for Bob to accept, as I don't want to risk further losses in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a ridiculous offer from Bob!  The inflation is biting hard now, but I'm still not willing to accept such a small share. I'm confident I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

With the inflation hitting hard, and both of us having rejected several offers already, I think it's time to compromise. This offer is a straight 50/50 split, which seems fair given the circumstances and the dwindling value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept, as I don't want to risk losing even more in the next round."
