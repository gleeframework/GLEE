"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair and balanced division. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it closer to even.  I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'm getting a slightly worse deal than before.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway and accept this compromise."
