"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000. This is a good starting point for me as it's a fair division considering I'm the one making the offer.  Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my previous offer.  I'm going to reject it and see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy as round 1. I'm proposing 8000 for myself and 2000 for Bob. While the total money has decreased due to inflation,  this is a more fair division as I am the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Although the offer is less than what I was aiming for, inflation has hit hard.  The amount I'm getting is 40% of the original $10,000 and it's better than getting nothing at all."
