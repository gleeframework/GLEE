"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm starting off with a generous offer to show good faith, but I'll be willing to negotiate if necessary. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm sticking to my guns and offering a slightly lower split in my favor.  Since the inflation only affects Bob, he should be motivated to accept a slightly less favorable offer.  It's time to see if he understands the value of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. He's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not giving in. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm willing to concede a little bit more to get this deal done.  I'm convinced that Bob will eventually realize that he's better off accepting a fair offer than waiting for the inflation to erode the value of his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more ridiculous. He's clearly not understanding the impact of inflation on his potential gains. I won't be bullied into accepting an unfair deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm trying to strike a balance between what's fair and what's likely to be accepted. I'm getting impatient with Bob's intransigence, but I'm still trying to find a compromise. It's time for him to show some reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unreasonable, and he's clearly not understanding the impact of inflation on his potential gains. I'm getting frustrated, but I'm not going to give in. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to concede further, but I won't go any lower.  I'm hopeful that Bob will finally see that he's losing out on a significant amount of money by refusing to compromise.  Time is running out, and we're both in danger of getting nothing."
