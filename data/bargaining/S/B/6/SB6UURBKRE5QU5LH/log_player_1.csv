I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it, and we can both get some money without risking inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm not going to accept that offer. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a fair split. I think Bob will realize he's being unreasonable if he rejects this."
