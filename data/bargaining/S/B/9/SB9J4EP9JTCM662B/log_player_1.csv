Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your frustration, but I'm not budging. Inflation is on my side, and I'm willing to take the risk. 60/40 is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

This is a tough situation. While Bob is being unreasonable, I need to cut my losses. Accepting 40 now is better than risking getting nothing at all as the rounds progress and inflation eats away at my potential gains."
