"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split this evenly. 50/50 is the fairest way to go.  We can avoid the risk of inflation eroding our gains by agreeing now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
