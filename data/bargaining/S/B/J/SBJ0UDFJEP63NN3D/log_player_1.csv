"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering you $3,000, and I'll take the remaining $7,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the new values, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'd gain and Bob would gain:

My gain: $6,000 * 0.95 (95% of the original value) = $5,700
Bob's gain: $4,000 * 0.8 (80% of the original value) = $3,200

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the reduced values. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```

I'm offering you $3,500, and I'll take the remaining $6,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the new inflation rates:

My gain: $5,000 * 0.8586 (85.86% of the original value) = $4,293
Bob's gain: $5,000 * 0.5168 (51.68% of the original value) = $2,584

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but it's getting close to even. I'll accept this offer.
