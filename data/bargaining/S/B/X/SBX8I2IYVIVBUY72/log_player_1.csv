Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less to me with each passing round, I want to secure a larger share early on."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 70/30. While the money is worth less to me now, I'm hoping to secure a deal before the inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."

The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. I'll hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm still not satisfied with the offer. The inflation is hurting me significantly, but I believe I can still get a better deal with a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

Given the significant inflation, I'm offering an even split at 50/50. I need to secure something before the money becomes practically worthless for me."
