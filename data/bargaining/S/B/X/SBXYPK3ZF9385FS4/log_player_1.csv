"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be fair"". This way, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to share the money, but I'm also making it clear that I want a slightly larger share. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split. This offer won't be as good in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 5% less in this round, Bob's offer of 45 is actually equivalent to 0.95 * 45 = 42.75 in the first round. Considering this, and the fact that Bob's message implies that the offer won't be as good in the next round, I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less in each round, and this is the third round, the money is now worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of its original value for me. For Bob, the money is worth 20% less in each round, so it's now worth 0.8^2 = 0.64 of its original value.\n\nConsidering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor, which is slightly more generous than my first offer, considering the inflation. My message will be ""Let's find a middle ground"".\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob reacts to this offer!"
