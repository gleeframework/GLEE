"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we both have an equal chance of winning in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is a good outcome considering the inflation factor. It's better than risking further loss in the next round."
