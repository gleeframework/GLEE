"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering I'll be the one making the next offer if you reject this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer.

Since I'm worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking. I'll accept the offer if I can get at least 52.5 (which is 5% less than my initial 60).

In this case, Bob's offer is 45 for me, which is 5% less than my initial 60. It's a bit lower than my target, but I think it's still a decent offer. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
