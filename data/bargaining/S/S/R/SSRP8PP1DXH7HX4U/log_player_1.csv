Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle and split it 50/50, let's end this and avoid further losses to inflation 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers with inflation rapidly decreasing the value of the money for Bob.  It's in my best interest to take the 50/50 split and avoid the risk of losing even more money in future rounds."
