Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.  I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  This seems like a fair compromise.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
