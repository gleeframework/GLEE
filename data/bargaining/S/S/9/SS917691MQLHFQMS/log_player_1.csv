Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor. This gives me a significant advantage, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point given the inflation rates. We'll see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 50/50 split isn't as favorable as my initial offer, it's still a good outcome for me, especially considering the inflation rates. The money I gain is worth less than in the first round, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round. It's better to take the sure thing now."
