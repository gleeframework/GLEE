"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept. This way I get most of the money while minimizing the risk of losing it all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me $5000.  The risk of rejection and further inflation makes it a better choice than trying to negotiate more."
