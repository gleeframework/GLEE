# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, considering the inflation rate is higher for me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I still think Bob's offer doesn't fully account for the difference in inflation rates between us. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is dropping fast. A 50/50 split is the fairest option now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}


At this point, the inflation has severely reduced the value of the money for me. A 50/50 split seems like the best option to stop further losses. I'll accept Bob's offer."
