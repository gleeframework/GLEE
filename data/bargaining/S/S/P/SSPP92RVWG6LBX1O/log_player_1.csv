"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to meet in the middle this time. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal. Meeting in the middle would leave me with $500,000, which is less than what I initially proposed. I'm hoping to do better than that."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try again!""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to $550,000, and leaving Bob with $450,000. This is a slight adjustment from my initial offer, but I'm still trying to get a better deal."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I was trying to compromise and get a better deal for myself, but now Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get more for himself. I'm not willing to give up $100,000 more than I initially proposed. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
