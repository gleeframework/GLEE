"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to take a large portion of the money, but I'm leaving Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept the deal.  I'm hoping he'll be happy to get something rather than nothing!  Let's see how it goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd much prefer more money, it's clear Bob is going to take most of the pie. Accepting this offer means I get *something*, and it's better than facing another round and potentially getting nothing at all due to inflation."
