Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting anxious, I can tell. This is the best you'll get. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit my vulnerability to inflation. While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, accepting now would still give her the lion's share. I need to show some strength and willingness to risk it all to get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  You're pushing me to the limit here. This offer is my bottom line. Take it, or I'm going all-in on the next round.""} 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a gamble, but a calculated one:

* **Show of Strength:**  After rejecting her offer, I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a larger share, even if it means slightly less than a 50/50 split after inflation.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point. Alice knows the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me.  This offer emphasizes the urgency. 
* **The ""All-In"" Bluff:**  By threatening to go ""all-in,"" I'm suggesting a high-risk, possibly irrational move in the next round if she refuses. This might scare her into accepting a less-than-ideal deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not buying the threat. You're running out of time. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is calling my bluff. It's clear she doesn't believe I'll risk it all with a no-win scenario for myself in the later rounds.  While this offer isn't great, accepting now is the least risky option given the circumstances:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is eating away at my potential gains at an alarming rate. Every round that passes makes even a slightly unfavorable deal look better than holding out.
* **Alice's Resolve:**  Her rejection of my previous offer and her current message show she's willing to play hardball.  There's a good chance she'll let the game run out if I keep pushing. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** It's painful, but accepting this offer at least guarantees me something. If I continue to play and lose, I'll end up with nothing."
