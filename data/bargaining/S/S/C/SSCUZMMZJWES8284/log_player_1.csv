I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept. I figure a 90/10 split is fair, as I'm taking the risk of making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a lot fairer than my first one, but I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor this time.  Since we're both losing money due to inflation, I think this is a reasonable compromise.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair. Even though I'm losing money due to inflation,  I'm not going to accept this. I'm still hoping for a better deal, and I'm willing to risk it for a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split this time.  We're both losing money due to inflation, and I think it's time to compromise. This is a fair offer, and I hope Bob will finally see it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting even worse.  Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm not going to give in to this.  I'm going to keep fighting for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm offering a 40/60 split this time. Even though inflation is hurting me, I'm willing to give Bob a little more to try and secure a deal. It's getting really risky to keep rejecting offers, but I'm still hopeful we can come to an agreement."
