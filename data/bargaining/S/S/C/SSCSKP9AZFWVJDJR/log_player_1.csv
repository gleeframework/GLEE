"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, it's a good starting point, but I'm not giving away 50% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about the 400k offer, but I don't want to give up too much either. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to negotiate further in the next round.
