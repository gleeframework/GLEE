"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial 100$, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the inflation we're both facing.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factored in, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
