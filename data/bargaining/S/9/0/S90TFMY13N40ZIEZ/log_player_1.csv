  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I'll have to be careful with Bob's offer.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I want to take a 60/40 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to get a better deal."

Hmm... I'm not sure if I want to take a 45/55 split, considering the money is worth less now. I'll think about it for a moment...

Hmm... I'm not sure if I want to take a 30/70 split, considering the money is worth significantly less now. But I have to admit, this is a pretty good offer from Bob, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the deal. It's not ideal, but it's better than going to another round and risking getting an even worse deal."
