"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start with!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's still too skewed in his favor. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer doesn't quite get me there. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a more substantial offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slightly larger share. Can you meet me in the middle?""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can finally come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share for taking the risk of waiting! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While I appreciate his willingness to give me a bit more, I still don't think the split is fair. I'm starting to feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $4,000 when I was hoping for more. I think I need to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I think we're getting close, but I still want to try to get a slightly better deal. Let's try to meet in the middle again, but this time I'll give you a slightly better offer.""}

I'm proposing another split, this time with me getting $5,000 and Bob getting $5,000. I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, hoping to get a better deal while still being reasonable."
