Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it closer to the middle, but I'm willing to give you a little extra since you lose more value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
