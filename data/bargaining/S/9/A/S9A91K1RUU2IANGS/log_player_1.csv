"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 60/40""}

I'm proposing that I receive 600,000 and Bob receives 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and propose a new one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 split""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the initial 60/40 split, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer again, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as affected by the inflation.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposal. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will finally agree to a reasonable split.
