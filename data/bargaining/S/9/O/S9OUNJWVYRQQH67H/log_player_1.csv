"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer seems fair to me. I'm giving Bob a smaller share, but since he's the one who gets to decide if they want to accept this, I think it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share,  I think it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  Bob has a higher discount rate on the money, so waiting longer will only hurt me in the long run."
