"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly, I'll take the lion's share since I'm making the first offer, but you still get a decent chunk. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a very lopsided offer. While the money is worth the same for both of us in this round, the terms are unfair.  I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. A 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation advantage you'll have in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's cut the losses and split this evenly. If we keep going, the inflation is going to hurt us both. This is the fairest option for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

An even split is a fair outcome considering the inflation effects. It's in both of our best interests to end the game here."
