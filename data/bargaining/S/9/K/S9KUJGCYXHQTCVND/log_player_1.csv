"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as it offers Bob a decent share while still leaving me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I offer a 60/40 split, hoping to find a middle ground.  This is still a significant gain for Bob, but also allows me to secure a larger share while the money is still relatively valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the value of the money has dropped considerably and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer. Accepting this deal is the most reasonable way to secure a sizable gain in this game."
