"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally. It's fair and efficient. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's fair, I know I can potentially get more if I play strategically and try to push for a slightly larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than an even split. I'm offering you a bit less, but I'm also willing to take a slight risk and let you make the next offer if you don't agree.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe in fairness. Let's adjust our shares slightly. This way, we both get more than half, promoting mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is worse for me than the previous round, even with the inflation factor.  While the message suggests fairness, the offer is skewed in her favor. I'm going to reject and try to push for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a more balanced split is possible. Let's meet in the middle. This offer gives you a significant share, and I'm confident we can both come out ahead.""}
