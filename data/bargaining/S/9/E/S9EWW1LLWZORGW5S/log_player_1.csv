Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  I figure this gives Bob a decent starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I'll get a better deal if I reject. With inflation, the money will be worth less in the next round.  It's better to take what I can get now."
