"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, see how you like it.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90$ and Bob 10$. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's start with a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the original $100, the effective amount is now $80 for me and $90 for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You were close, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're increasing the gap, I'll try to bridge it. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be careful with my decisions. Since the money is worth less for me and more for Bob, I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 45$ and call it a day!"
