"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but I'm giving you a chance to get something. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. While 10 dollars is better than nothing, Alice's offer heavily favors her.  The inflation rate works strongly in my favor as the game goes on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This offer reflects the time pressure we both face.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough considering the rapidly increasing inflation she faces. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. This offer is more than generous considering the rapid devaluation of your share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure, Bob, but I need a better deal to justify accepting. This offer is a step in the right direction, let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 65 
# Alice gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is feeling the heat, but I can get a better deal. While 65 dollars is tempting, holding out for one more round might be enough to tip the scales significantly in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. My offer reflects the urgency of the situation. You're losing value fast.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is the most I can offer given the current situation, but it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 75 
# Alice gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is it! Alice is finally feeling the full effects of the inflation. Holding out any longer might make her desperate enough to accept an even smaller share, but there is no guarantee. It's too risky to let this offer slip away. 75 dollars is a good deal at this point."
