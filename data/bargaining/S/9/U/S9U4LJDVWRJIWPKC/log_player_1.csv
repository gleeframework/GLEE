Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it down the middle, huh? That's a pretty straightforward offer.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're close, Bob, but I think I deserve a bit more. Meet me in the middle, and I'll consider it.""

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at Bob's share, I'll take a closer look at his offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not convinced that I should settle for $6,000. I'll keep pushing for a better deal!"

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really eating away at Bob's share! With that in mind, I'll take a closer look at his offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for him. It's not the deal I wanted, but it's better than walking away with nothing!"
