"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which means I'll get $80 and Bob will get $20. I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I think this is a fair starting point."
