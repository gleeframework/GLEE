60.0,40.0,"Let's split the money 60/40. This gives us a good head start, and it's better to secure a deal early on before inflation eats away at the value.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Let's split it 55/45. Since the money loses value over time, and it loses more value for you, I think this is a fair offer considering we both want to walk away with something.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. You rejected my previous offer, and now the value has decreased for both of us. I'm willing to compromise with a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I'm willing to take a bit more. 58/42 is still a relatively fair split, and we should settle before the value drops even further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
53.0,47.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement. I'm adjusting my offer to 53/47.  This acknowledges the inflation while still offering you a reasonable share. Let's close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"We're running out of time, and the value is dropping fast. I'll take 60, and you get 40. This is as fair as it gets, considering the circumstances.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money because of our stubbornness. Let's split it 50/50 right now and get out of here before we're both left with nothing.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,accept
