Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be reasonable here, Bob.  Inflation is hurting us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the remaining money, and it gives us both something to work with.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
