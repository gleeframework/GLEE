"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm curious to see what Bob will propose in response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation we need to account for.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is now worth 80% of 80%, which is 64.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I think it's a reasonable compromise given the circumstances. I accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
