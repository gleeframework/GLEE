"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering you $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my gain of $5,000 in this round is equivalent to $4,000 in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is equivalent to $4,500 or $4,500 * 0.9 = $4,050 in the first round, so I'll assume the worst-case scenario.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
