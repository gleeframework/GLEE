55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a simple fair split. I propose we take $55 and you get $45.  It's important to divide this quickly before inflation eats into it!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Hey Alice, I think I deserve a bit more. How about 60 for me and 40 for you?",Bob,2,
,,"Come on Bob, let's be reasonable.  That's not much different than my offer, and inflation is only going to hurt us both!",Alice,2,reject
52.0,48.0,"Okay Bob, let's try this again.  I'll come down a little to $52, and you take $48.  We need to agree soon!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, I'm willing to compromise. How about 58 for me and 42 for you? Inflation is eating into our money, so let's settle this soon!",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Your offer barely budged while inflation keeps eating away at our potential gains. Let's be sensible and split this fairly!",Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  We're losing money with every wasted round! Let's just split it evenly at $50 each and call it a day.",Alice,5,
