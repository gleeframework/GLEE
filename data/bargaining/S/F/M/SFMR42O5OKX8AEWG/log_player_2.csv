"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Time is running out, and this ensures we both benefit significantly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn again. I've adjusted my offer slightly, considering the time pressure.  Let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has improved slightly, it's crucial to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for her.  It's highly likely she'll be willing to make a much better offer in the next round as the deadline approaches."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking! I'm offering you a sizeable 350,000. Take it before inflation eats away at its value even further.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This round, I'm increasing my demand slightly to put pressure on Alice.  The significant drop in value for both of us, but particularly for her, makes this a risky move on her part to continue delaying. This offer gives her a reasonable, but decreasing, amount while securing a larger share for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a serious offer. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the heat of inflation, even though she's still aiming for a slightly larger share. Her willingness to take a hit shows she's getting desperate.  We're past the halfway point, and with each round, the money loses value drastically, especially for Alice.  I'm confident I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. 700,000 for me. You're losing ground fast due to inflation.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a power play. I'm significantly increasing my demand, knowing Alice is in a tight spot.  The message is framed as an ultimatum, emphasizing the shrinking value of the money, especially for her. This strong-arming tactic might push her to accept to avoid walking away with even less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money. This offer is a compromise, and it's the last one I can make that makes sense for me given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but with time running out, it's the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is plummeting. Waiting any longer significantly risks walking away with nothing. 
* **Alice's Position:**  Her offer is her best yet and suggests she might be at her limit. Rejecting it could mean she's willing to let the deal fall apart.
* **Current Offer:** While not ideal, 550,000 is still a substantial amount. It's better to secure this now than gamble on a better offer in the few remaining rounds and potentially end up with zero."
