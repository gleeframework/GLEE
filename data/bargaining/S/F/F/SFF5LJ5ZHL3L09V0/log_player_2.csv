Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this one.  You're losing value far quicker than I am. A 70/30 split is the best you'll get at this point. Don't be stubborn. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that I am losing value faster, but her offer is getting worse for me! Holding out a bit longer is risky, but I need to show I'm serious about getting a fair share. Accepting a 30/70 split sets a terrible precedent for future negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to be flexible, but 70/30 is simply unacceptable.  Meet me in the middle at 45/55, or this deal is off.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Frustration:** Alice needs to understand that her increasingly lopsided offers are not conducive to a deal.  
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 45/55 shows I'm willing to move from a 50/50 split, but not drastically. 
* **Deadline Pressure:** By stating ""this deal is off"", I'm increasing the pressure.  Time is running out."
