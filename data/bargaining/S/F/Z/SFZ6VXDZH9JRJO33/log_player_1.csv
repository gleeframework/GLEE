"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A more balanced split, considering the initial imbalance 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my potential gain of $300,000 is worth 90% of the original value, so it's actually $270,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a more balanced split than my initial offer. I'll accept it.
