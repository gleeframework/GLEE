"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a split of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  It's a large share for me, but I want to see if he'll accept it right away or try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's less than my initial proposal, taking 5,000 is better than losing everything due to inflation. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk it further."
