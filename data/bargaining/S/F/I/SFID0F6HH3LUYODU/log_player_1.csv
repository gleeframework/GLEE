"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I need to adjust my perception of the offer. I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain in this round:

$50 * 0.9 = $45

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is a bit better than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You seemed willing to split it evenly last round, but I want a bit more this time""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, keeping $60 for myself, and framing it as a slight increase from the even split he proposed earlier."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should compromise. Let's split it 60/40. This will allow us both to get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me, I need to adjust my perception of the offer. I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain in this round:

$40 * 0.7279 = $29.16

Considering the inflation, this offer is actually a good deal for me. I think I can do better than this, but it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
