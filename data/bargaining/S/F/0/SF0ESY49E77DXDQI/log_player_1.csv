"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me getting the bigger share this time. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks a 60/40 split is fair, but this time he wants the bigger share!

Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in Round 3.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! 55/45 split is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving me $5,500 and Bob $4,500."
