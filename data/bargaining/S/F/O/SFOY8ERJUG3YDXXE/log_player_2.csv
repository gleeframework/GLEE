Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we divide the money 5200 for me and 4800 for you. This maintains a reasonable difference while accounting for the decreasing value of money in future rounds.
