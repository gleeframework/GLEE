Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the money will be worth less in the next round.  Let's go for 6000/4000. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
