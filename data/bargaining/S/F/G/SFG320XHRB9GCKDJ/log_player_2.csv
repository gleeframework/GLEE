"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bigger cut to make it worthwhile for me. How about this?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value quickly for both of us. It's in our best interest to settle this quickly.
* **Prioritizing My Gain:** I need to aim higher than Alice's initial offer to account for the inflation hitting me harder. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  While I'm pushing for more, I'm also trying to frame it as a fair counter-offer rather than a harsh rejection of her initial proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Hurting:** Another round means even less money for both of us. 
* **Alice is Negotiating:** Her offer is getting closer to a more even split. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of losing even more value to inflation."
