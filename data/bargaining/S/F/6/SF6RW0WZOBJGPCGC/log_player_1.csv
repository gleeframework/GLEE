"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, let's try for more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75-25 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. It's time for me to make a new offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can both walk away happy""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, trying to find a compromise that's closer to a fair share for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too soft, let's get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. But I still think I can do better than a 50-50 split.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation. It's time for me to make another offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal, Bob! Let's find a sweet spot""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, while still being reasonable. The money is worth a lot less now, so I'm aiming for a 52-48 split."
