"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is offering a 50-50 split now!

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I'd rather not risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns due to inflation!"
