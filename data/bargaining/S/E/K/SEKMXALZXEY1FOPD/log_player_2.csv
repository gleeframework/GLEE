Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for me. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
