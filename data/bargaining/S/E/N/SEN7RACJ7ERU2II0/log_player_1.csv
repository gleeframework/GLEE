I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round.  I want to see if Bob is willing to take a small share right away, or if he'll play it safe and try to negotiate a better deal later on.  It's important to remember the inflation factor, so getting a good chunk of the money early is crucial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is trying to flip the script! It's clear he's aiming for a much bigger share. While it's tempting to accept his offer considering the inflation, I'm going to reject it and see if I can negotiate something better in the next round. I'm banking on the fact that he might be willing to compromise a bit to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway. I'm reducing my offer from the first round, but still proposing a significant share for myself. I hope this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to be taken advantage of.  The inflation is a major factor here, so I need to make sure I get a decent amount while there's still some value left."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

Bob is really pushing his luck! I'm definitely not going to accept this offer.  I'm losing value rapidly due to inflation, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to strike a balance between my need for a decent share and the risk of getting nothing at all."

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a 50/50 split this round. The inflation is really starting to hurt, so I need to secure a reasonable amount.  A 50/50 split is fair and might be something Bob will be willing to accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing. It's a gamble, but I believe it's a good move at this point."
