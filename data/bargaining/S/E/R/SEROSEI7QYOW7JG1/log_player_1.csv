"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I would receive $60 and Bob would receive $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice gain: 40 = 40 x (1 - 0.05) = 38
Bob gain: 60 = 60 x (1 - 0.2) = 48

So, in reality, I would get $38 and Bob would get $48.

Considering this, I'll make a decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both receive equal amounts."
