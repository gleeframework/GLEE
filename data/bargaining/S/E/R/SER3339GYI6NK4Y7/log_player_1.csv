"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is going for a 50/50 split! Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to weigh the value of the offer. However, I'm not sure if Bob is considering the inflation factor.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob! But I think I can do better. Let's see what I can propose.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time. Let's see if you'll accept!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the remaining value after the first two rounds of inflation."
