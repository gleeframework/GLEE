Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, I'm not happy to settle for an even split when inflation is working against me. I need to push for a larger share in the earlier rounds to make up for this disadvantage."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a balance between fairness and acknowledging the inflation factor. This offer gives you a slight edge while still being a good deal for me. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Bob is finally acknowledging the inflation, but his offer is still not advantageous enough. I need to hold out for a better deal.  While time is ticking, settling for a suboptimal agreement will hurt me more in the long run."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but time is also a factor now. I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for me to reflect the increasing impact of inflation. This ensures we both walk away with a reasonable share.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  I'm offering a deal that acknowledges the time pressure and inflation impact, but it's also fair to both of us.  We both win if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is now getting close to my initial proposal.  With six rounds gone, the inflation is becoming more significant. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a reasonable amount, even if it's slightly less than I aimed for initially.  The risk of continuing and getting a worse offer is now too high."
