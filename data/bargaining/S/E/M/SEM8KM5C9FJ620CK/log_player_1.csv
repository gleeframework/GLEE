"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, considering my loss due to inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for Bob, justifying the split with the argument that she is losing value each round due to inflation. This initial offer aims to find a balance, considering the impact of inflation on Alice's share. The message is brief and to the point, emphasizing the fairness of the division under the given circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I understand your concerns about inflation, but my offer is more balanced. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice rejects Bob's offer, which, despite acknowledging her concerns about inflation, does not adequately compensate for the loss in value she incurs with each passing round. By rejecting, Alice aims to push for a more favorable division in the next round, hoping that her next proposal will better account for the diminishing value of her potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing loss due to inflation, I've adjusted my offer. This is as fair as it gets.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice revises her offer, taking into account the additional loss in value from the second round's inflation. She proposes to take $580,000, slightly less than her initial offer but still more than Bob's previous suggestion, aiming to strike a balance that acknowledges her increasing loss while remaining palatable to Bob. The message emphasizes the fairness of this revised offer under the current circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  We both lose if this drags on.  I'm making a final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice accepts Bob's offer, recognizing that further rounds will only continue to erode the value of her potential gain due to inflation, while Bob's share remains unaffected. Bob's message frames this as a final offer, suggesting that negotiations are unlikely to improve the terms for Alice. By accepting, Alice secures a share of $530,000, which, although less than her initial proposals, is preferable to the diminishing returns from continued negotiation."
