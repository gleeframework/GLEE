"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly less generous offer, let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll take the inflation into account for Bob's gain. 

If Bob's gain is 6000 in this round, it's equivalent to 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67 in the first round. 

I'll reject the offer since I can do better than 4000.

  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the equivalent value of Bob's gain in the first round. 

If Bob's gain is 7000 in this round, it's equivalent to 7000 / 0.727 = 9627.82 in the first round.

I'll reject the offer since I can do better than 3000.

If Bob's gain is 8000 in this round, it's equivalent to 8000 / 0.5945 = 13494.93 in the first round.
