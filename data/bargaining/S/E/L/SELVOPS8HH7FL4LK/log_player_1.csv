"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm proposing a split of $90 for me and $10 for Bob.  Since I'm the first to propose, I want to maximize my share while still making it somewhat appealing to Bob.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a higher amount,  I'm accepting this offer.  In the next round, I'd be proposing again and my gains would be worth even less due to inflation.  It's better to secure at least something now."
