{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but it's my turn now.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Think carefully, the value decreases for you with each round.""}

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, it's getting ridiculous. Let's be fair and split it 50/50.  Another round, and the money will be worth even less for me.

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
