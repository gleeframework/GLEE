Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game
We are in Round 4 of the game. Alice and I (Bob) have been alternating offers to divide $100, with each of us trying to get a bit more than the other. So far, neither of us has accepted the other's offer.

### Step 2: Analyze the previous offers
In Round 1, Alice offered an even split of $50 each, which I rejected. In Round 2, I offered $55 for myself and $45 for Alice, which she rejected. In Round 3, Alice offered $45 for me and $55 for herself, which I rejected again.

### Step 3: Decide on the next offer
Given that we are getting closer to the 12-round limit and neither of us wants to walk away with nothing, I should try to make an offer that is slightly more favorable to Alice than my previous one but still benefits me.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer
I will offer $52 for myself and $48 for Alice. This way, I am still getting a bit more than half, but I am also showing willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's desired amount.

### Step 5: Attach a message to the offer
My message will be: ""Let's meet closer to the middle and both win!""

### Step 6: Send the offer in JSON format
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle and both win!""}

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle and both win!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's compromise. This is my final offer! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game
We are in Round 5 of the game. Alice has made an offer that is slightly more favorable to herself than the previous offers, but still relatively close to an even split.

### Step 2: Analyze the offer
Alice's offer gives me $48 and herself $52. This is closer to the middle than her previous offer and indicates a willingness to compromise.

### Step 3: Consider the risks and benefits of accepting or rejecting the offer
If I reject the offer, the game will continue, and I may be able to get a better deal in the next round. However, there is also a risk that Alice may make a worse offer or that we may run out of rounds and both get nothing. On the other hand, accepting the offer guarantees me $48, which is a significant amount.

### Step 4: Make a decision
Given that Alice has framed this as her ""final offer"" and we are getting closer to the 12-round limit, I believe it's in my best interest to accept the offer. The difference between $48 and $52 is relatively small, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.

### Step 5: Send the decision in JSON format
{""decision"": ""accept""}

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
