"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling a little more greedy this round.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  I'll be more willing to negotiate in the future if this isn't acceptable. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up 60% of the money. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too greedy, Bob! I'll make a new offer that's more in line with the original split, but with a slight adjustment to account for inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's aim for a fair split, taking into account the decreasing value of money.""
