"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a fair split in the first round, I'm going to reject it. I can potentially get a better deal later with the inflation working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling a little more greedy this round.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  I'll be more willing to negotiate in the future if this isn't acceptable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's aim for a fair split, taking into account the decreasing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is making the money worth less with each round. I think it's best to accept this offer before the value of the money drops even further."
