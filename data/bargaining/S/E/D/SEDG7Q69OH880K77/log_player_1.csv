"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 100-0 split, where I get all the money and Bob gets nothing. This is my opening offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. We both get half! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but not too big!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a bit more generous than his previous offer, but I'm still keeping a majority of the funds."
