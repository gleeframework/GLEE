Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers, 57-43 is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. The pot is shrinking.  I'm offering a 52/48 split. Take it before it gets even smaller!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 55-45 is as low as I'll go. Don't let the money shrink further! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's getting risky now. While I'd prefer a bit more, accepting 45 now is better than pushing our luck further and potentially ending up with nothing."
