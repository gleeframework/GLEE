"Round 1
Alice's offer:

This is a ridiculous offer.  It's highly unlikely that Alice will keep accepting these kinds of offers, and I can do much better by making my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a very generous offer for the first round, and it gives Alice a significant amount to consider.  I'm hoping she'll accept and we can both walk away with a sizable chunk of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice has flipped the script and is now offering a 90/10 split in her favor.  While the inflation has impacted my potential earnings, accepting this offer still means walking away with a substantial amount of money.  It's better than risking getting nothing if we keep playing and the inflation continues to bite."
