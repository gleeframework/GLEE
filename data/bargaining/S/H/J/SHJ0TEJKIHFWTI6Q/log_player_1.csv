"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slightly bigger share since I'm the one making the proposal.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is to split it evenly, I'll have to consider the current value of the money. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll still get $6,000. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so he'll only get $4,000 in real terms.

Considering the current value of the money, I think I'm getting a slightly better deal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
