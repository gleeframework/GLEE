"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better, let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in Round 2, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $40, which is 40% of the original $100. That's a good offer, considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
