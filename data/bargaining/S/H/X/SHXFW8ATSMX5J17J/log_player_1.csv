"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I deserve to get 70% of the money, especially since Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that he's making the offer this round. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to take its toll! The money is worth 10% less now.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one who rejected your previous offer. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split this time, but I'm still not giving in to Bob's demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! The money is worth less and less each round.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll consider it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer, but I'm not happy about it. I'm hoping Bob will make a better offer in the next round."
