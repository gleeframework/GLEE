"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 7000 * 0.95 = 6650
Bob gain: 3000 * 0.95 = 2850

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
