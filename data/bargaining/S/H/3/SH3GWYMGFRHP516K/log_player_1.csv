"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see how it goes from here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 40 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 60 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not give up 20% of the remaining money so quickly. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 80% of its original value now, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a better split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45, which is a bit less than his previous offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. With the money now worth 51.2% of its original value, I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer. However, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk going home with nothing.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in future rounds.
