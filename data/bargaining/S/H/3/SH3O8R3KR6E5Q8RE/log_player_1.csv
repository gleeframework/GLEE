"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need more than 45% to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, the $4000 offered by Bob is equivalent to $3600 in the first round. I initially asked for $5500, so this offer is still lower than what I was hoping for. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3! I'll make a new offer to Bob.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""50/50 split, considering the inflation, this is a fair deal.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision and message."
