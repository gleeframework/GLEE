"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bit more this round, but I'm still considering your position. Let's see how this plays out. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm trying to meet Bob somewhere in the middle while still highlighting the disadvantage he faces with inflation. Hopefully, he accepts this time."
