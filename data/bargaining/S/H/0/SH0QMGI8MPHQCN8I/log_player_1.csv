Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more fair split is 60/40. We both get a good share, and it avoids the risk of inflation hurting your side too much. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
