"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but still leave you with a decent amount.""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 20:80 split, and I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less now. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a significant portion for myself."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 35:65 split, and I think Bob is still trying to take advantage of the situation. Considering the inflation, I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway and split it 50/50. Let's end this and move on.""}

I'm trying to find a fair and equal split, considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money. I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise at this point."
