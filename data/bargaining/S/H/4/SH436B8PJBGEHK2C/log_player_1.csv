"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best deal for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```

Round 3
