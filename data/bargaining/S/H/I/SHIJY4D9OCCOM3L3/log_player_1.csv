"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. It's a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

I'll think carefully... Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a larger share to make up for the loss. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split, but still aiming to get a larger share to account for the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

I'll think carefully... With the money being worth even less, I'll aim to get a larger share to make up for the loss. However, this offer is closer to a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure if I should push for more. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing an even more skewed split, with me getting 80% of the remaining money. I'm trying to maximize my share while there's still value left!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll think carefully... With the money being worth less and less, I'll aim to get a larger share to make up for the loss. However, Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure if I should push for more. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
