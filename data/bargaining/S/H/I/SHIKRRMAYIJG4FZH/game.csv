600000.0,400000.0,I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while also considering the risk of inflation over subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the risk of inflation and the fact that I'm taking a bigger risk by rejecting your initial offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I propose an equal division of the money, which might not maximize my potential gain but aims to maintain fairness and avoid unnecessary risks. I hope this aligns with your preferences and strategy.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"I'm starting to take a more aggressive approach, considering the decreasing value of the money. I think this is my best chance to maximize my gain before the money becomes worthless.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Given the current situation, I propose a significant disparity in our shares, with the intention of maximizing my gains before the money loses its value further. I believe this is a strategic move given the aggressive stance taken by Bob in previous rounds.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"I'm still looking to maximize my gain, but I'm also aware that Alice is taking a risk by offering such a small share. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Considering the inflation rate and the trend of increasing disparity in offers, I propose a significant increase in my share. This reflects the diminishing value of the money and aims to secure a substantial gain for myself before the end of the game.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I'm starting to realize that Alice is not willing to meet me in the middle. I'm taking a risk by making this offer, but I think it's my best chance to get a decent share of the money before it's too late.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Given the ongoing inflation and the pattern of increasingly lopsided offers, I propose a more balanced distribution. This aims to ensure a fair share for both parties while considering the diminishing value of the money.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'm getting desperate, and I think I need to take a bigger risk to get a decent share. This offer is my last chance to get a substantial amount before the money becomes almost worthless.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"With each passing round, the stakes become higher due to inflation. I propose a slightly more equitable split, aiming to balance the risk and reward for both parties. This could potentially lead to a more amicable resolution.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I'm not going to get a better deal than this. I'm willing to split it 50/50, hoping that Alice will see the value in not risking everything for a slightly larger share at this point.",Bob,12,
