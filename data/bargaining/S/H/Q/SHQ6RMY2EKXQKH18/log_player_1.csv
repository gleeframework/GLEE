"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair and simple start!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I'm hoping to get a better deal later on. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to accept a 4:1 ratio in favor of Bob. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a bit more, but I still think we can do better than this. Let's try to find a middle ground!""
}

I'm proposing a 2:3 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent chunk of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle and find a more balanced solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll give you a small chance to get something, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is really trying to squeeze me out! I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll think carefully before making a decision. Here's my response:

{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to accept a 9:1 ratio in favor of Bob. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is getting too extreme. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 300000,

""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to get squeezed out completely. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us!""
}

I'm proposing a 3:7 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous offers. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle and find a more balanced solution."
