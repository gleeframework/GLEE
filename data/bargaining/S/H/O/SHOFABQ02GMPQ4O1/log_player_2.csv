"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share this round, but we can work something out in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept something, it's best to see what Alice will offer in the next round when she's the one proposing.  The wording suggests she might be more willing to negotiate in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair starting point.  Let's work together to get a deal that's good for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time. I'm willing to be more flexible in the future if you are. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering we are both losing value due to inflation. It's also a good sign that she is willing to be more flexible in the future.  This is a good opportunity to secure a decent outcome."
