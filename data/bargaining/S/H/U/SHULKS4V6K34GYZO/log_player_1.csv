"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start, and see if we can improve from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with 60-40, I'll meet you in the middle with 80-20. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me halfway!

I'm not sure if I want to give up 40 dollars, but 20 is a decent compromise. I'll think about it for a moment...

  ""decision"": ""accept""
