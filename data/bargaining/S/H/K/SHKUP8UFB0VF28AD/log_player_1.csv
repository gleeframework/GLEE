"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'll offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent share while allowing me to keep the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Although I'm getting less than I initially wanted,  it's still better than the 5% loss from inflation.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
