"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000. It's in our best interest to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early in the game to settle for such a lopsided deal. I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fair offer, Alice. However, I think it's more equitable to split the money evenly. Let's aim for a 50/50 split this round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value fast, especially for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I understand that time is running out, but I'm still not comfortable with this offer. It's still not a fair split, and I'm willing to see how the next rounds play out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but I also need to make sure I get a decent share of the money.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a little more than 4500. Let's split it 55/45 this round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're approaching the halfway point and this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is still a compromise, and with the inflation rate, we're both losing out the longer this goes on. Do you really want to risk getting nothing? 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While I appreciate the sense of urgency, Alice, I'm not willing to accept an offer that's still significantly skewed in your favor.  We both need to find a more balanced solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're losing money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable and split the remaining amount equally. This is the fairest and most logical way to proceed.""}
