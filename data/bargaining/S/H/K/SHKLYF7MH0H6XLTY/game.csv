4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate your fair offer, Alice. However, I think it's more equitable to split the money evenly. Let's aim for a 50/50 split this round.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value fast, especially for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's settle this now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but I also need to make sure I get a decent share of the money.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a little more than 4500. Let's split it 55/45 this round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Bob, we're approaching the halfway point and this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is still a compromise, and with the inflation rate, we're both losing out the longer this goes on. Do you really want to risk getting nothing?",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, we're losing money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable and split the remaining amount equally. This is the fairest and most logical way to proceed.",Bob,6,
