"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself as the first proposer. This strategy aims to secure a significant portion of the money while leaving room for potential negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the later rounds. The inflation rate is significant, and it's likely that Bob will offer even less in the future."
