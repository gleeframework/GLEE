"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be willing to offer me more to avoid losing value.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to Round 2. I'm excited to see Alice's next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly in my favor, considering Alice's decreasing valuation of the money.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering your loss, I think 55-45 is more suitable.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice and let me know her response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still open to a 50-50 split.  Inflation is hitting us both, and I think it's best to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again, as the conditions haven't changed in my favor, and I believe Alice may be willing to offer more in the next round due to the increasing effect of inflation on her gains.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to Round 4. I'm looking forward to Alice's next proposal or making another counteroffer!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","With Alice's decreasing valuation of the money, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer in my favor, while still being reasonable and leaving room for negotiation.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is affecting you more, so I think 58-42 is a fair adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice and let me know her response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is impacting me more, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 45-55 to avoid further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer since it's the first time Alice has made a concession in my favor, and further rounds may lead to increased uncertainty and the risk of getting nothing. Given the current offer aligns with my previous counteroffer, I believe it's a reasonable compromise.\n\n###\n\nPlease conclude the game as I've accepted Alice's offer in Round 5."
