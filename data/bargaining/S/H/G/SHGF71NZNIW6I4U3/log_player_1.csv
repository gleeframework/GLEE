"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (90$) while still giving Bob a small amount (10$). I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as he gets something and avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more than 50%, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the future. This way, I'm guaranteed to get something."
