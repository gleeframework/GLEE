"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll accept this offer to get a guaranteed 50$.
