"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  No need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's equivalent to $45.

I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the inflation. However, Bob's offer is still a fair one, and I don't want to be too greedy.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round, due to two rounds of inflation (10% and 10%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100, and Bob gets 45%."
