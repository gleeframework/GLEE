Let's see what we can get with a more aggressive proposal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still not happy with this split. I'm hoping Alice will come around to a fairer offer in the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Middle ground isn't exactly fair considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is being unreasonable with her offers. I'm hoping we can reach a compromise before the inflation gets even worse."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up a little, but we need to find a solution before inflation eats away at our gains. Let's split it 55/45.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side, let's be realistic about the value of money here 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This offer is still not fair, and I'm concerned that if I accept it, Alice will continue to exploit the inflation. I'm going to try one more time to propose a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""We're running out of time, and inflation is only going to hurt us both more. Let's find a middle ground - 5200 for me, 4800 for you.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still have the upper hand 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While it's painful to see Alice take the majority, with inflation I'm worried that rejecting this offer will result in a worse outcome in the next round. Accepting will at least secure some money, even if it's not a perfect outcome."
