Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, Alice. Let's make it fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out, and the value is decreasing. My offer is still generous. Let's close the deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing for both of us, Alice. This offer reflects the time pressure we're both under. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is playing a tough game, but I need to hold my ground a little longer.  The value decrease hurts me more than him, but accepting such a low offer now would leave me with a significantly smaller portion. I'll try to push him a bit further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

It's time to push for a 50/50 split. While it's not ideal with the inflation working against me, it's better than accepting a deal significantly favoring Bob. The strong ""take it or leave it"" message emphasizes the urgency and might make him reconsider his position."
