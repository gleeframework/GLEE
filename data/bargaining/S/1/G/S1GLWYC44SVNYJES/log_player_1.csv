"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy in the first round, now it's my turn to make a more generous offer! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to fall for Bob's ""generous"" offer just yet!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is trying to make a lowball offer to get me to accept, but I'm not going to take the bait. I'll wait for a better offer or make a counteroffer of my own."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""You can do better than that, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but not that much""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more generous than my original offer, but still reflects my initial valuation of the shares. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not getting the better deal, I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me again!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not going to accept an offer that's even worse than the one he made in round 2. I think Bob is trying to wear me down, but I'm not going to give in. I'll keep pushing for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle! I'm willing to compromise and split it 50-50""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a more balanced deal!"
