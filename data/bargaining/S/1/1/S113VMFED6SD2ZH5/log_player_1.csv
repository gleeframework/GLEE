"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20, and I'll take 80. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, I'm offering a relatively fair split, but I'm also keeping a larger portion for myself to start with. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 60, but I think it's a reasonable starting point. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
