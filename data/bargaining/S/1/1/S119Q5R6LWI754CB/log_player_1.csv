"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
``` 

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and take the lion's share.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, but I'm prepared to bargain if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with this offer, but I'm going to reject it. The inflation has hit me hard, and I don't think I can accept this deal. I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to strike a compromise this round. Since Bob was willing to give me a bigger share in the last round, I'm offering him a fair deal that reflects the current value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although inflation has hit me hard, I'm going to accept this offer. Bob's offer is significantly less than my previous offer, but it's still a decent amount of money. I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
