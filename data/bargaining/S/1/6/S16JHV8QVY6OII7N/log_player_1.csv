"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. My message to Bob is a friendly reminder that accepting this offer will end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'll give you a chance to take what you offered me last round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get me to accept the same offer I made in the first round. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept the same terms, especially since the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less now due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better offer than last time.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $520,000 and keeping $480,000 for myself. My message to Bob is a hint that I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to accept a worse deal than last time."
