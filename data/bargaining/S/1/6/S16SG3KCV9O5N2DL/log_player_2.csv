"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's initial offer was 10, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Given the inflation, I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Alice. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 25, ""alice_gain"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Taking into account the inflation, Alice's offer seems more reasonable now. However, I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll try to negotiate further. My current gain of 20 is worth 9.75% less than the initial 10, which is $0.975. I'll try to get closer to that amount. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 20, and considering the inflation, I'll try to increase my share. I'll aim for a gain that's closer to the original 10, taking into account the 9.75% decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 17.5, ""alice_gain"": 82.5}"
