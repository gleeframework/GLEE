"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it 60-40, I'll take the bigger share since I made the first offer 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's too early to accept a 60-40 split. There are many rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a 55-45 split. It's a fair starting point, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit less than before, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to 50/50, I'm still holding out for a more even split. The inflation is starting to hurt, but there are still several rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both lose value with each round, so it's in our best interest to reach an agreement now.""}
