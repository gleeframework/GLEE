Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer. While it's a good starting point, I believe I can get a better deal by proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I propose a split of 6000 for me and 4000 for Alice. This is a fair starting point, and I believe it will be a good compromise."
