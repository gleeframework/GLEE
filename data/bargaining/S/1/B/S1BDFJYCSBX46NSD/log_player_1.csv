"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving Bob with $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.8 = 360,000
Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.8 = 440,000

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a better deal for me in terms of actual value.
