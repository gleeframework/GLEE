"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

After considering the proposal, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 30% in his favor, I'll try to adjust my proposal to make it more favorable to myself. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
