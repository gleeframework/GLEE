"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original 100$, which is 20$. I'll take the remaining 80%. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50$ is now worth 40$ (80% of 50$).

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the fairest way to go, considering the inflation. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it evenly is the best idea, considering the inflation. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of 50$ is now worth 40$. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority of the remaining value. It's a generous offer, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
