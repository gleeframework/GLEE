"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and just split it almost equally""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a slightly unequal split, with me taking $55 and Bob taking $45. I've attached a message suggesting that this is a fair split, in the hopes that Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't have to worry about the value of the money decreasing over time. However, since the money is worth 5% less for Bob each round, he may be motivated to accept a slightly worse deal now rather than risk losing even more value in future rounds. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value of the money decreases for me each round. Let's be fair and switch our gains from the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the value of the money doesn't decrease for me, I don't have an incentive to accept a worse deal than what I initially proposed. In the previous round, I offered Bob $45, and now he's offering me $45, so I don't feel like I'm getting a better deal. Additionally, I know that the value of the money is decreasing for Bob each round, so I may be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'll hold out for a better offer. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""You didn't accept my initial offer, and now the value of the money has decreased for you. I'll give you a bit less this time.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob a slightly worse deal than what I initially proposed. Since the value of the money has decreased by 10% for Bob over the past two rounds (5% each round), I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept a less favorable deal now rather than risk losing even more value in future rounds. I've increased my share to $57 and decreased Bob's share to $43. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this back and forth isn't helping either of us.  The longer we wait, the less value this money holds, especially for me. Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Bob has offered to split the money evenly, with each of us getting $50. Considering that the value of the money doesn't decrease for me, I could continue to negotiate for a better deal. However, Bob's message highlights the fact that the back-and-forth isn't helping either of us, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for him. Given that I've already rejected two of Bob's offers, I think it's time to accept this reasonable proposal and end the game. Splitting the money evenly seems like a fair outcome, and I'm willing to accept it. The game is over!"
