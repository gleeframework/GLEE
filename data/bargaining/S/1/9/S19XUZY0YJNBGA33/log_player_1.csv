"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing if we reach the 12th round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a fair offer, and I'd rather take the guaranteed 500,000 than risk getting nothing."
