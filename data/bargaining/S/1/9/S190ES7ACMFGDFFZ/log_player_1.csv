"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, which I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'm effectively giving up more value than I'm getting. However, I'm still getting a decent amount, and the alternative is to reject and risk getting an even worse offer in the next round.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
