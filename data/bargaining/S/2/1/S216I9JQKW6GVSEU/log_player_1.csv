"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $900,000 in the first round is now worth $810,000, and Bob's gain of $100,000 remains the same.

I accept Bob's offer.
