"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to keep $900,000 for myself, and give $100,000 to Bob. This seems like a fair first offer considering the inflation rate. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal.  Even with the inflation, I'm still getting a better deal by rejecting and making my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself.  This is a more equitable split considering the inflation rates, and I think it's a reasonable offer for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is still less than my ideal outcome, the inflation rate has significantly eroded the value of the money for both of us. It's better to accept this offer and secure a portion of the remaining value than to risk getting nothing at all in future rounds."
