45.0,55.0,"Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. Let's split the difference and go for a 55/45 split.  It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Let's be reasonable here. Inflation is hitting us both, so a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. It's a chance for us to get something, rather than risk losing everything.",Alice,3,

48.0,52.0,"Alice, we need to factor in the inflation. It's hitting me harder, so 50/50 isn't quite fair. How about 52/48? It's a small adjustment, but every bit counts with this inflation.",Bob,4,
