"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. I've included a message suggesting that this is a fair split, in the hopes that Bob will accept it and we can end the game here. Since there's no inflation on the first round, the money is still worth its full value. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it evenly, but since we're playing a game, I'll take 60% this time.  Let's see what you do. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'm not willing to accept only $4,000. Since Bob's gain is not affected by inflation, they're actually getting a better deal than I am. I'll hold out for a better offer or try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a division of $5,800 for myself and $4,200 for Bob. Given that the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I've adjusted the split to try and find a more mutually acceptable agreement. Let's see how Bob responds to this proposal!"
