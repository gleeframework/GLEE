"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering your offer was already in your favor.  Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being generous, but I'm not convinced!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the initial proposal was already in my favor. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm holding out for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52% for you is too high. I'll give you 52, but I'll take 48.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
