Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, I'm being generous despite inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take more, you're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

It's getting too risky now.  While not ideal, accepting 4000 is better than risking an even lower amount in the next round as inflation eats away at the total."
