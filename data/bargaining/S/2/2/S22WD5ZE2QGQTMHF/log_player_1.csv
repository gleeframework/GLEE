"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good foundation""}

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, where I get 7,000 and Bob gets 3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as keen on giving up as much as I was in the first round. Bob's offer of a 50:50 split is tempting, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm proposing a 6:4 split, where I get 6,000 and Bob gets 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise a bit, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is really losing value quickly!

I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I did in the previous rounds, but Bob's offer is still a bit better than the original 6:4 split I proposed. I'm not sure if I can do any better, so I'll decide to accept this offer.
