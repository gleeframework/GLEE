"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the original amount, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'll have to adjust my thinking.

In this case, Bob's 50/50 offer is actually a pretty good one, considering the decreasing value of money. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject the offer for now. I'm hoping to do better in the next round.
