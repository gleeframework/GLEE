I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm giving Bob something to make it worthwhile for him to accept.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm getting a bit less due to inflation, I still think I can negotiate a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm increasing Bob's share a bit to make the offer more tempting. Hopefully, he'll realize that his chances of getting a bigger slice are diminishing with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting a much smaller portion of the money due to inflation, it's still better than nothing. Bob is clearly in a stronger position now, and if I reject, I risk getting nothing at all in the next round.  It's time to take what I can get."
