"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20 to get started!""

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll consider the offer carefully.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 55/45 split. I'd rather not give up that much. I'll reject this offer.
