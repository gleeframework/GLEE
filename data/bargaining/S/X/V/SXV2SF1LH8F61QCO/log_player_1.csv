"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\n

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more equitable split this time. This offer considers the decreasing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4500 is actually worth $3600 in terms of the original value. Given this, I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation again, I'll adjust my offer to make sure I get a fair share. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Countering with a slightly better split for me, considering the inflation!""}\n\n

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's settle this fairly with a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds fair at first glance, but considering the inflation, my gain of $5000 is actually worth only about $2560 in terms of the original value. That's a pretty bad deal for me! I think I'll try to get a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the significant impact of inflation on my gain, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Inflation is killing me! Need a better split to make up for it.""}\n\n

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
