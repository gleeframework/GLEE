"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to secure a large portion of the money early on.  It's a gamble, as Bob might reject it and force you to negotiate further in the next round. But, by offering a significant portion to Bob, it shows you are willing to compromise while still prioritizing your own gain."
