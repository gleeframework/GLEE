"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""

Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair proposal, but I'm not ready to give up just yet.
