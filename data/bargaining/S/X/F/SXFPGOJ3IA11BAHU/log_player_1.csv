I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  I'm giving him $100,000, which is a pretty good chunk of change. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is a lot less generous than mine.  It's clear that he's going to try to squeeze more out of me.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to go a bit lower than my first offer but still offer a decent amount to Bob, hoping to find a compromise.  Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim for a larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This offer is still quite lopsided in Bob's favor. While the money is worth less, I'm not desperate enough to settle for such a small share. I'm hoping that Bob will eventually realize that he needs to compromise to get any money at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I believe I can still get a good deal.  Bob needs to realize that if we keep going, the amount of money he can get will keep shrinking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a much closer offer, and it's clear that Bob is starting to feel the pressure of inflation. Even though I'm getting a smaller share than I hoped for, it's still a significant amount of money, and the longer we keep going, the less there will be to divide.  I'll accept this offer."
