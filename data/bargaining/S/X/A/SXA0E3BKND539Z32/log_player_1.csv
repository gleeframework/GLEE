"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent offer. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 40$ is now worth 36$ (since it's 10% less than the 40$ in the previous round).

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'm getting a smaller share, I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more. Can you meet me at 45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my offer is now worth even less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I need some. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm giving Bob a larger share in the hopes that he'll accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm trying to be fair. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains. With the 27.1% decrease, my gain of 30$ is now worth only 21.9$ (since 30 * 0.271 = 8.13, and 30 - 8.13 = 21.87, rounding to 21.9).

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'm getting a smaller share, I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more. Can you meet me at 35?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my gains. With the money being worth 27.1% less than the first round, my offer is now worth even less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 18,
  ""bob_gain"": 82,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate. I'll give you most of it. Please take it!""
}
```

I'm giving Bob a very large share in the hopes that he'll accept and we can wrap up the game."
