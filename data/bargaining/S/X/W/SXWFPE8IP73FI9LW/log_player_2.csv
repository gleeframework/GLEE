Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 40. Let's split it 55/45. We can still both come out ahead.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a bit more than 42. Let's split it 52/48. This is a fair compromise, and we can both get something before inflation eats away at our profits. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While her offers are becoming more ""generous,"" they are still tilted in her favor.  By continuing to reject and propose slightly better offers for myself, I can likely get Alice to agree to a deal where I receive at least $60 before the time runs out."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 59, ""alice_gain"": 41, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and every round hurts you more than it hurts me. This offer is fair, and it lets us both walk away with something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand time is running out, but I can't accept a deal where I'm getting so much less. 51/49 is the best I can do, and it's still a fair compromise. Let's make a deal before we both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but I need to recognize the shifting power dynamic. The longer the negotiation goes, the more leverage Alice gains.  While I'd prefer a 60/40 split, accepting 49/51 now guarantees I get something before inflation eats away at the deal even further. Alice's last message suggests she might be less willing to compromise in future rounds.  It's better to take a decent offer now than risk ending up with nothing."
