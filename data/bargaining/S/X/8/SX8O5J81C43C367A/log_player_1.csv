"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split to start, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, aiming to get a slightly higher share this time."
