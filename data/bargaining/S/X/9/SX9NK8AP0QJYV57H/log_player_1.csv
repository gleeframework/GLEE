Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle and make it a fair 45/55 split. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and we can end the game before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
