"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm being generous, let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the 20% inflation rate for me, accepting 10 dollars in the first round would be equivalent to 8 dollars in the next round, which I think is too low. I'm hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation rate for both of us. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice in each round, I'll try to find a balance that benefits both parties. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle and make it a fair 45/55 split. This way, we both get a reasonable amount, and we can end the game before the money loses more value.""}"
