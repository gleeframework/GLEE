"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a fair share to keep things friendly.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I'm hoping this will set a good tone for the game and give Bob a chance to think about whether he wants to accept or counteroffer."
