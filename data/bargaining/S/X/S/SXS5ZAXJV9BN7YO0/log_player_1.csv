```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"

Round 2

# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my effective gain is now 47.5 (95% of 50). Bob's offer is still better than my previous one, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.
