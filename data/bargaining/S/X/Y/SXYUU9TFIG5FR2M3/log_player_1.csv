"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000. I've included a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so I'm trying to get a good deal while I can. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this is a fair offer considering the inflation working against both of us. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less now due to inflation, I still think I can get a better deal. Since the inflation affects me more than Bob, I want to try to get as much as I can in the next round. Let's see what happens next!###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Inflation is costing me more, so I need a bit more""}\n\nI've decided to offer Bob $420,000 and take $580,000 for myself. Since the inflation is affecting me more than Bob, I've explained my reasoning in the message, hoping Bob will understand my position and accept the offer. Let's see how Bob responds!###"
