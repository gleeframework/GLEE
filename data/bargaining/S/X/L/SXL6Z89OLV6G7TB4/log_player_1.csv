"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a straightforward offer. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering to take the entire $100, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a guaranteed win and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since I value my gain at the same rate as in the first round, I'll accept the offer, but I'll have to keep in mind that the value of Bob's gain is 20% less due to inflation.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
