Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money I gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round due to inflation, but for Alice, the value remains the same. I previously rejected Alice's offer of $350,000 for me and $650,000 for her.

### Step 2: Calculate the effective value of my gain considering inflation
Since the money I gain is worth 9.75% less, I need to calculate the effective value of any amount I propose for myself. However, for simplicity in negotiations, the actual figures proposed will not directly reflect this calculation, but it influences my decision-making.

### Step 3: Determine a reasonable offer
Given the pressure of inflation and the need to conclude the game in a favorable position, I need to balance between making an offer that is attractive enough for Alice to accept and ensuring I get a significant share.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer and message
I will increase my proposed share slightly from the last round, considering Alice's previous offer and the impact of inflation. My message will aim to convey the urgency and fairness of the proposal.

### Step 5: Finalize the offer
I decide to offer myself $420,000 and Alice $580,000, with a message emphasizing the need to settle given the decreasing value for me.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, I believe this offer is a fair compromise for both of us to settle on.""}"
