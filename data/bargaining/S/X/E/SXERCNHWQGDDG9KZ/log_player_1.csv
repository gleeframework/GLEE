"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is a very aggressive first offer, aiming to get the most money possible for Alice.  While it's unlikely Bob will accept, it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is much more reasonable than the first, it's still not beneficial to Alice in the long run.  With each round, the money Bob gains is worth less, making it more advantageous to reject and see if he'll make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This offer is a compromise, giving Alice a significant share but also acknowledging that Bob needs to receive something for his participation.  It's a step towards finding a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though Bob's offer is lower than what Alice would ideally prefer, it's important to consider the ongoing inflation.  With each round, Bob's share is worth significantly less. Accepting this offer guarantees Alice a substantial amount of money, and further rounds might not yield a better result."
