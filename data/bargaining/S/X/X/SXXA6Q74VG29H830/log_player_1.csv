"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
I propose that I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000.  This is a fair starting point, giving me a slight advantage as the first proposer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred to keep a larger share, the 5% inflation means it's in my best interest to accept this offer. A 50/50 split is fair given the current circumstances."
