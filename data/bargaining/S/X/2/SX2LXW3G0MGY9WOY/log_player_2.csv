"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value due to the first round of inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, and considering the offer from Alice, I'll calculate my share in terms of the original 100$. If I accept this offer, I'll gain 45$ in the current round, which is equivalent to 45 / 0.64 = 70.31 in the original round. This is less than my previous offer, so I'll accept this offer.
