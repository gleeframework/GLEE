"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the lion's share""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% of the total amount and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly, as both of us should benefit equally from this division. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, as I'd like to get a bigger share. The money is worth less to me due to inflation, so I'd like to negotiate further. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, where I get 60% of the total amount and Bob gets 40%."
