"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small amount and let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. This is a more equitable split, considering the future inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this over with, Bob.  This is a fair split considering the inflation and I'm sure we both have better things to do. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'm accepting Alice's offer.  While the inflation has significantly devalued the money, this is a better outcome than potentially getting nothing in the next round."
