Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point given the inflation differential, and hopefully, it will be accepted quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is fair given the inflation and Bob's rejection of my previous offer. Accepting this will ensure I get at least half of the money."
