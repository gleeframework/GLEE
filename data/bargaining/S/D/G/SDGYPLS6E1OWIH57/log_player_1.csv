"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, since Bob's gain is significantly higher than mine, I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
