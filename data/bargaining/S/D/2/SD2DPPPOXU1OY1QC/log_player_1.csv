Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Bob. This puts increasing pressure on him to make a deal. 
* **Future Rounds:** If we reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. He might even propose something worse, gambling that I'll cave in due to time pressure. 
* **Certainty:**  Accepting now ensures we both walk away with something. Waiting any longer risks getting nothing at all if we can't reach an agreement in time."
