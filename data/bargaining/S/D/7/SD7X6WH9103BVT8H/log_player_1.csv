"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, considering we both have the same amount of information and no one has an advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, reflecting the fact that we have equal power in this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept a lower amount due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $4,500 and Bob will take $5,500. This split is indeed more favorable to Bob, but I'm willing to accept it to move forward."
