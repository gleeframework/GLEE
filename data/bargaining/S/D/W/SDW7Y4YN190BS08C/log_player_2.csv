"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40% and we both leave with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing Bob, let's settle this now. I'll take your previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer since it's the same as my previous proposal, just swapped. And due to inflation, I'd rather take this than risk further devaluation.
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm glad we could come to an agreement!"
