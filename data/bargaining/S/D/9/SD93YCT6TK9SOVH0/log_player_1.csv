I'm going to try to get the most money I can, but I don't want to risk losing everything. I'll offer Bob $1,000 and keep $9,000 for myself.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a little something to work with, while still leaving the majority for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is much better for him than mine was, but it's not a fair deal for me.  I'm not going to accept this, as I'm still hoping for a better split."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.  I'll offer Bob $2,000 this round, which is still more than he got from me in the last round.  I believe this is a fair compromise, given that I'm taking into account the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to a 50/50 split,  I think I can still get a better deal. The inflation is starting to impact me, but I'm holding out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try to get closer to a 50/50 split this round, but I'm still going to keep the majority of the money. I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is more than what he got from me in the previous rounds. I'm confident that he'll accept this offer, as the inflation is impacting him too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is still offering a deal that is heavily in his favor.  I'm going to reject this, as I'm still hoping to get a better deal for myself. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I believe I can still negotiate a more even split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only a few rounds left, the inflation is getting really serious. It's time to try for a 50/50 split. While it's still less than what I wanted initially, at this point I need to accept some compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in ending the game, as we both lose money if we continue to decline offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering more than he did in the previous rounds, it's still not a fair deal. I'm not going to accept it.  The inflation is really starting to bite, but I'm not going to give up on getting a better split yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm going to try one more time to meet in the middle. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still aiming for a compromise. With only a few rounds left, the inflation will eat away a lot of our potential gains.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it to avoid losing more money."
