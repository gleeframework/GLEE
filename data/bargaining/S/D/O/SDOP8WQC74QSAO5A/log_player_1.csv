"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, given the value of money decreases with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, the new amounts are:

Alice's gain: $4,500 (worth 95% of $4,800, which is 40% of $10,000)
Bob's gain: $5,500 (worth 95% of $5,800, which is 58% of $10,000)

I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, and considering the decreasing value of money, I'm willing to accept this offer.
