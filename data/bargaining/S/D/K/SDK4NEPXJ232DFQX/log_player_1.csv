"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my gain. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, which means he's getting a smaller share than he would have in the first round.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the next round, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 700,000, and my offer in round 1 was 600,000, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze Bob's new offer. Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting a decent share. However, Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Considering this, I'll decide to accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
