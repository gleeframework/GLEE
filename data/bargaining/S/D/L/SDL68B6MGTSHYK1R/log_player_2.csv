"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and gives us both a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want a better deal than 4000.  I'll see what Alice's counter-offer is."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money will decline with each round.  Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and this money is losing value fast. My offer is still on the table - let's be sensible and take it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, time is running out and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  It's better to take this offer than risk getting nothing."
