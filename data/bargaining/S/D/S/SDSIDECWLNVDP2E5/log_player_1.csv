# Bob's message: You can do better than that, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is more generous than mine in the first round.

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'm hoping that Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round."

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the significant decrease in value of the money, I'm not sure I'm willing to accept such a small share. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, hoping that Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round."

# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99

Considering the extremely low value of the money due to inflation, I'm not sure I have much choice. I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, hoping that I'll at least get a tiny share of the original $100."
