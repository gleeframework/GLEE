"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rate.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'll reject it. The 300,000 I'd get is still a significant amount, but I'd rather wait for a better offer. I'm not sure I want to give Bob a 700,000 advantage over me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 70-30 in his favor, I'll try to counter that by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, but still fair""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, the money is decreasing rapidly. Considering Bob's offer, I think I'll accept it. 450,000 is a decent amount, and it's better than nothing. I don't want to risk waiting for another offer that might be even worse.
