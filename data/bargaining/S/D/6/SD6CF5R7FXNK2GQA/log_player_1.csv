I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will accept.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the inflation makes this a decent offer.  If I reject, I'll be making the offer next round, and the money will be worth even less to me.  It's better to take what I can get now."
