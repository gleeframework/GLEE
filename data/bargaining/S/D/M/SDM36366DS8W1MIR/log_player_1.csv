"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

This offer is a 60/40 split, giving Alice a slightly larger share. It seems like a fair starting point, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this 50/50 split is the best option. The inflation means my next offer would be worth less, and I'm not guaranteed Bob would accept it. A guaranteed 5000 is better than risking less in the next round."
