"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly. Considering the new offer, I'll accept Bob's proposal:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take 40% of the remaining value, and Bob will take 60%."
