"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value faster for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer seems fair at first glance, the fact that the money depreciates faster for me means that I'll be losing more value over time. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I appreciate the fairness of your offer, but I believe this split better reflects the faster depreciation of the money for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us.  This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's important to consider that the money is losing value quickly for both of us. Accepting this offer ensures that I receive at least something, and further rounds might leave me with nothing at all."
