"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is more than fair. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The inflation is working against me, Bob. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it's your final offer, but I'm willing to make one more deal. Considering the inflation, I think I'm being generous. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Although this offer is the same as Bob's initial offer, the impact of inflation is becoming severe. Accepting $4,000 now is better than risking another round where the value diminishes further, potentially leaving me with even less."
