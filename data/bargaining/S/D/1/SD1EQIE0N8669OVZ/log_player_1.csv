"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal if you don't take this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll consider my options.

I'm not convinced that I'm getting the better deal, but I also don't want to risk losing out on a potentially good offer. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but don't think I'll go any lower!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 500$ to try to make the deal more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being generous, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I'm being taken advantage of. Bob's offer seems similar to the one I made in round 3, but with a slightly better deal for him. I'm not sure if I want to give him even more.

However, I don't want to keep rejecting his offers and risk getting stuck with a bad deal. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
