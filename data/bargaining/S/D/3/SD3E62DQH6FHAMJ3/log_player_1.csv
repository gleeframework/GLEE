"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can see where the negotiations go from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is 3000:7000, which is 3:7. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You offered me 3/7, I'll give you 5.5/7. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better ratio for myself, but still leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is eating away at our gains!

Considering the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is 4500:5500, which is 9:11.5. I'm not thrilled about this, but I'm not sure I can do better either.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""You wanted to meet me halfway, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better ratio for myself, but still leave room for negotiation."
