"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my fair offer, now it's my turn to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting aggressive!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'll get are:

* My gain: 20 * 0.8 = 16 (due to 20% inflation)
* Bob's gain: 80 * 0.95 = 76 (due to 5% inflation)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept this offer.
