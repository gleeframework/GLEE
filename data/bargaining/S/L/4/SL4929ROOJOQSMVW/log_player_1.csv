"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for the majority of the money, but leaving a small amount for Bob to encourage him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than the previous round, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially since we have 10 more rounds to go!  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

I'm going to try to push for a bit more this round. Bob knows he's losing out on value with each round, so I'm hoping this offer is enough to entice him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more tempting, but I'm still not satisfied. I know he's losing value each round, so I'm going to hold out for a bit longer.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to try a slightly more aggressive offer this round.  Bob is losing value quickly, so I need to strike while the iron is hot!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While I'd prefer more, the inflation is really starting to bite, and Bob's offer is getting increasingly attractive. It's a good deal for me, and it's better than risking getting nothing."
