"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject the 50/50 offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I need a bit more, 55% for me, 45% for you""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to squeeze out a bit more value. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. 5200 is a good deal considering the reduced value of money. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'd rather settle now than risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds."
