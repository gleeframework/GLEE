Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a bigger share this time. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.
