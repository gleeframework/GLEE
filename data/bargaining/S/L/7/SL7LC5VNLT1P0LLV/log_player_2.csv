"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer heavily favors me, Bob, but it's the best you'll get in the early rounds.  The longer we wait, the less your share is worth to you due to inflation. Let's get this settled quickly! 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a more balanced split that recognizes the time pressure we both face.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like you're feeling the inflation already. I'm offering you the same amount you would have received last round, which is worth considerably less now. Take it while you can!  
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but I need to hold a little longer. Accepting this offer would mean I get significantly less than half the money, and the value for me is decreasing rapidly with each round.  There's still a chance to negotiate a better deal, even with the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, you're right about the time pressure, but I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  This offer is my bottom line.  Let's wrap this up and both come out ahead.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a risky move, as the offer is slightly in my favor now. However, the inflation is rapidly eroding my potential gains.  By framing this as my ""bottom line,"" I'm hoping to convince Alice to accept before the deal gets even worse for me in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm acknowledging the time pressure with this offer. It's more than you would get if you waited for the next round.  Don't let greed get in the way of a decent deal! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's painful to accept less than half, but the inflation is killing me. This offer is barely above what I'd get if I rejected it and made a successful offer next round. Alice is playing hardball, and it's time to cut my losses and get what I can before the deal gets even worse."
