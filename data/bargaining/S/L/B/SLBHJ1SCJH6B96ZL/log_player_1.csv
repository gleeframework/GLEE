Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer in my favor. I figure that Bob might accept it, especially since he doesn't know about the inflation factor. If he doesn't, at least I get to make another offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than my initial offer, it's still a significant gain. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all due to the inflation factor.  I'll take the $100,000 and move on."
