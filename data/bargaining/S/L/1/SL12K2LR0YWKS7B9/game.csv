6000.0,4000.0,Let's split it 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us in the first round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the money will lose value quickly. Let's split it evenly in the next round if you decline this offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,I understand your point about the decreasing value. How about a 55/45 split? It's closer to even but still gives us a slight advantage considering we proposed first.,Alice,3,
