"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm the one taking the risk of inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","A clever counteroffer from Bob! 

However, I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, considering I'm the one making the initial offer. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation risk, but also gives me a slightly better share.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the initial offer. Let's try 55/45.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. This way, we both get a decent share, and I get a slight edge due to the initial offer.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this compromise!"
