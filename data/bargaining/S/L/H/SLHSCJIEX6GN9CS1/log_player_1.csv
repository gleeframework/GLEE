"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\nI made the first offer, giving myself $60 and Bob $40, with a message suggesting a fair split. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more even split, given that we'll have fewer rounds to negotiate if we agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept Bob's offer of $40 for me and $60 for him. It's still early in the game, and I think I can negotiate a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, suggesting that we meet in the middle. This is a more generous offer than my initial one, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
