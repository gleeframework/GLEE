Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation is still affecting the money's value, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's previous offer had a 60/40 split, I'll try to adjust it to my advantage. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

I'm offering a 58/42 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I think Bob's offer is still relatively generous. I'll accept this offer.
