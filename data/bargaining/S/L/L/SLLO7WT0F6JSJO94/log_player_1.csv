"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the money is worth 5% less for you now.""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd like to get a bit more, considering the value of the money has decreased for Bob. Now it's my turn to make a new offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and not giving too much away. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give up too much either! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take it. It's a decent offer.""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer because, considering the decreasing value of the money, 4500 is a reasonable amount for me, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer."
