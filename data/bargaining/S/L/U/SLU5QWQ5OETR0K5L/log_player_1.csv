Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking 990,000 dollars for myself and giving Bob 10,000 dollars. This seems fair since I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even though I'm losing 20% of the money each round,  I can still get a better deal than 100,000. I'll try to negotiate a better share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob 100,000 dollars and taking 900,000 for myself. This is still a significant gain for Bob, and it's a better offer than the 100,000 he offered me last round. I'm hoping he'll accept this and we can avoid further inflation."
