"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 200,000 is a decent starting point, I'm not convinced Alice will be as generous in the future.  I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's more equitable than your last offer and gives us both a good share of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to offer a 64/36 split. It's a fair deal, and I think we can both walk away with a decent amount of money. 
# Bob gain: 360000 
# Alice gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option at this point. The inflation will only continue to decrease my share, and there's no guarantee Alice will be as generous in future rounds. This gives me a decent amount, and I'm willing to cut my losses."
