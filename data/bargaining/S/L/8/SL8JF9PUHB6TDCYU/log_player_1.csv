Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. We both lose out with continued inflation. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering I'm willing to take the risk on further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
