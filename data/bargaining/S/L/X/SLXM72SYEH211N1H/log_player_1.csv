"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower amount, but I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this case, I think Bob's offer is a bit too skewed towards him, considering the inflation effect. I'd like to propose a counteroffer to try to get a more balanced split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make a counteroffer: 4200 for me, 5800 for you""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. I'll try to get a better deal considering the inflation effect.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share! Considering the huge discount on Bob's share due to inflation, I think I can afford to be a bit more generous.

However, I still think Bob's offer is a bit too skewed towards him, considering the original amount and the inflation effect.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make a counteroffer: 3200 for me, 6800 for you""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. Considering the significant inflation effect on Bob's share, I'm willing to make a more substantial concession to try to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to feel like I'm getting a fair deal too""
}
```"
