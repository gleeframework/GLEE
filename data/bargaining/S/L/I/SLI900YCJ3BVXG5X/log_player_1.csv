"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I'm framing it as a fair split to see if Bob will accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to be too generous just yet. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $70 gain from the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's worth $56.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'm willing to consider it since it's a better offer than my initial 70-30 split. I'll accept this offer to avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation.
