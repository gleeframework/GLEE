Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation disadvantage I'll face. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
