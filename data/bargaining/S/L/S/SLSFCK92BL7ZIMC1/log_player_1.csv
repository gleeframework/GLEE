"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount is $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I can do better. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the numbers are now:

Alice's gain: 300,000 * 0.8 = 240,000
Bob's gain: 700,000 * 0.8 = 560,000

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""It's time for a 50-50 split, Bob. Let's call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable offer considering the current state of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're close to a 50-50 split, but I think I can get a slightly better deal. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the numbers are now:

Alice's gain: 450,000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 231,600
Bob's gain: 550,000 * 0.516 = 283,200

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's still a bit skewed in his favor. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up on a 50-50 split, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get closer to a 50-50 split, while still being slightly in my favor."
