I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping to secure a large portion of the money quickly.  However, I'm aware of the inflation risk, so I'm not going to go for a completely unreasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

The offer is the same, but the value to me is 20% lower. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

Since Bob rejected my initial offer, I know he's willing to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a significant portion, but I'm lowering my share by 100,000 to see if it's enough to secure a deal. The inflation is a serious factor, so I need to be mindful of the decreasing value of my earnings."
