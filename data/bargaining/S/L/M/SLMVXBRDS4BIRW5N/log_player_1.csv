"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you'll get 40%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll still give you a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is quite generous. I'll take it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
