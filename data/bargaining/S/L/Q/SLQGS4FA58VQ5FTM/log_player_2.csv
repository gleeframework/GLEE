Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing with each round due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows Bob is experiencing inflation and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better in a future round.  She's likely to stick close to the 43/57 split.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk of getting an even worse deal in a future round, with no guarantee of a better outcome. 

While 43 is less than Bob's previous offers, it's better to take a slightly smaller amount now than risk losing even more value to inflation."
