"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split, hoping to secure a large portion early on. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the 20% loss in value, taking $5000 is better than risking a further decline in value and potentially getting nothing at all."
