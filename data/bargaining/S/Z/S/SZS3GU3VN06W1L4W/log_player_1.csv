I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob just $1.  I figure he'll take it, since anything is better than nothing in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though inflation has reduced my share by 20%, I'm still getting half the money. It's better to take what I can get now, as there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round."
