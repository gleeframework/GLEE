"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for a large portion of the money.  It's a gamble - if Bob is greedy, he might reject it hoping for a better deal later.  However, if he's risk-averse, he might accept it, as the inflation will only decrease his share in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While a 50/50 split is tempting, it's crucial to remember that I'm at a disadvantage due to inflation.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counter-proposal in the next round and hopefully secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than the previous round, but still a significant amount.  The inflation will make his share worth less in the next round, so he might be inclined to accept this offer.  I need to strike a balance between securing a good deal for myself and making sure Bob doesn't completely walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting worse for me with each round, but I'm still not going to accept. I'm willing to gamble a little longer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

It's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers, but with the inflation working against me, it's a bit of a gamble. I'm offering a 50/50 split now, hoping Bob will accept.  If he doesn't, the odds get significantly worse for me in the coming rounds."
