"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 70/30.  Let's settle this quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more equitable split. Let's be reasonable and avoid further losses from inflation.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer was heavily in her favor.  It made sense to reject it and counter with a proposal that reflects a fairer split.
* **Proposed Split (4800/5200):** While this offer gives Alice a slightly larger share, it's important to consider the faster rate of inflation for Bob. Accepting this offer now might be better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds.
* **Message:**  The message aims to:
    * Highlight the unfairness of Alice's initial offer.
    * Position Bob's offer as a reasonable compromise.
    * Introduce a sense of urgency to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair deal, but time is working against you more than me. This is my final offer before I have to propose something much less favorable to you. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a strong psychological game, but her offer is still not good enough. Here's why:

* **Alice's Advantage is Decreasing:** While inflation impacts Bob more severely, the difference in its effect is lessening with each round. Alice's advantage is slowly shrinking.
* **Future Rounds:** If Alice is true to her word, her next offer will be significantly worse for Bob. However, it's also likely that her desperation to secure a deal will increase if Bob rejects this offer. She may be willing to make a much fairer offer in Round 4. 
* **Holding Strong:** By rejecting this offer, Bob shows he's serious about getting a reasonable deal and is willing to play the long game, even with the negative impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.  Let's close this out and avoid further losses.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** This offer represents a clear movement towards a more balanced deal.  While still favoring Alice, it shows Bob is willing to compromise. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the need to close the deal quickly to mitigate the effects of inflation on *both* players.
* **Final Offer Implication:**  Although not explicitly stated, offering a 50/50 split with a slight edge to Alice could be interpreted as Bob's final concession. It puts the pressure on Alice to accept or risk a potentially worse outcome in subsequent rounds."
