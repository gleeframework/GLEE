"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount in the hopes of getting a better deal later. It's risky, but the inflation could work in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than mine, and the inflation doesn't seem to be affecting my side too much. I'll take it!"
