Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the risk of inflation and the limited rounds, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor to expedite the process.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money at this point, considering the risk of further inflation. Let's be rational and call it even. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\n### I accept Alice's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the impact of inflation and the decreasing value of the money with each passing round, accepting this offer ensures that I receive a significant portion of the remaining value without risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. It seems like a fair and rational decision at this point in the game."
