"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose keeping 9000 for myself and giving 1000 to Bob. This ensures that I receive the majority of the money and leaves some for Bob. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Since I gain 5000, even with the 10% inflation, that's still more than I'd get if I reject and Bob gets to propose again.  There's no guarantee he'll be as generous next round."
