Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal. I know Alice's offer won't be as good later, but I'm willing to gamble that I can get more!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money 60/40, with me getting the bigger share since I'm the one taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's finish this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable. The value is decreasing with each round. This offer is fair and benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is now better than my previous one, and the inflation is starting to hurt her. I'll accept and take the money."
