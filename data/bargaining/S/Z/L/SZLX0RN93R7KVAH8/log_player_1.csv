"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a division of $900,000 for myself and $100,000 for Bob. I want to secure a large share while leaving Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering me $400,000, which is significantly less than my initial proposal.  Even though inflation is hurting me, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $700,000 for myself, hoping to find a compromise that Bob will accept.  I'm still taking a large share, but it's more realistic given Bob's rejection of my initial offer and the fact that I'm losing money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still not enough. I'm still losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, and I believe I can do better. I'll try to negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm further lowering my offer to $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob. Inflation is really taking its toll now, but I still believe a more even split is possible.  I'm hoping that Bob sees the value of reaching a compromise soon before we both lose too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has taken a substantial bite out of the money, I'm finally seeing a split that's approaching a more even distribution.  Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than anything I've seen before.  It's time to accept and avoid further potential losses from inflation."
