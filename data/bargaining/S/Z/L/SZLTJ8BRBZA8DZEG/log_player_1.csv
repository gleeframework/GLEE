"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the fairness in my proposal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 95% of the original amount, and Bob's gain is worth 90% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best idea, considering the inflation. I'd rather aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need a decent share""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 6000, trying to balance the risk of inflation and the need to get a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the middle, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 86.74% of the original amount, and Bob's gain is worth 72.9% of the original amount.

I'm getting closer to the middle, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'd rather try to get a bit more, considering the inflation is still eating away at the value of the money.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth it""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that balances the need for a decent share with the risk of inflation."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 77.38% of the original amount, and Bob's gain is worth 59.05% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if meeting halfway is the best idea, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I'd rather try to get a bit more, but I'm also getting closer to the deadline.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's time to make a serious offer""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being realistic about the value of the money. Meeting halfway seems like a reasonable compromise, but I'm not committing to anything more."
