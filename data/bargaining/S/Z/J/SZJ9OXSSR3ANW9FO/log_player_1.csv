"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start by being generous and offering Bob a small amount. This ensures I get the majority of the money, and since I'm aware of the inflation rates, I'm betting that he'll accept this offer rather than risk getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial offer, and while the inflation hurts, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll reject this offer and force him to make a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but still keeping a larger share for myself. Inflation has affected the value of the money, so I need to be more flexible, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is starting to hit hard, I'm still not willing to settle for such a small share.  I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, but still keeping a majority share. The inflation is biting into the value of the money, and this is likely my best chance to secure a decent amount before it gets even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. The inflation has dramatically decreased the value of the money, and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round.  While I'd prefer a larger share,  it's better to secure at least something than risk getting nothing at all."
