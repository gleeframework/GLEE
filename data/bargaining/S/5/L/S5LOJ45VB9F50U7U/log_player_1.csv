Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with a message that says ""Let's be fair"". This way, I'm giving Bob a significant amount, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Since there's inflation involved, I want to try to end the game as quickly as possible to minimize the loss of value."
