"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 90% to me, 10% to you. Accept and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
It's a bit unfair to start with such a lopsided split. I'll propose a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way, we both get a fair share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Bob. 70% to me, 30% to you. This way, I can get a bit more, but we can still move forward. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering too much for herself. I'll try to negotiate a fairer split again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to give you 40% to ensure we can both agree. This is a fair compromise given the inflation affecting your side.""}
