"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative value of the offer. In this round, I'd be gaining $750,000, which is worth 75% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob would gain $250,000, which is worth 25% of the original $1,000,000.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I think this offer is a good one for me, and I'll accept it.
