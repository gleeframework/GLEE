Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  We both lose money with each round, and this ensures neither of us feels cheated. Let's end this now and secure our share. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
