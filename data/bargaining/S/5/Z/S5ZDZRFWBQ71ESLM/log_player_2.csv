{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but I think it's important to recognize that delaying agreement comes at a cost for me due to inflation. How about we try a 60/40 split in my favor?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation factor, Bob.  I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but 60/40 is too much.  Let's try a 55/45 split, which is fairer to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
