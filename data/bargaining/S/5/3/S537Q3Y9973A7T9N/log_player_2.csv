Let's see what Alice proposes next!  I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering Alice a slightly smaller share, hoping she'll accept. I'm aiming for a 60/40 split in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me, considering the inflation.  I'd rather have a guaranteed $5000 than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
