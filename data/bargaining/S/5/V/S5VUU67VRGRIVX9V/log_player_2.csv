"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give away more than this.  Remember, the value of your share is going down with every round! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The threat of inflation is real, but accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half feels too risky. I need to demonstrate I'm willing to push this further to get a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair split considering the time pressure on my end. If you refuse, I'm prepared to gamble on a later round, even with the losses."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The pressure is on:**  With each round, my potential gains decrease. A sense of urgency needs to be communicated.
* **Appearing firm:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling I'm unwilling to be pushed much further. 
* **Slight concession:** I'm offering slightly more than Alice's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but only marginally.  

This is a calculated risk. Alice might be holding out for an even better deal, but the threat of me going to later rounds (and the potential for her to get *nothing* if I refuse a low offer later) might be enough to make her reconsider."
