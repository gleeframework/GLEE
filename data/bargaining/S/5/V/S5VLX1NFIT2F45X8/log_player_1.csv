This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, aiming to secure a large portion of the money. It acknowledges the potential for inflation, but still offers a substantial amount to Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation is significant. Accepting this offer means I'll gain $2000, which is 20% less than my initial offer of $9000, but still a decent amount. Since Bob has a higher share of the money now, it's likely that if I reject, he will offer me even less in the next round. Accepting is the best strategic move in this situation."
