I'm taking almost everything!  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each round, I figure he'll take anything rather than risk getting nothing at all.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not going to accept that! I'm still getting more value out of the money than Bob is.  I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy to my first offer, but since Bob is taking a bigger hit on his money, I'll give him a slightly bigger share.  This should still be a very favorable deal for me!"
