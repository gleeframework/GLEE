I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a larger share, it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing at all later due to inflation."
