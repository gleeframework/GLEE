"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'll start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the money quickly and avoid inflation.  Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly less than my initial proposal, and I'm confident I can do better.  Let's see if I can get a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'll reduce my offer slightly, but still keep a larger share for myself.  I'm hoping that Bob will be more willing to accept a slightly better deal than the one he offered me in the previous round."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. Inflation is starting to affect Bob's gains, and he might become more agreeable to a higher offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'll make a slight compromise, reducing my offer to 850,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer rather than risking a smaller share as inflation continues to bite into his potential gains."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but only slightly.  With inflation continuing to impact Bob, I believe he might be more likely to accept this offer rather than risking a smaller share in the next round.  I'm confident I can still get a favorable deal."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to being equal, inflation is really biting into his gains. I believe I can still get a more favorable deal in the next round. I'm not going to accept a 50/50 split when I know I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I believe Bob is starting to feel the pressure of inflation. With each round, his potential gains are diminishing. I think this offer is fair, considering the circumstances, and I hope he will accept it."

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unacceptable. Even though inflation is affecting his potential gains,  he's offering me a significantly smaller share than before. I'm not willing to give in to such an unfair deal.  I'm still confident I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer one last time, but I'm still hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer. Inflation is really hitting him hard now, and with only two rounds left, he might be more willing to compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insulting. While inflation is affecting him more than me, this is an unfair distribution.  I'm not going to accept such a small share, even with the time limit looming. It's better to get nothing than to be taken advantage of."
