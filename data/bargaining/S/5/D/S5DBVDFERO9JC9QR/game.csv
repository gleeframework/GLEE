900000.0,100000.0,I propose a 90/10 split. I believe this is a fair start given the potential for inflation. Let's be reasonable.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 7/3 is a more reasonable split considering the risk of inflation. Let's compromise.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but a 80/20 split is still fair considering the inflation risk. Let's work together to find a solution.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation risk. I'm trying to find a middle ground.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,Let's be practical. The inflation is really hitting us now. 70/30 is a reasonable split given the circumstances.  It's time to be realistic and find a compromise before we both lose more.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 50/50 split. I think it's time to find a compromise and avoid losing more value due to inflation. Let's split it down the middle.,Bob,6,
