Inflation is really biting now, so I need to get a significantly bigger share to make it worthwhile.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're getting close to the end of the game and that a deal is better than nothing."

I'm not going to accept such a meager share. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept such an unfair deal. It's been a tough negotiation, but I'm not willing to compromise my own interests so drastically."
