Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  I'm hoping Bob will be surprised and accept it, as he doesn't know about the inflation effect yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing a lot more than I hoped to due to the inflation, this offer is still better than what I'd get if I reject it.  With the inflation rate, I'm going to lose 5% of my potential gain on each additional round.  So, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount, whereas rejecting it could result in nothing if the game continues for many rounds."
