**Reasoning:** While I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, I need to start showing Alice I'm willing to compromise *slightly* as we run out of rounds. Accepting this offer would be too much of a concession right now. It's better to hold out a little longer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round or two."
