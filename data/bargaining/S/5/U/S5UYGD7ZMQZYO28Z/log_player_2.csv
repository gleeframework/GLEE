"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation will affect you more than me. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It acknowledges the inflation impacting me while still offering you a significant sum. Time is running out for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice is right, time is running out and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  Let's take the 4500 and be done with it."
