"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a fair split is tempting, the game clearly incentivizes negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's both get a good share.  I'm willing to split it more evenly, but I'm sure you understand the value of this game is decreasing with each round. ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're not taking this seriously, are you? I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go easy on you. 
# Bob gain: 370000 
# Alice gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to really hurt. Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, and accepting this offer secures a decent amount, even with the inflation.  It's not a great deal, but it's better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
