"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you a decent share. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. I'm trying to make a fair offer to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  We both get a good amount this way, and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the amount I'll receive. My gain of $500,000 is worth 90% of the original amount, since it's 10% less due to inflation. That's $450,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split, but the actual value of the money is lower due to inflation.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair offer. Don't want to wait too long and risk losing more value due to inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount, considering the inflation. I'm hoping he'll accept this one."
