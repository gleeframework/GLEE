"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you a decent share. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer. Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  We both get a good amount this way, and we can end the game.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair offer. Don't want to wait too long and risk losing more value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's frustrating that Alice is trying to take a larger share, I'm already losing value due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's not a huge loss compared to the initial offer."
