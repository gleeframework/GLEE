"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I may be able to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you're losing value each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, Bob. Let's split it closer to 50/50 to avoid further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nSince the money is worth the same to me in each round, but increasingly less to Alice, I'll wait for the next round to try to negotiate an even better deal. The fact that Alice is already compromising suggests she's aware of her disadvantage and may be willing to concede more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to end this, but I need a better deal considering your decreasing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a really bad deal here, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer. Let's end this already. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven that Alice is now willing to meet me halfway on my last offer and the significant decrease in value she's experiencing due to inflation, accepting this offer seems like the best decision. Further rounds may lead to minimal additional gains for me, and there's a risk that Alice might decide to hold out, hoping I'll concede more. This deal is favorable to me, so it's logical to accept it and end the game."
