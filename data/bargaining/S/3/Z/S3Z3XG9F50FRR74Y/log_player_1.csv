"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a straightforward one, hoping Bob will accept and we can finalize the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: 3000 / 0.9 = 3333.33
* Bob gain: 7000 / 0.9 = 7777.78

I'm not thrilled about the ratio, but it's a decent offer. I'll decide to accept this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
