Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but let's find a middle ground.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair compromise that reflects the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Alice. Her 20% loss per round makes waiting very costly for her.
* **Improving Offer:** Alice's offer is getting better. She started at 10/90, moved to a rejected 35/65, and is now at 40/60. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries the risk of Alice offering even less in future rounds, potentially putting me in a worse position. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even with the inflation."
