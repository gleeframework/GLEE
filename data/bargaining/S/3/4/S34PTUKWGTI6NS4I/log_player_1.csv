"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a decent share for you! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I don't think I'm comfortable with Bob taking the majority, especially since he's not offering a very generous share for me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a fair and reasonable split!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation and trying to give Bob a slightly larger share than I had initially. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking the lion's share now! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

I'm not happy with this offer, to say the least. With the inflation, my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and now Bob is offering me a tiny fraction of the total amount. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet! Let's try to find a middle ground!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, pushing for a slightly larger share for myself while still giving Bob a decent amount. I'm not sure if Bob will accept, but I'm willing to try!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of options, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential earnings now!

I'm not happy with this offer at all. With the inflation, my gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, and now Bob is offering me a tiny fraction of the total amount. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving in, I'll take what I can get!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more realistic now, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob has been pushing for a smaller share for me. I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to Bob, but I'm not getting my hopes up!"
