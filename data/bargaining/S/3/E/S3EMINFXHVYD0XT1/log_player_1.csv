"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can't do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, which means he's trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. If I reject it, I'll have to come up with a new proposal, and who knows what the inflation might do to the money then.

For now, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't get too comfortable!""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob a slightly smaller share of the pie. Let's see if he'll take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'm taking the middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which is a significant drop. I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think carefully about it.

I notice that Bob is trying to take the middle ground, which means he's trying to find a compromise. I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much more, but I'll consider it.

After weighing the options, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
