# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. With inflation affecting Bob's gain and not mine, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the inflation affecting Bob's gain. Since his money is worth 20% less with each passing round, I'll try to find a balance that might be acceptable to him while still favoring me.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. Although Bob emphasizes that this is his final offer and proposes a 50/50 split as the fairest option, considering the significant impact of inflation on his share, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. The fact that my share isn't affected by inflation gives me a stronger bargaining position. Let's see what happens in the next round!

{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant inflation impact, this is a reasonable adjustment""}\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this proposal. I've tried to be slightly more generous than before, acknowledging the increasing effect of inflation on his share. The message is straightforward, emphasizing the adjustment I've made in light of the inflation."
