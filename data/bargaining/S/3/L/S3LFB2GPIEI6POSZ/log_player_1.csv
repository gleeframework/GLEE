Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to end this quickly, but your initial offer wasn't fair in my eyes. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects that the value of the money decreases for you with every round. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
