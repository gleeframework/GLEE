```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly and avoid the inflation penalty.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible offer, and I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me.  I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm sticking with a similar split, but still offering Bob something. I hope he's starting to see that a win-win scenario is better for both of us than a long, drawn-out game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair. I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation, but I'm not going to let him bully me into a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still offering Bob a reasonable share. Inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm holding out for a more equitable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I still won't accept it. I'm losing a lot of money to inflation, but I'm determined to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, so I'm making a slightly smaller offer to Bob. But I still believe it's a reasonable split, and I'm hoping he'll finally accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy.  I'm losing a lot of money to inflation, but I won't accept such a lopsided deal.  I'll make a final stand in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm making a final compromise. We are both losing a lot of money to inflation, and I'm willing to take a bit less to get a deal done. Let's see if Bob finally understands that it's better to split the money than to lose it all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insulting. I'm not going to accept such a ridiculously unfair deal.  It's time to fight for what's fair, even if it means we both lose everything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only one round left, I'm offering an even split. I've lost a lot of money to inflation, but I'm still hoping Bob will see the value in sharing the remaining money equally. If he rejects this, we both get nothing."
