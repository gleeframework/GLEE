I'll start with a proposal that gives me the majority, but leaves Bob with something so he's not immediately incentivized to reject it.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to be greedy! He's basically flipping the script on my first offer. I'm not going to accept that. We'll see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a larger share this time to see if he's willing to compromise. I'm still aiming for the majority, but it's time to show some flexibility."
