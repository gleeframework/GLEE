"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I get $60 and you get $40. This is a good deal for you in the long run as the money loses value quickly! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair enough, considering the money loses value faster for me than for Alice. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a more reasonable split. The money loses value faster for me, so I think I should get a bit more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where I can offer you a decent amount. Accept this and we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think accepting this offer is the best choice. The difference in the loss of value between my gain and Alice's gain is substantial, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. This seems like a fair offer given the circumstances."
