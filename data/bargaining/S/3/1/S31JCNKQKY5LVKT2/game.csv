40.0,60.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me taking the larger share since I rejected your previous offer. Let's get this done!",Bob,2,
,,"That's not a fair deal, Bob. Let's be reasonable, the value is decreasing with each round.",Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Okay, Bob, how about a 55/45 split? We are losing value fast, let's be sensible and avoid getting nothing!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but a 55/45 split is the best I can do.  We're losing money with each round, let's make a deal!",Bob,4,
