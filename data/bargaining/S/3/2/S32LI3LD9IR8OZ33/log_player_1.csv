"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob is willing to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to get left with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd get $70 and he'd get $30. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll accept this offer.
