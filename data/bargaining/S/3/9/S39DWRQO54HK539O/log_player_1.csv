"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

I don't want to give Bob a larger share than I got in the first round, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share to try to get the deal done. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money is worth significantly less for me now, I'd rather not give Bob a larger share than he got in the previous round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving Bob too much. Your turn, Bob!"
