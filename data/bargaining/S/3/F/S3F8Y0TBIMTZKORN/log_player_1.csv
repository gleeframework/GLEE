Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be friends!""}### 

In this offer, Alice proposes to take $6000 for herself and give $4000 to Bob, with a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! This is a fair offer considering the inflation. Let's wrap it up. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I think I can get a better deal despite the inflation. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, considering inflation!""}### 

In this offer, I propose to split the money evenly between us, taking into account the reduced value due to inflation. I'm hoping this fair and straightforward approach will appeal to Bob and bring the game to a close.###"
