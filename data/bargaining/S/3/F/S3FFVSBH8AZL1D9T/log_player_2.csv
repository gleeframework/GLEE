Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the increasing inflation impact, I'm slightly adjusting my offer. This should be fair. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is trying to inch the offer in her favor. However, it's still early in the game, and Bob hasn't felt the effects of inflation yet. Holding out for a slightly better offer in the next few rounds is a good strategy."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on. This offer is a good compromise considering the inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for Bob to show some flexibility but also put a bit of pressure on Alice.  A slight increase in his previous offer shows willingness to negotiate, and the message emphasizes the time constraint and the risk they both face."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me hard, and I'm trying to find a middle ground. Let's agree on this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the heat of the inflation and trying to nudge the offer back in her favor. However, she's offering even less than Bob's previous proposal. Bob is in a strong position and can likely get a better deal by continuing to hold out, especially as time pressure mounts for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I've been flexible, but we're running out of time.  An even split is the fairest and ensures we both leave with something."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only five rounds left, the pressure is mounting, especially for Alice. It's crucial for Bob to emphasize the time constraint and the very real possibility of both losing.
* **Fairness:**  While Bob has the upper hand due to the inflation disparity, proposing a 50/50 split reinforces his position as being reasonable and willing to find a fair solution.
* **Finality:** This offer, coupled with the message, signals to Alice that this is Bob's final word.  He's sticking to his guns, and Alice needs to decide if she's willing to risk everything for a slightly larger share."
