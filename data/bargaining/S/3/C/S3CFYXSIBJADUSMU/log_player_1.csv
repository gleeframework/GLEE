"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice a large majority of the money, reflecting the fact that her money is losing value faster.  It's a bold move, but it might incentivize Bob to accept to avoid further losses on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my initial proposal, it's still not in my best interest.  My money is losing value much faster, and I can afford to wait another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise, accounting for the inflation and giving Bob a bigger share while still ensuring a significant portion for me. This could be appealing to Bob, as he might not want to risk further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my money is losing value rapidly, waiting another round will only further decrease my potential gains.  Bob's offer, while not ideal, gives me a significant portion of the money, and accepting it is the best strategy to minimize my losses at this point."
