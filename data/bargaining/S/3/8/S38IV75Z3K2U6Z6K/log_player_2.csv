"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you still get a decent piece.  Accept this, and we both win. Reject, and we both risk losing more in the future.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm feeling generous, so I'll offer you a significant portion. However, time is money, and it's in both our best interests to settle this now.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  This offer is still fair, but it reflects the changing value of the money.  Let's make this happen before we both lose more! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about the changing value of the money, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  It's better to hold out and hope for a more equitable split in the next round, even with the impact of inflation."
