Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, time is running out and Alice knows it.  We need to apply more pressure.  She's likely bluffing and hoping I panic as the rounds continue."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Look, let's just split it evenly and call it a day. This is getting ridiculous.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'even split' was a good try, but I know the money's worth less to you now 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is painful, but the rate of inflation is too high.  If this continues, Alice will be able to strong-arm me into an even worse deal in the later rounds.  It's better to cut our losses now."
