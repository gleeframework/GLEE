"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a decent amount. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept that offer. It's not fair and I'm not sure how Alice's share is a ""lion's share"" - that's a bit too much.  Let's see what kind of offer I can get."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and it's the best way to ensure we both get something.""}
