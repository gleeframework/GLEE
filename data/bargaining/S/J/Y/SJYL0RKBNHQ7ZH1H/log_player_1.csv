Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth even less. I'll think carefully...

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to get a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money.
