I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything.  This might seem unreasonable, but it's the best way to maximize my potential gains.  Since the money is losing value, I need to secure as much as possible in the first round.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more, it's unlikely Bob will offer me a better deal in the next round. The inflation means he's getting a much worse deal, and he might be tempted to take the entire amount.  Accepting this offer guarantees me at least $600,000, which is a significant sum."
