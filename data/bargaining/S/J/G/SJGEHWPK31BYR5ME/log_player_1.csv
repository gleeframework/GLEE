Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive opening move! I'm hoping to get the most out of the first round before inflation starts to hurt."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While I'm losing money with each round, I still have a chance to get a better deal in the next round. Bob is offering me very little, and I think I can get more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000} 
``` 
This is a more balanced offer. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I can get a reasonable amount of money, but also incentivize Bob to accept the offer before the next round and the inevitable further decrease in my share."
