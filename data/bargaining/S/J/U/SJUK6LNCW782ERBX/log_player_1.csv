"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair, considering we both want to get a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is tempting as it's more than I would get if I reject it now. However, the rate of inflation hurts Bob more than me. If I'm patient, I can likely get a better deal in the next round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to split it closer to even, but we need to act quickly before inflation takes more of our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is better than my last one, and the inflation is starting to become a significant factor.  Bob seems eager to make a deal. I think I can push for a slightly better split, but the risk of getting nothing is growing.
