"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping most of the money. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob is offering me $200,000, which is worth the same as it was in the first round, and he's keeping $800,000, which is worth 5% less than it was in the first round, I think this is a decent offer. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
