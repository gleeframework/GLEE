"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer favors Alice significantly. While it seems like a ""fair"" 50/50 split at first glance, the inflation heavily impacts me. It's better to wait for a more balanced offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer wasn't accounting for the inflation, which affects you far more than me.  This offer is more realistic given the circumstances. Let's close this deal and both benefit.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still deserve a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still heavily favoring herself in this deal. While she acknowledges the inflation, the offer doesn't reflect a fair adjustment considering how much faster her potential gains are diminishing. I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to be realistic. The clock is ticking, and your share is decreasing rapidly with each round. This offer is fair and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. Let's settle this now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure, but I'm not ready to give up yet. This is my revised offer, considering the current inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous. Alice is barely budging, and her offer is becoming less appealing with every passing round.  The difference between her gain and mine is still significant, and the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for both of us. I have to hold firm and hope she gets serious soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a final offer â€“ a slight compromise on my previous position.  Let's end this now before inflation eats away at any potential gains for both of us.""
