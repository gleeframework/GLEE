"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but still leaves Bob with a decent share. I want to see how he reacts to this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is less than my initial proposal, the fact that I'm losing 20% of the value of the money each round makes this a good deal. Accepting avoids the risk of further rounds and potential losses."
