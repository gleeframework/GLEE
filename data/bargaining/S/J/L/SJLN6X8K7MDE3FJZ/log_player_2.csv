Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Even split isn't good enough, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the difference is getting smaller, Alice is still trying to take advantage of the situation.  The longer we wait, the worse it gets for me. It's time to start making more serious concessions to push for a deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous considering the inflation is killing your share 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but the inflation is killing us. While not ideal, getting 44 is better than nothing, which is where we're headed if this keeps up. Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point."
