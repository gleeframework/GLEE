"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 20% and we can discuss further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a relatively generous starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but still willing to compromise. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $7,000 is now worth 90% of the original $8,000, which is $7,200, and Bob's gain of $3,000 is worth 80% of the original $2,000, which is $2,400.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
