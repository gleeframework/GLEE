"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to Round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's offer by 10%, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: 300,000 (worth 100% of its value)
Bob's gain: 700,000 (worth 90% of its value, since it's 10% less due to inflation)

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it for now. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the offer. I'd like to propose an alternative.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the current state of the game, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the advantage.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a decent balance. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're giving me a bit more, but I'm not convinced it's enough yet 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the 27.1% inflation on Bob's gain:

My gain: 400,000 (worth 100% of its value)
Bob's gain: 600,000 (worth 72.9% of its value, since it's 27.1% less due to inflation)

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not satisfied with the deal, especially since my gain is decreasing in value over time. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced this is the best deal. I'd like to propose an alternative.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the current state of the game, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, trying to find a balance between giving him a decent amount and keeping a reasonable share for myself. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
