"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive than mine, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to think carefully about it. 

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed towards my gain, but I'm hoping Bob will still accept it."
