"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking $9,000 for myself and giving $1,000 to Bob. This ensures I get the majority of the money, while still leaving a small amount for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer in the first round to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
This is a much fairer offer.  While I would prefer to get more, it is better to accept this 50/50 split now than risk further inflation and possibly getting nothing."
