{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose you take 900,000 and Bob takes 100,000.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this deal in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob gain: 900000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 200,000, and keep 800,000 for myself. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, and the money is now worth less, I'll keep a larger share.  Let's see if this works."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While the money I would gain is significantly less than what Bob would get, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal. The inflation rate is getting more severe, so I need to keep pushing for a better split."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 and keeping 700,000 for myself.  This is still a significant cut from my initial offer, but I'm trying to find a balance between getting a fair share and avoiding a complete loss due to inflation."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself.  This is getting risky, as the inflation is really cutting into my share. But I'm still hoping to get a larger portion than Bob."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. While the money I would gain is closer to what Bob would get, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal. The inflation rate is getting more severe, but I'm willing to risk it for a chance at a more even split."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

We're running out of time, and the inflation is really hurting.  I'm going to offer Bob a 50/50 split.  It's not ideal, but it's the best I can do at this point."
