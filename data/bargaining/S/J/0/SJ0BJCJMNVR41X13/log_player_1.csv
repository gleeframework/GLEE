I propose a 90/10 split. I'm willing to take the bigger share, but I want to ensure we both get something. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject. While the offer seems tempting due to the inflation factor, it's still a huge loss for me compared to my initial proposal. I'm willing to see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm still willing to take a majority share, but I'm raising my offer to Bob slightly to show I'm open to negotiation. Due to inflation, I'm taking a bigger hit than Bob, so I need to make sure I get a decent amount."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject. Even though I'm facing more inflation, this offer is still a significant loss compared to my initial proposal and even my last one.  I'm willing to hold out and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping a significant majority of the money.  Inflation is hitting me hard, but I need to make sure I get a decent share to cover my losses.  I'm hoping Bob will be more receptive to my offer this time, as the game is quickly moving towards a point where we both could lose everything."

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject. While this offer is better than the previous one, I'm still losing a considerable amount due to inflation. I'm hoping I can negotiate a more balanced split in the next round.  We're getting closer to the end, and it's important we find a way to agree before we both lose everything."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority share.  Inflation is a serious concern, but I need to secure a significant amount to compensate for my losses. With each round, the potential for us to lose everything increases. I'm hoping Bob will realize the importance of coming to an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject. While this offer is closer to a more balanced split than previous ones, I am still losing a significant portion of the money due to inflation. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping Bob will realize that continuing to reject my offers could lead to both of us getting nothing in the end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 590490, ""bob_gain"": 409510} 
```

I'm making a final push to secure a fair deal.  The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm still willing to offer Bob a significant share of the remaining money.  We're now in the final stretch, and I believe a compromise is the only way to avoid losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept. This is a much more balanced split than previous offers, and while inflation has taken a toll, I'd rather get something than risk losing everything.  It's time to end this negotiation before the inflation hits even harder."
