Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, Alice, but that first offer was way off. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""bob_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a strong offer considering the inflation we're facing.""
}
``` 

**Explanation of the offer:**

* I'm aiming for a slightly better deal than my first offer, as Bob's counter was quite low.
* The message emphasizes the time pressure and the effect of inflation to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a good deal for both of us before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but his offer is still not good enough. While the value of the money is decreasing, holding out for a better deal is crucial. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Accept it, and we both walk away with something substantial. Otherwise, we're both walking away with nothing.""
}
``` 

**Explanation of the offer:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm offering slightly less than my previous offer, creating the illusion of compromise and urgency. This might nudge Bob towards acceptance.
* **Strong Language:**  The message is firm and direct, conveying the seriousness of the situation.  
* **Ultimatum:** Presenting this as my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the potential for a lose-lose outcome if it's rejected. 
 
This offer reflects a balance between maximizing potential gain and minimizing the risk of walking away with nothing.  It's a calculated risk, but with the increasing inflation, the consequences of prolonged negotiation become more dire."
