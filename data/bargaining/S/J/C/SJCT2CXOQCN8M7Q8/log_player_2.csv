Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, this deal is getting worse for you with every round. I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it. The value of the money is going down too fast for me to risk another round."
