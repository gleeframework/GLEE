"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. I'll get 600k and you'll get 400k. Is this acceptable?""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 600k this time, and leave you with 400k.  It's a fair offer, considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to propose a slightly more advantageous split for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is not generous enough, considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a 55-45 split in my favor.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, so I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and offer a 49-51 split. This way, we both get a decent share, but I'm still getting a slight edge.""
}
```"
