Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I am not budging.  This is the fairest split.  You can continue to reject it and watch your share dwindle, but I am confident in my position. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While it's a painful decision, accepting is the best option.  The inflation is eating away at Alice's gains, and at this rate, she'll likely get nothing.  It's better to take the small amount now than risk getting nothing at all."
