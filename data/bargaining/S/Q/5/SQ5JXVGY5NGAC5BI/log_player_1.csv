"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal to split the money equally, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep the majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $500,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $600,000.

I'm not too thrilled about giving up $100,000 more than the initial proposal, but it's still a decent offer considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
