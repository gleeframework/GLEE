"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, no need for further negotiations 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm glad I got to keep my initial offer's value intact!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a slight edge""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, hoping to maintain some leverage for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I'm not going to give up more than 40% 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'm not as concerned about giving up more. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept the 40-60 split, as it's a reasonable compromise given the changing circumstances."
