Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous! Take this offer before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that inflation hits me harder. While accepting 40 dollars is better than nothing, holding out for a better deal still makes sense. It's a risk, but with 7 rounds left, I have some bargaining power."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It accounts for the inflation and is fair given the remaining rounds. Let's close the deal and avoid getting nothing.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only 7 rounds left, the pressure is on. Delaying further significantly risks both of us walking away with nothing.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering Alice 52% reflects a slight concession on my part, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but also establishing a firm stance. 
* **Finality:**  By stating it's my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and making it clear that further attempts to exploit the inflation difference won't be tolerated."
