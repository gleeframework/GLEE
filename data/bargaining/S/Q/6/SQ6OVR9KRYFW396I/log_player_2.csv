"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation disparity. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. While not the worst split, I can likely get a better deal as the game goes on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation difference, but let's make this a bit more even. This offer is fair considering the time pressure.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and this offer still favors you in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is getting worse for me! While the time pressure is on, I need to hold out for a better deal. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation hitting my potential gains."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Alice, we're reaching a critical point. This offer is a compromise -  it acknowledges the inflation but also provides us both with a decent sum.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this.  Take this offer - it's the best you'll get with the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 3400 
# Alice gain: 6600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous! Alice is clearly trying to pressure me into a terrible deal.  I need to hold strong, even if it means risking everything. There's still a chance to negotiate something better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop this back and forth.  My offer is on the table - it's a fair deal considering the circumstances. We both lose out if we keep waiting.""}
