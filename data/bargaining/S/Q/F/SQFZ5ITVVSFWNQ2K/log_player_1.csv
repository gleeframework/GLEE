"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not willing to give up that much more than I initially proposed. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,

}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much to Bob."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I think I can do better than this, and I don't want to give up too much more. I'll try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust for the inflation and get a slightly better share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to giving up, but I think we can do a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to accept it. A 50/50 split seems like a fair compromise, especially given the erosion of the money's value due to inflation. I'll take the 50% share of the remaining $10,000, which is now worth much less than the original $10,000.
