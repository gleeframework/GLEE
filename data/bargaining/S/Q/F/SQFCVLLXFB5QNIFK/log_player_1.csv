"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's see if we can find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

In this round, the $10,000 is worth 95% of its original value, so my gain of $5,000 would be worth $4,750 (5,000 * 0.95).

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
