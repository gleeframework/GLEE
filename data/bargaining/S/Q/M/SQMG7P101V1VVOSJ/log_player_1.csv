"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a small portion of the money, hoping to secure a quick agreement before inflation kicks in too much.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the 20% inflation, this offer is still better than what I would get if we continue to the next round. It's a fair split, and I'd rather take the guaranteed 500,000 than risk getting less in the next round."
