# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offers are creeping closer to a more even split.  I'm willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can secure a slightly better deal.  The next few rounds will be critical, as Alice's potential gains will dwindle significantly."
