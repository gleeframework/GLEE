"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor.  I figure this will give Bob some incentive to negotiate in the next round.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much fairer offer. I'm happy to take it!"
