"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and simple division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual amount he's offering me in terms of the original $100.

Bob is offering me $40, which is equivalent to $40 / (0.8) = $50 in the original currency. However, I can get $50 if I accept the original 50/50 split.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you less, but I think I deserve more after your previous offer""
}
```

I'm now offering a 60/40 split, trying to balance the negotiation and get a better share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not convinced I'm getting a fair share 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amount Bob is offering me in terms of the original $100.

Bob is offering me $45, which is equivalent to $45 / (0.5208) = $86.59 in the original currency.

I'll reject this offer, as I can get more than that if I accept the original 50/50 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, meet me halfway""
}
```

I'm now offering a 55/45 split, trying to find a compromise and meet Bob halfway."
