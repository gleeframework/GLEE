"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a significant portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with something. I'm aiming for a quick resolution, but I'm also willing to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a real concern. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
