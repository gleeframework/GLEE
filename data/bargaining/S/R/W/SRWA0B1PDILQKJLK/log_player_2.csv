"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40, with me getting the larger share.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the inflation, I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise to avoid losing more value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. Considering the inflation, this might be the best we can do.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise.  This offer is closer to the middle ground we both want. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the offer is closer to the middle ground, considering the inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round. Alice is losing more value than me due to inflation, so she might be more willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us both, but I know it's affecting you more. I'm willing to take a bit more, but still offer you a considerable amount. Let's settle this before the money loses more value.""}"
