"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will be so surprised by the offer that he'll accept it.  Since the money is worth less with each round, it makes sense to grab as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is clearly being greedy.  I'm not going to give up the game with a measly $1 when I know the money is worth 20% less. I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try to get as much as possible while still acknowledging Bob's position. This offer is more reasonable than my first one, but still leaves me with the majority of the money. Since he rejected my first offer, I'm going to bet that he's motivated to reach an agreement before the inflation gets too bad."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a tough choice, but the inflation is really hurting me at this point.  I'm getting much less than I wanted, but at least it's something. Bob has proven to be stubborn, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll accept the offer and move on."
