"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round."

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is a significant change from the first round, and while it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to settle for such a drastic reduction in my share this early in the game. I'll take my chances with the next round."
