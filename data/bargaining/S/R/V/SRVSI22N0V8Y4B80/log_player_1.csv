"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was being too generous, huh?

I'm not too thrilled about giving him the majority, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more... assertive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a smaller share this time, Bob""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to squeeze me, I'm not going to get squeezed 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a point about being squeezed!

Considering the inflation has reduced the value of Bob's gain, I'll think about it...

  ""decision"": ""accept""
