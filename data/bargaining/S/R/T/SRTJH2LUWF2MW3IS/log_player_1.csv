  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially since I'm the first one to make a proposal and set the tone for the negotiations.
