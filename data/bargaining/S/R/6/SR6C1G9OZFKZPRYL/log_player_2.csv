"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but generous offer. I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, it's likely we can negotiate a better deal for both of us. I'll see if I can get a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I believe a more even split is fairer and will benefit us both in the long run. Let's start with this and see if we can find common ground.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a more even split this time. I'm willing to compromise for a faster agreement. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is fair and  we both get a decent amount. It's in our best interest to agree now before inflation erodes the value of our shares even further."
