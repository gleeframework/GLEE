"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself, with a message suggesting a 60-40 split as a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected 60-40, I'll try 70-30 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Bob's offer of 300,000 for me is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is 600,000. So, in terms of the original value, I'm getting 0.9 * 600,000 = 540,000.

Bob's offer of 700,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 400,000. So, in terms of the original value, I'm giving up 0.8 * 400,000 = 320,000.

Considering the original values, I'm getting 540,000 and giving up 320,000, which is a net gain of 220,000. However, this is a 70-30 split, which is not as favorable as I'd like.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the next round, the money I gain is worth 90% of what it was in the second round, and the money Bob gains is worth 80% of what it was in the second round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 580,000, which is worth 80% of 700,000, and keeping 420,000, which is worth 90% of 300,000. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You compromised, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the next round, the money I gain is worth 72.9% of what it was in the third round, and the money Bob gains is worth 51.2% of what it was in the third round.

Let's calculate the original values of the offer:

Bob's offer of 200,000 is worth 51.2% of 580,000, so it's 0.512 * 580,000 = 296,960.

Bob's offer of 800,000 is worth 51.2% of 700,000, so it's 0.512 * 700,000 = 357,440.

Considering the original values, I'm getting 296,960 and giving up 357,440, which is a net loss of 60,480.

I'd like to reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 288000,
  ""bob_gain"": 712000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need a better deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 712,000, which is worth 51.2% of 1,400,000, and keeping 288,000, which is worth 64.1% of 450,000. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
