"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice takes into account the inflation impact on both players. Given that the money loses value at different rates for Alice and Bob (10% and 20% respectively), Alice proposes a division that slightly favors her but still offers Bob a substantial amount, hoping the fairness of the split and the looming threat of further inflation will encourage Bob to accept early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, but let's wrap this up quickly. I'm feeling generous. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlice decides to reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, she believes she can negotiate for a better split. Given that the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob, Alice is hoping to leverage this to her advantage in the next round, aiming for a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, let's settle on this before it gets worse for both of us.""}\n\nAlice adjusts her offer slightly, still favoring herself but acknowledging the urgency to settle due to the increasing impact of inflation on both parties. She aims to appeal to Bob's concern about the devaluing money, hoping this round will conclude the negotiations."
