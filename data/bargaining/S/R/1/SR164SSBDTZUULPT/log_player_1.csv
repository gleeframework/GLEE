"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. This is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less each round, I'd like to get a bit more now to compensate for the loss in value. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting my offer again.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
