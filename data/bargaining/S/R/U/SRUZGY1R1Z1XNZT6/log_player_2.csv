Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than before, it's now worth 80% of its original value, which is $8,000. I'll make a proposal that splits the remaining value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, the actual value of the money is now 64% of its original value, which is $6,400. 

Alice's offer seems reasonable, but I think I can do better.
