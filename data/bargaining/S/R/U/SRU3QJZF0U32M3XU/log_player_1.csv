"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with something.  I'm hoping he'll accept in the first round, as the inflation will only hurt me in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I proposed in round 1, even after taking inflation into account. I need to try and negotiate a better deal. I will reject this offer and propose my own in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to find a compromise soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly worse, despite the inflation. I'm still holding out for a better deal, as the remaining rounds are quickly diminishing the value of the money.  I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm making another compromise, offering Bob a larger share than in the previous round.  Inflation is starting to hurt me, so I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement before the money becomes essentially worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to find a solution that gives me a better share.  I'm going to make another counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're down to the wire, and the inflation is making things difficult.  I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equitable solution in this situation.  With so few rounds left, I hope he'll accept this offer before the money is completely devalued."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable. The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and I need to ensure I get a fair share. I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a slight majority in this round. The inflation is taking a heavy toll, and I need to secure some of the money before it's too late. Hopefully, this offer will be enough to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While I'm running out of time, Bob's offer is still not good enough.  The value of the money is decreasing drastically, and I'm hoping to get a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000} 
```

We're down to the last few rounds. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to secure a deal before the value of the money drops too significantly.  This is my final offer, and I'm willing to accept a 40/60 split at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Unfortunately, with only one round remaining, the value of the money has significantly decreased. Even though Bob's offer is not ideal, it's better than getting nothing.  Accepting this offer ensures I get some money rather than losing everything to inflation."
