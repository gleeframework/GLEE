"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the total amount. I'm keeping the remaining 90% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end the game 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious.

However, Bob's offer to meet me halfway is a reasonable one. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
