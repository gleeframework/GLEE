# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an interesting offer from Bob. He's trying to take a larger share of the money. I'll think about it for a moment...

}

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which should give me a slightly larger share of the money."

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $200,000. That's a very low amount, and I think I can do better than that. I'll try to negotiate for a more reasonable offer."

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
