"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 20 dollars is worth even less than before, and Bob's gain of 80 dollars is worth even more less.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, let's try again!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more reasonable and give Bob a larger share, hoping he'll accept this offer."
