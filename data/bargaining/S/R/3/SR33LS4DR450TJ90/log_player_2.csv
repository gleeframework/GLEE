"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 20% inflation rate for me is a significant concern, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get more than 40%."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a fair split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 55%, and you can have 45%. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gain (36% less) and Alice's relatively minor loss (9.75% less), I think accepting this offer is the best decision. Meeting in the middle seems fair, and I don't want to risk losing more value in future rounds."
