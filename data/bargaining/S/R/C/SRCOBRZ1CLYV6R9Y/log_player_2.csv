Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This is the last round where my offer is better than your previous one.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think this is a good deal considering the inflation and the fact that Alice's offer is better than my previous one. It's time to settle and get the money before it loses more value!"
