"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob. I think this is a reasonable split, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $2700.

I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
