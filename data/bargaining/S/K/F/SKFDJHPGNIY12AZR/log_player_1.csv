Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it quickly.  I'll try to maximize my gains before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a higher share, accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a significant amount of money.  The inflation is starting to bite, and it's likely things will get worse in the future.  It's better to secure a decent gain now than risk losing more in subsequent rounds."
