Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with Bob getting a 2% advantage (51-49) in this round, especially since I don't know how the inflation will affect him in future rounds. I'll try to negotiate a better deal or wait for a better offer."
