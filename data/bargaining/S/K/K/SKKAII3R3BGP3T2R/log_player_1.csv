"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the value of the money has decreased. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I deserve more than 400k, considering the initial amount was $1,000,000. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not satisfied with the split 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less. I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk waiting for a better offer and potentially getting nothing."
