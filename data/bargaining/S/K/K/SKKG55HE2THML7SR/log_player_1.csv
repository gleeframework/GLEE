Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  We both benefit from closing the deal now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Even with the inflation working against him, Bob is still pushing for an even split. This implies I can likely secure a better deal as time goes on.  I'll reject and propose something more advantageous in the next round."

**Reasoning:**

* **Repeating a Strong Offer:** I'm sticking with my initial offer of 6000/4000. This might seem stubborn, but it emphasizes that I'm serious and value my position.
* **Time Pressure:** By highlighting that time is running out, I increase the pressure on Bob. The longer he waits, the less appealing any offer becomes due to inflation. 
* **Maintaining a ""Fair"" Facade:** While the deal is increasingly beneficial to me over time, I'm framing it as a consistently fair offer. This might make it more palatable for Bob to accept."
