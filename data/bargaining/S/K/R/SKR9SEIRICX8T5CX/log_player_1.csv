"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'll start by being generous and giving Bob 10% of the money.  Let's see if he's happy with that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm willing to go down to 800k for myself, but I think Bob should be happy with 200k.  It's still a decent chunk of change, and if we don't agree, the inflation will keep eating away at the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still willing to give Bob a good amount, but the inflation is starting to worry me.  I'm going down to 700k for myself, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in taking 300k before we lose even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out.  Even though the inflation is eating away at the value, I think I can get a better deal than this.  If we don't agree, I'll make another offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm getting a bit nervous with the inflation. I'm offering 600,000 to myself, which I think is a fair compromise.  I hope Bob sees that and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this offer, but I'm starting to get nervous about running out of time. I'll make a counter-offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split now.  We're running out of time, and I think it's the fairest way to divide the money.  It's time to compromise!"
