"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take most of the money now, but if you reject this, it's only going to get worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While Alice is trying to use fear tactics, there's plenty of time to negotiate a fairer deal.  We'll see who's singing a different tune in a few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. Let's start with a more reasonable split. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share. If you keep rejecting my offers, there's a real chance we'll both end up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting closer, but it's still not a great deal. She's clearly feeling the pressure, and we can use that to our advantage.  Let's see if she comes up a bit more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's meet in the middle. This is my final offer.""}
