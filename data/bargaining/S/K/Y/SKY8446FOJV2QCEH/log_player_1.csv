"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I now have to consider that my gain of 40% of the original 100$ is actually worth 36% of the original amount (due to 20% less). Bob's gain of 60% is worth 54% of the original amount (due to 10% less).

I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting less than I initially proposed in Round 1. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the devaluation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual value of the offer, I need to account for the inflation effects. Since my gain of 50% is worth 51.2% of the original amount (100% - 48.8% less), and Bob's gain of 50% is worth 72.9% of the original amount (100% - 27.1% less).

I'll accept this offer since I'd be getting a higher percentage of the original amount than I initially proposed in Round 1. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
