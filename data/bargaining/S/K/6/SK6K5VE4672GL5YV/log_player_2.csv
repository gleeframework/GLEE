"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I think 70/30 is a good split considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal. With 11 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to potentially get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 45/55 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but 55 is still too low for me. I'm proposing 65/35. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the inflation is taking its toll, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. With 9 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk to try and get a larger share. Alice's offer of 65/35 is still not acceptable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I understand we're both trying to get the best deal, but considering the inflation, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest. It's a compromise that allows us to both walk away with something substantial, and I'm willing to settle for this to avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this one. 60/40 is my final offer.  The inflation is eating into your potential gains with every round we waste.  Let's be reasonable and finalize this. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not convinced that Alice's offer of 60/40 is her ""final offer"". With 7 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try and negotiate a better deal. I believe Alice may be willing to compromise further, and I'm not ready to settle for 40% just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I understand the pressure of inflation, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer to Alice, but I still believe a fair compromise is possible. 52/48 is my new proposal, considering the decreasing value of the money for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous.  58/42 is my final offer.  Every round that passes is costing you significantly more than it's costing me. Take the deal while you still have something substantial to gain! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer of 58/42. With 5 rounds left, the risk of further devaluation is too high, and I'm willing to settle for 42% rather than potentially ending up with a much smaller share or even nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
