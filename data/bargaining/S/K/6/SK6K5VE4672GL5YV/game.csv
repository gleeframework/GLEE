70.0,30.0,"Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I think 70/30 is a good split considering the inflation working against you.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,"Considering the inflation, I think a 45/55 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid further devaluation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but 55 is still too low for me. I'm proposing 65/35. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"I understand we're both trying to get the best deal, but considering the inflation, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest. It's a compromise that allows us to both walk away with something substantial, and I'm willing to settle for this to avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this one. 60/40 is my final offer.  The inflation is eating into your potential gains with every round we waste.  Let's be reasonable and finalize this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
48.0,52.0,"I understand the pressure of inflation, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer to Alice, but I still believe a fair compromise is possible. 52/48 is my new proposal, considering the decreasing value of the money for me.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous.  58/42 is my final offer.  Every round that passes is costing you significantly more than it's costing me. Take the deal while you still have something substantial to gain!",Alice,7,
