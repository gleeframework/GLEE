I propose that I get 90 dollars, and Bob gets 10 dollars.  This way, I get the majority of the money, and Bob still gets something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than what he offered me in the first round, I'm not willing to settle for 40% of the money yet.  I believe I can still get a better deal if I push through a few more rounds.  Inflation will hurt Bob more than it hurts me, so he'll likely offer me a better deal to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to 60 dollars, while still leaving Bob with 40 dollars. This way, we both get a decent amount, and it's still a better deal for me than what Bob offered.  Let's see if he accepts this time."
