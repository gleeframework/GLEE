"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we split it evenly. This way, both of us can adjust our spending accordingly. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in splitting it evenly just yet. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for the majority. Don't want to be left with scraps!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 65% of the $100, and Bob gets 35%."
