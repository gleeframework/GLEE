Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since Alice rejected my initial offer, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money's value, my gain of 40 is actually worth 9.75% less than my initial 25, so it's equivalent to about 22.62. Alice's gain of 60 is worth 36% less than her initial 75, so it's equivalent to about 48.6.

Considering this, I'll accept Alice's offer from round 3.
