"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, considering that the money loses value with each passing round, and I want to incentivize Bob to accept the offer sooner rather than later. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the money is losing value with each passing round, accepting a 40-60 split in Bob's favor would put me at a disadvantage. Since the money loses value at a slower rate for me (5% per round) compared to Bob (20% per round), I can afford to wait and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Additionally, Bob's message suggests that they are willing to compromise, so I'll try to take advantage of that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a 58-42 split in my favor, which is a slight concession from my initial offer. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's willingness to compromise, as mentioned in their previous message. By offering a slightly more favorable split, I'm trying to entice Bob to accept the offer and avoid further devaluation of the money."
