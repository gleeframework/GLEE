20.0,80.0,"You wanted a 60/40 split, but I think I can do better than that. How about 80/20?",Bob,2,

54.0,46.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 80/20 is too much.  Let's try 54/46. This keeps things closer to a fair split, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"I'm still not convinced 54/46 is the best we can do. How about 55/45? It's a small concession from my previous offer, but I think it's worth it to get a better deal.",Bob,4,
