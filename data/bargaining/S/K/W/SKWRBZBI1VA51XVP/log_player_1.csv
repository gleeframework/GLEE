"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can make this a bit more even. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
This offer significantly favors Bob, especially with inflation cutting into my potential gains. I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such a disadvantaged position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer in round 1 was more than fair. Let's be reasonable and find a compromise. Time is literally money for me in this deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway. This offer is a fair compromise considering the time constraint. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is now slightly better than my initial offer would be after another round of inflation. It's frustrating that he's been so stubborn, but accepting now is the most logical choice to maximize my gains."
