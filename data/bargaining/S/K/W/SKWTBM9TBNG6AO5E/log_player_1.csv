"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and take $6000 for myself, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. This seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering your higher inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, accepting $4500 now would mean I lose a significant portion of the original value. I'll make a new offer in the next round to try and find a better compromise.\n\n###\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, considering our inflation rates""}\n\n###\nI'll propose a division where I get $5250 and Bob gets $4750. This is closer to the middle ground, taking into account the higher inflation rate affecting my portion. I'll try to persuade Bob that this is a fair compromise, given the circumstances.\n\n###\nLet's see how Bob responds!"
