"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In the first round, I would have gained $600,000, which is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's worth $570,000.

Bob's offer is $300,000, which is 42.5% of the original $1,000,000, and it's worth 100% of its original value.

Considering the inflation, I think I'm better off rejecting this offer and waiting for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll make an offer that takes this into account. I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I get 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is worth 95% of the original amount."
