"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob, considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a good deal for Bob in the first round, as he gets to keep 75% of the money. The decreasing value of the money in subsequent rounds makes accepting a good idea, even if Bob is a little greedy."
