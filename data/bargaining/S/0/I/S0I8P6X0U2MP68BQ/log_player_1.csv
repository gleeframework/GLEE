"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take the rest. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. You can't expect me to give you 400k and take only 200k myself! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share as I was in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, Bob. I'll keep pushing for a better deal.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger toll on my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take 550k, and you can have the rest. It's still a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much more. You're getting a better deal than I am, and I'm not sure it's fair. I'll give you a small share, but I'm keeping most of the money. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. With my gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. However, I still don't want to accept a lopsided split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not happy with the 1-9 split, Bob. I'm starting to think I should just wait for the next round and hope the inflation works in my favor.""
}
```

I'll hold out for a better deal, but I'm getting worried that the inflation might make it harder for me to get a fair share."
