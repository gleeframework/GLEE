"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and it's a fair starting point for the negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk too. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

My gain of $2000 is worth 90% of $2000, which is $1800, and Bob's gain of $8000 is worth 80% of $8000, which is $6400.

Considering the reduced values, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, so my gain will be worth 81% of my previous gain, and Bob's gain will be worth 64% of his previous gain.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a larger share this time, but I still think 75% is a bit steep.""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be more appealing to Bob. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'll give you a tiny bit too. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains considering the inflation:

My gain of $1000 is worth 72.9% of the original $10,000, which is $729. My gain is worth 7.29% of the original amount. Bob's gain of $9000 is worth 52.2% of the original $10,000, which is $5220. Bob's gain is worth 52.2% of the original amount.

Considering the reduced values, I'm not thrilled about this offer. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, so my gain will be worth 72.9% of my previous gain, and Bob's gain will be worth 51.2% of his previous gain.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 75% is too high. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to find a compromise that might be more appealing to Bob. Your turn!"
