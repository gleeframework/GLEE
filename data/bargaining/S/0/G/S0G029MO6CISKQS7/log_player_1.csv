"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original 100$ (40$) and keeping 60% for myself (60$). Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 60% 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take the majority of the cake!

Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* Bob's gain: 60% of 100$ is 60$, but due to inflation, it's now worth 60 * 0.95 = 57$
* Alice's gain: 40% of 100$ is 40$, but due to inflation, it's now worth 40 * 0.95 = 38$

Considering the reduced value, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was too generous for him, I'll try to make a more reasonable proposal this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the original 100$ (45$) and keeping 55% for myself (55$). Let's see if Bob accepts this more moderate proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, but I'll take the higher half 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to stick to the idea of meeting in the middle, but with a slight bias towards himself.

Since the money is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* Alice's gain: 45% of 100$ is 45$, but due to inflation, it's now worth 45 * 0.8574 = 38.66$
* Bob's gain: 55% of 100$ is 55$, but due to inflation, it's now worth 55 * 0.8574 = 47.19$

Considering the reduced value, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
