Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  60/40 is a much more equitable split. I'm willing to compromise, but if you reject this, I'll be taking a larger share next time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
