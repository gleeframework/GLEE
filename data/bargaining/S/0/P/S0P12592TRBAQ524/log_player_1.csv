"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a 99.9% share for myself and 0.1% for Bob. I am taking a large share knowing that the value of the money will decrease with each round. However, I am offering Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept, rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, accepting Bob's offer is the best option for me.  The money is already worth less due to inflation, and if I reject, I risk getting nothing in later rounds. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
