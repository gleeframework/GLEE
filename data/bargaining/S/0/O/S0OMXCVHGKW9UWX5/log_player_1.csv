"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split. Let's divide it 51/49. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can move on to other things. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
