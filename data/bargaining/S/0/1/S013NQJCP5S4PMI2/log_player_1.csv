I'm going to try and get the most money possible, but I'm also willing to share a little bit with Bob. This will hopefully get the game over quickly and I'll still get a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, taking a 50/50 split is still a good outcome given the inflation.  I'm not sure how much longer the game will go on, and the money will keep losing value for me. It's better to secure a decent amount now."
