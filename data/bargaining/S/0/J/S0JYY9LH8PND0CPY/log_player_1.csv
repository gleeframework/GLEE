"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are rising!

I'll have to think carefully before making a decision. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a slightly larger share. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
