"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:\n\n

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. It's a good deal for both of us!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a reasonable and generous offer, considering that I'm the one making the first proposal. I'm also trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness with my message. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60-40 split this time.  It's a fair deal, considering the money loses value each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think so! Considering the inflation only affects Bob's gain, I think I can get a better deal. Here's my response:


```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can negotiate for a larger share of the money. Since the inflation doesn't affect my gain, I'm in a stronger position to bargain. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:


```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is affecting your gain, I think 65-35 is a more reasonable split now. Take it before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 65% and decreasing Bob's share to 35%. Since the inflation is only affecting Bob's gain, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and encouraging him to accept the offer before the money loses even more value for him. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to 70-30 to make this deal happen.  It's a good offer for both of us, especially considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","No way! Bob's offer is still not good enough for me. Since the inflation only affects his gain, I can keep pushing for a better deal. Here's my response:


```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get an even better deal. With the inflation reducing the value of Bob's gain, I'm in an even stronger position to negotiate. I'll make another offer that's more favorable to me. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:


```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation has reduced the value of your gain significantly, I think 70-30 is a generous offer. Take it before the money becomes worthless for you!""
}
```

I'm now offering Bob 30% of the original amount, which is actually worth much less to him due to the inflation. I'm emphasizing the fact that the inflation has reduced the value of his gain significantly, and trying to create a sense of urgency to accept the offer. Let's see if Bob will finally accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 80-20.  With the inflation, we both need to be realistic about what's achievable, and this is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still not in my favor. Even with the inflation, I'm not willing to accept only 20% of the original amount. I'll keep pushing for a better deal, as the inflation only affects Bob's gain. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""Come on, Bob! With the inflation eating away at your share, it's time to be realistic. 75-25 is a more than fair offer at this point.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 75% and offering Bob 25% of the original amount. Given the significant reduction in value of Bob's gain due to inflation, I believe this is a reasonable offer. I'm trying to emphasize the reality of the situation and encourage Bob to accept the deal. Let's see how he responds!"
