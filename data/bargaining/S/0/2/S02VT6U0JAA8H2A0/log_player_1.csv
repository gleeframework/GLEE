"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and we have plenty of rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's start with an equal split! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so if I were to accept Bob's offer, I would actually get $40 ($50 * 0.8) and Bob would get $40.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an equal split just yet, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll propose a new offer that takes into account the decreased value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which is a more modest increase from my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! 

With the 48.8% decrease, if I were to accept Bob's offer, I would actually get $20.80 ($40 * 0.52) and Bob would get $60.20.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit and the decreasing value of the money. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can do better in future rounds.
