# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something, it's not a fair division, and I can likely do better by holding out for a more equitable split."

# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still significantly unfair.  I'm going to keep rejecting these offers and hope for a more balanced split."

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too one-sided.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with significantly less than half of the money."

# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a fairer split, I'm still going to reject it. I'm willing to risk a little more to see if we can reach a more equitable solution before the time runs out."
