"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but leaves Bob with something to consider. I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, but I'm still not happy with a 50/50 split.  The inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, so I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm also aware of the increasing pressure of inflation. This offer compromises slightly but still leaves me with the majority and hopefully is appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is starting to look more appealing due to the increasing inflation, I'm still not willing to settle for less than 40% of the original amount. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

The inflation is hitting hard now, but I'm still trying to hold out for a decent share. This offer is a compromise, but it keeps me above the 50% mark. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in taking a deal while the money is still worth something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is starting to get very close to my bottom line. I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm still not willing to accept a deal that gives me less than 30% of the original amount.  I'm going to try one more time to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm trying to stay optimistic. With the inflation hitting me so hard, I'm willing to lower my demand slightly. This offer still gives me a decent share, but I'm also aware that it's likely my last chance to make a proposal. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value in accepting this offer and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a very small amount, it's better than nothing. The inflation has taken a huge bite out of the money's value for me, and I'm afraid that if I reject this offer, we will both end up with nothing. I'm accepting this offer to secure at least a small amount of money before it's worth even less."
