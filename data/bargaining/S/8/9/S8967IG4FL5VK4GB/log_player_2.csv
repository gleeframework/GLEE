"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what happens if I push for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  This is a fair starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm aiming for a fair deal.  Time is ticking, and the value decreases with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's not a terrible deal considering the circumstances."
