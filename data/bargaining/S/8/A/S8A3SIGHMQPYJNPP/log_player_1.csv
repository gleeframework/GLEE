"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original 100$ and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Consider this offer. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round, the effective values are:

* My original 80$ is now worth 64$
* Bob's original 20$ is now worth 16$

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have 60$ (worth 48$ in the original amount) and Bob will have 40$ (worth 32$ in the original amount).

I'll accept this offer.
