Alice's offer:

It's worth seeing what Alice will offer in the next round.  There's a good chance she'll offer me more to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Alice a 40% share. This is a fair starting point, considering inflation will impact her offer in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is less appealing than my initial offer, but inflation is a serious factor. Taking a smaller share now is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
