"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let us divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $45, which is a relatively fair offer considering the inflation penalty he'll incur if he rejects it. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer. If he rejects it, the next offer will be made by him, and I'll have to decide whether to accept it or not. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, and considering that Bob's gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer.\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince Bob's gain is worth 5% less in each round, I'll try to take advantage of this and offer him a slightly lower amount than before, while still being relatively fair. Here's my offer:\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal for you""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Bob accepts this offer or decides to reject it and make a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slight hit to avoid further inflation. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering that the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, and given that Bob's gain is now worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I think I have the upper hand in negotiations. Bob's offer of 49 for me and 51 for him doesn't seem favorable to me, especially since his gain is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nGiven that Bob's gain is now worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I'll try to make an offer that takes this into account. Since I have the upper hand in negotiations, I'll offer Bob a slightly lower amount than before, while still trying to be somewhat fair. Here's my offer:\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the significant inflation, this is a reasonable deal""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Bob accepts this offer or decides to reject it and make a counteroffer!"
