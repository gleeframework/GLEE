Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $9,000 and Bob getting $1,000.  I think this is a fair starting point, as it's a significant offer for Bob, and I get the majority of the money. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better than risking getting nothing if I reject and he decides to take the entire $10,000 in the next round."
