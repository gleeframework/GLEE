"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, which is a relatively fair starting point, considering the inflation factor that will kick in later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, Bob's offer is actually a good one for me. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
