"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I think a 60/40 split is reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""I understand you wanting the larger share, but that split isn't fair for me. I propose a 48/52 split instead. Let's settle this quickly.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The money loses value rapidly for me (Bob). A quick resolution is crucial.
* **Fairness Appeal:** While I want a better deal than Alice's initial offer, I'm proposing a split that is still slightly in her favor, making it more likely she'll accept. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes a desire for a swift agreement."
