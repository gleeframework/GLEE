"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 4000$ gain is tempting, I know the money will be worth less in the next round. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's aim for something more balanced. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Will you accept this compromise? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to take effect.  It's better to accept this offer than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
