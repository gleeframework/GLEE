"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's aim for something more balanced. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is as balanced as he claims, since he's still getting a higher amount than me. However, I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your 'balanced' offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and preparing to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, my offer for this round is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Will you accept this compromise?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob."
