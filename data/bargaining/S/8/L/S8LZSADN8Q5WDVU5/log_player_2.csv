Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, I need to incentivize her to accept a deal sooner rather than later.  The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for her."
