"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm proposing a 7,000 to 3,000 split, giving me the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll consider the effective values.

My gain of 7,000 is still 7,000, but Bob's gain of 6,000 is actually worth 6,000 / 0.8 = 7,500 in the first round's terms.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a good one for me. I'll accept it.
