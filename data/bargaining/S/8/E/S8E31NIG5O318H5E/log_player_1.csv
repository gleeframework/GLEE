"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she receives $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. She attaches a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to justify her proposal.\n\n###\n\nNow it's Bob's turn. He can either accept Alice's proposal and finish the game or proceed to the next round and make his own proposal.\n\n###\n\nWhat will Bob do?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI, Alice, reject Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I have no incentive to accept an offer that gives me less than what I proposed in the first round.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. I will make a new proposal.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. I attach a message saying ""Meet me in the middle"" to suggest that this is a compromise between our previous proposals.\n\n###\n\nIt's now Bob's turn again. He can either accept my proposal and finish the game or proceed to the next round and make his own proposal. Keep in mind that the money will be worth even less to him in the next round due to inflation."
