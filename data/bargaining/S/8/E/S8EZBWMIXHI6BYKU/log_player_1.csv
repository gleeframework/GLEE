I'm starting with a fairly even split, but I'm leaning slightly towards myself since I'm the first to propose and know the value of money will decrease faster for Bob.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation is starting to bite.  Accepting this offer means I still get a decent amount, and Bob's offer is already more favorable to him than my first proposal.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round."
