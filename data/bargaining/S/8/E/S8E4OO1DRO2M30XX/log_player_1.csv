"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start! Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to rush 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $50 is worth the same amount, but I'm willing to meet in the middle.
