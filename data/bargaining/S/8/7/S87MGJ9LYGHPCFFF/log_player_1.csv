"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

I'll think about Bob's offer... Hmm, it's a bit more in his favor than mine, but I'll consider it. I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time for my next proposal!

Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the $100, and Bob gets the remaining 45%."
