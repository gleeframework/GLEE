Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor. Since the money devalues more for Bob than for me, I want to maximize my gains early on. Let's see if he accepts this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less now, Bob's offer still gives me a significant amount of money. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the next round."
