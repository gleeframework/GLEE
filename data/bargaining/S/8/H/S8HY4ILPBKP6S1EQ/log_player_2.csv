Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to be more reasonable. This offer is still in my favor, but it's closer to a fair split.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
While Alice is moving in the right direction, that's still a very large difference, especially with inflation eating into my share more with every round. I need to incentivize her to be fairer quicker."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the clock is ticking faster for me. This offer is more than fair and gives us both a good deal considering the shrinking pot.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be practical - this is a 50/50 split. It's fair and the best we can do now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally being realistic!  A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome at this point, especially considering the ongoing effects of inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees I get a reasonable share, whereas continuing to negotiate could lead to a worse outcome for both of us."
