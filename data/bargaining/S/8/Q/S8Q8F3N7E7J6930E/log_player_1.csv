"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. This seems like a fair starting point, as it's a significant amount for both of us, and we haven't yet had to deal with the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation factor is starting to kick in, and accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount without risking further losses."
