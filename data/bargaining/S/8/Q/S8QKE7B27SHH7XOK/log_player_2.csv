"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money. I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept that offer. I know the money is worth less with each round, but I'm hoping to get a better deal than 40 dollars.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation will affect your share more than mine. Let's make a deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. Let's compromise - this offer is fair for both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would still prefer a slightly higher share, I don't think I'll get a better deal than this. The inflation is starting to hurt, and Alice is likely to offer less in the next round."
