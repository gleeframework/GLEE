Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  This offer is fair, and we can move on to bigger and better things. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's analyze Bob's offer. While he presents it as fair, it heavily favors him, especially with the inflation working against me more than him.  I need to counter with a stronger offer to get a better deal."

# Bob gain: 5500

Bob is getting bolder! He knows time is on his side, but I'm not accepting an offer where I lose more due to inflation. I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't be pushed around."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing out here.  This offer is a fair compromise, and it's time to end this game before we both lose even more. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}

This is a tough one, but it's time to be realistic.  

Bob has countered my offer and is holding firm at a slightly advantageous split. While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is eating away at the value significantly. Accepting this offer ensures I at least get something substantial, whereas continuing the game risks getting even less as the rounds progress."
