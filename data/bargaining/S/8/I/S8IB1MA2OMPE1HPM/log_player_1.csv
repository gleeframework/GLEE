"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to secure a large portion of the money.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this deal to avoid potential losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I prefer a larger share, the inflation factor makes accepting Bob's offer the most sensible choice. Holding out for a better deal could lead to even smaller gains for me in future rounds."
