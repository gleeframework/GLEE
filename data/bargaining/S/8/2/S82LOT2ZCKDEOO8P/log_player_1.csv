Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I want to keep most of the money, but I figure Bob might just accept it to see how the game works. We'll see!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll take it!  Even with the 20% inflation, getting $50 is better than risking getting nothing if Bob rejects my next offer."
