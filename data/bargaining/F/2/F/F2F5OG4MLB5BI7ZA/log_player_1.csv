"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I think 40 is a relatively good offer for me. I'd rather accept this offer than risk going to the next round and potentially getting a worse deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
