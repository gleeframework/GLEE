"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. I get a little more since the money loses value for me over time. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me over time, but does for Alice, I can try to negotiate for a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the money loses value for Alice over time, I can try to negotiate for a better split in this round. I will offer a division that gives me a bit more than half, but not so much that Alice will reject it outright.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Considering your loss, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Alice will accept this offer or try to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm losing money every round, a 50/50 split is the only fair outcome now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, her argument about a 50/50 split being fair due to her losses doesn't hold up from my perspective. Given that the value of the money remains constant for me, I can continue to negotiate for a better deal, especially since Alice is under pressure from the devaluing of her potential gains over time.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given that Alice is under increasing pressure from the devaluing of her potential gains and I have the advantage of the money not losing value for me, I'll make an offer that is slightly more favorable to me than the previous one. However, I need to balance this with the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and the game continuing, potentially leading to further losses for her but also a risk of not reaching an agreement. I will offer a division that still gives me more than half but acknowledges Alice's growing urgency.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering the situation, this is a generous offer""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Alice will accept this offer or decide to continue negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. It accounts for the time pressure, but also recognizes that you're getting the better end of the deal. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the current situation and the fact that Alice is under significant pressure from the devaluing of her potential gains, I'll consider her offer carefully. Alice's offer of a 55/45 split in my favor is more favorable to me than her previous offers, and it shows that she is willing to compromise. Considering that I have the upper hand due to the money not losing value for me, I can continue to negotiate. However, there's also a risk that if I push too hard, Alice might decide to continue the game, hoping I'll make a mistake or become impatient. Given the current offer and the dynamics of the game, I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate an even better deal in the next round, keeping in mind that Alice's losses due to inflation are significant and she may be more inclined to accept a slightly less favorable deal to end the game sooner.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer and continue the negotiations, aiming for a slightly better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the significant pressure Alice is under due to the devaluing of her potential gains (now worth 34.39% less than in the first round) and considering she has shown a willingness to compromise with her last offer, I will make an offer that still favors me but is slightly more generous than my previous one. I aim to strike a balance between maximizing my gain and the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and continuing the game. Since Alice has already offered a 55/45 split in my favor, I will offer a division that is slightly better for her than my last proposal but still more favorable to me than her last offer.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 625000, ""alice_gain"": 375000, ""message"": ""This is a compromise, considering your situation""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Alice will accept this offer, given the increasing urgency due to the devaluing of her potential gains over time."
