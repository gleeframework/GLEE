"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering your loss, this is more than fair 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm losing money every round, a 50/50 split is the only fair outcome now.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the situation, this is a generous offer 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While this offer is getting worse, I need to hold strong. Bob knows I lose money every round and is trying to pressure me.  I'll take the hit on another round of inflation to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise. It accounts for the time pressure, but also recognizes that you're getting the better end of the deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly aiming to exploit the inflation.  I need to make a concession to avoid getting even worse offers. This offer is still better than what Bob offered in round 4, and acknowledges the reality of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a compromise, considering your situation 
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to offer anything better. Accepting this offer avoids further losses due to inflation.  While not ideal, it's better to secure something than risk getting even less in later rounds."
