"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly. I want to see if Bob is willing to take a smaller share, or if he'll try to negotiate for more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice.  With inflation, my share in the next round would be worth even less.  This offer guarantees me at least half of the original value of the money, which is a better outcome than risking further loss."
