"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you""}\n\nI'm offering a split where I take $5500 and Bob takes $4500. Given the inflation rates, where the money is worth 5% less for me but 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, this initial offer seems reasonable and slightly favorable to Bob, considering the steep depreciation of the money's value for him. It encourages a quick resolution that benefits both parties, especially Bob, before the value drops significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his claim, the inflation actually affects him more significantly than me. Given the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, his urgency to settle should be greater than mine. His offer does not reflect the true impact of inflation on our respective gains, making it less favorable for me than it should be considering the circumstances."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your end, this is a generous offer""}\n\nGiven the progression of the game and the impact of inflation, where the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob, my new offer reflects this dynamic. By proposing that I take $5800 and Bob takes $4200, I'm still offering a relatively fair deal that takes into account the growing urgency for Bob due to the higher depreciation rate of the money's value on his side. This offer encourages a settlement before the value drops even further for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the final offer. I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid further inflation impacts. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accept Bob's offer because, despite the initial appearance that I'm getting less than Bob, the impact of inflation significantly reduces the real value of the money he receives. Given that the money is now worth 48.8% less for Bob than in the first round, his share of $5200 is actually worth much less in real terms. Meanwhile, my share of $4800, being worth only 14.26% less for me, retains more of its original value. This offer is more favorable to me than it seems at first glance, making it a good deal considering the circumstances."
