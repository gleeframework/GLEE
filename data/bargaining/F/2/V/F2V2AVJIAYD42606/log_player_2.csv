Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go now, considering the inflation. We can both get a decent amount, and it avoids further back and forth. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
