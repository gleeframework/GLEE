"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  I figure that since I'm the one making the offer in the first round, I'll try to get as much as possible. I know the money will lose value, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting nothing in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, it's likely that Bob will make progressively less generous offers in future rounds.  Given the inflation, and that Bob's offer is already quite generous, it's in my best interest to accept."
