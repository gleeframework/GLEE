"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I propose a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer gives Alice a significantly larger share, and considering the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a decent share, and it's more balanced.""}\n\nI've taken into account the inflation and tried to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. Let's see how Alice responds!"
