"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep most of the money 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me, I need to be more cautious. Bob is offering a 30/70 split, which is still quite lopsided. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% less for me due to inflation. I'll try to propose a more favorable split for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I need a fairer split""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less for me now. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. A 35/65 split is still not ideal, but it's better than the previous offer. I'll accept this offer, as I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.
