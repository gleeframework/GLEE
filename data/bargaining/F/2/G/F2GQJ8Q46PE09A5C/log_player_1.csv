"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer gives me a large share (9000) and leaves Bob with a smaller share (1000). It's a risky strategy, but I believe it's best to maximize my gains early on.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is significantly less than my initial proposal.  Since I am not losing any value due to inflation in this round, I can afford to reject and see what Bob offers in the next round."

```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable due to inflation, and this round it's very close to a 30/70 split.
