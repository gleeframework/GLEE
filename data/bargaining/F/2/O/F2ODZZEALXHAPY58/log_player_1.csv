"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a very risky move, but I'm going for a big chunk of the money. I'm betting that Bob will see it's better to take a small share now than risk getting nothing in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my offer from round 1, even after accounting for inflation. I'm still hoping to get a larger share. I'll reject his offer and make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I still believe that it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer. I'm hoping that he realizes that continuing to reject offers could lead to both of us getting nothing in the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my offer from round 3, even after accounting for inflation. I believe that I can still get a better deal, especially since the time is running out. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a majority of the money. I'm aware of the inflation, but I think I can still secure a decent share. If Bob rejects this, I'll be forced to make more concessions in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my offer from round 5, even after accounting for inflation. The time is running out, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I will reject his offer and try to secure a larger share in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm making a significant concession this round.  Inflation is hitting hard, and I need to secure something before we both risk getting nothing.  This is a fair split considering the circumstances, and I hope Bob recognizes that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to being fair, it's still worse for me than my offer from round 7 after accounting for inflation.  I'm hoping to get a slightly larger share in the next round, as time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even split this round. The inflation has hit both of us hard, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing with each passing round. It's time for a compromise, and I believe this is a fair solution."
