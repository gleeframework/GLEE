# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not sure if he's taking into account the inflation factor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $500,000. I want to try to negotiate a better deal!"
