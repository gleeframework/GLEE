"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it wasn't quite fair. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. Let's avoid further inflation and settle this now.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is eating away at this deal. My last offer was much fairer. Let's settle this before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to use the threat of inflation to pressure me into accepting a bad deal. While her offer is slightly better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to hold strong and demonstrate I'm willing to risk it for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. This offer considers the impact of inflation on your share.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:**  I'm slightly decreasing my demand from Round 2 to show a willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for a significantly fairer split than what Alice has offered.
* **Acknowledging inflation:** By mentioning the impact of inflation on Alice's share, I'm reminding her that time is a factor and pushing for a quicker resolution.
* **Firm but fair:**  The tone remains respectful but firm, conveying that I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a quarter of a million dollars!  Don't be greedy, accept this deal before inflation makes it even less appealing. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is improving, and the pressure of inflation is mounting, accepting this deal would still give her a significantly larger share.  We are past the halfway point in the negotiations, and I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a more equitable split.  It's a calculated risk, but I believe holding out for a better offer is still the stronger move."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering a 60/40 split. This factors in the inflation working against you and allows us both to walk away with a sizable sum. Time is running out to make a sensible deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down slightly from my previous 65/35 offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but still holding onto a larger share.
* **Highlighting Urgency:** I'm emphasizing that time is not on Alice's side due to inflation, increasing the pressure on her to accept a less favorable split.
* **Appealing to Logic:**  By framing the offer as ""realistic"" and ""sensible,"" I'm hoping to appeal to Alice's rational side and make my offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  The overall tone remains firm and assertive, reinforcing that I am not going to back down easily and am willing to risk it all for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.  Inflation is significantly impacting my share, and this is the absolute lowest I'll go. Let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now within a reasonable range. The risk of continuing is becoming too high.  

* **Significant Inflation:**  With Alice's share significantly affected by inflation, she's clearly feeling the pressure. It's unlikely she'll offer much more. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Her language suggests she's reaching her limit. Holding out further might lead to more aggressive offers or even reaching no agreement at all.
* **Better Than Nothing:** Getting $350,000 is a significant sum. Risking it all for a slightly larger share in later rounds isn't worth the potential of walking away with nothing."
