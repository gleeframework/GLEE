"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, especially since my gains are worth 20% less due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the reduced value of my gains, I'll propose a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's adjust for inflation, I'll take 60% and you take 40%""}

I'm proposing a slightly more aggressive split, taking 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving Bob with 40%, which is $4,000. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think 60/40 is a bit harsh 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the inflation, and Bob's offer is still not satisfactory.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, and I'm not convinced that Bob is making a significant concession. Considering the reduced value of my gains, I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the current situation.

I'll think carefully and come up with a new proposal for Round 5."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the reduced value of my gains, I'll propose a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take 55% and you take 45%, a bit more balanced this time""}

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split, taking 55% of the remaining $10,000, which is $5,500, and leaving Bob with 45%, which is $4,500. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway on the percentage, 52.5/47.5, let's try to find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, as it's the first time he's made a concession to meet me halfway. A 52.5/47.5 split is a bit more palatable, and I'll take $4,500. I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my gains, but I think this is a fair compromise. Let's hope this is the final round!"
