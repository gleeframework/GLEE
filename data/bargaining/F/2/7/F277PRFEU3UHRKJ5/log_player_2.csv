Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value diminishes for her. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I believe I can still push for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be real, Alice.  This is the fairest deal. Take it before the value drops even further.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point. The longer this drags on, the worse it is for Alice, but it also increases the risk for me if she gets desperate.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair. Alice might be holding out hope for a better deal, but it's getting less rational for her with each passing round.
* **Strong Stance:** Offering a 50/50 split now shows I'm serious, but also willing to be fair.  It might be the push Alice needs to accept before the pressure gets to her."
