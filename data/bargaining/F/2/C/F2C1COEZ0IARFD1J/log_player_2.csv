"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be efficient, Bob. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  It's a good deal for you in the first round, considering how quickly the money loses value. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's a good start, but 30% isn't enough considering the rate of inflation.  I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fairer deal considering the inflation, and I believe we can both benefit from getting the money sooner rather than later.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The money is losing value fast, especially for you. I'm proposing 65/35. It's a better deal than you'll get in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hurting me significantly, and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next few rounds. It's better to take 35% now than risk getting nothing at all."
