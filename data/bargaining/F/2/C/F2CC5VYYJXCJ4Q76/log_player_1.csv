Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Finally! Bob is being incredibly stubborn. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal later as inflation eats away at the total."
