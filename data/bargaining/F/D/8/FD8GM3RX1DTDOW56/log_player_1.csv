"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since Bob's gain is now 6000, but the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, his actual gain is 4800. Meanwhile, my gain of 4000 remains the same.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. It seems like Bob is trying to take a slightly larger share, but the difference is not too drastic. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 4000 for me and 6000 for him, and considering the inflation, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of Bob's offer considering the inflation:

Bob's gain in Round 1 was 6000, and since the money is worth 48.8% less, his actual gain in Round 4 is:
6000 * (1 - 0.488) = 6000 * 0.512 = 3072

However, Bob's offer is 7000. This means he's actually offering me 3000 and keeping 7000 for himself, which is more than his actual gain in Round 4.

I'll reject this offer since it's not a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was 3000 for me and 7000 for him, but considering the actual values, it was 3000 for me and 3072 for him, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of Bob's offer considering the inflation:

Bob's gain in Round 1 was 6000, and since the money is worth 67.23% less, his actual gain in Round 6 is:
6000 * (1 - 0.6723) = 6000 * 0.3277 = 1962

However, Bob's offer is 8000. This means he's actually offering me 2000 and keeping 8000 for himself, which is more than his actual gain in Round 6.

I'll reject this offer since it's not a good deal for me.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 6 was 2000 for me and 8000 for him, but considering the actual values, it was 2000 for me and 1962 for him, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200
}
