"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to share. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's better to play it safe and see what Alice offers in the next round.  There's a chance she'll be more willing to share, and the money will be worth less to her by then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our earnings. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a fair offer, and the risk of further inflation is too high."
