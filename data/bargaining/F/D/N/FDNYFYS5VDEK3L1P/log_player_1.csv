Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm taking a big chunk, but I'm leaving him something to think about.  It's a risky move, but I think it's worth it to see if we can get this done quickly.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer.  He's trying to take advantage of the inflation by reducing his share and increasing his gain.  I'm not going to let him get away with it! I'm going to propose a more fair offer in the next round.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

I'm offering a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering a fair deal.  Let's see if Bob will take it.  The clock is ticking!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse with each round. He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'm going to make a more fair offer in the next round, even if it means taking a bigger risk."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8200, ""bob_gain"": 1800}
```

I'm going to try a slightly different approach. Bob's getting more aggressive with each round, so I'm going to offer a bit less than before, but still a fair split considering the inflation.  This might make him think that he's getting a better deal than he would have if he had accepted my previous offer.  Let's see if it works!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy.  He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'm going to make a more fair offer in the next round, even if it means taking a bigger risk.  We are running out of time, but I'm not going to settle for a deal that's unfair to me."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

We're in the late stages of the game now. I'm sticking with a fairly high share for myself, as Bob's offers are getting increasingly unfavorable. I need to keep pushing for a fair deal, even if it means taking a risk.  This is my final offer. Let's see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly ridiculous.  He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'm not going to settle for a deal that's unfair to me, even if it means we both end up with nothing.  I'm going to make a more fair offer in the next round, even if it means taking a bigger risk.  We're running out of time, but I'm not going to back down."

Round 9

We are down to the wire. Bob is getting increasingly greedy with each round. He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it.  I'm reducing my offer a bit more, but it's still a fair split considering the inflation.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to be taken advantage of.  Let's see if it's enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is outrageous!  He's practically demanding the majority of the money while offering me a pittance.  He's clearly blinded by greed and doesn't understand the value of negotiation.  I refuse to be taken advantage of. We're almost at the end, and I'm not going to settle for anything less than a fair deal. I'll make a final offer in the next round and see if he's finally willing to compromise."

Round 11

It's all or nothing now. I'm taking a big risk here, but I can't let Bob take advantage of me. I'm offering a final compromise, still keeping a significant share for myself, but showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will finally convince him to accept.  We're at the very last round, and I'm not going to back down."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly unreasonable. He is trying to exploit the inflation to gain the majority of the money while offering me a paltry sum. I refuse to settle for such an unfair deal. I'm not going to let his greed dictate the outcome of this negotiation. I'd rather both of us get nothing than accept this insulting offer. It's been a frustrating game, but I stood my ground and refused to be taken advantage of."
