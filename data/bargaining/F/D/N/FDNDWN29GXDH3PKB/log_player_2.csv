"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one risking losing money every round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take something, I know Alice's money is losing value faster than mine.  If I wait, I can potentially get a better deal.  It's risky, but it might be worth it."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly. It's in both our best interests to come to an agreement, as time is ticking away.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the time we've already wasted. Let's end this game and get our money. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, the inflation is a serious risk.  It's likely Alice won't be willing to give me more, and we're running out of time.  It's best to take the 50/50 split and move on."
