Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40% and keeping 60% for myself.  What do you say?

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm offering you 4500, and I'll take 5500.  Let's get this done!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's in both our best interests to reach an agreement before the money loses too much value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though I'd prefer to have a bit more, it's better to take the 5000 now than risk losing more money due to inflation."
