"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where each of us gets $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about the offer. However, it's still a decent proposal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
