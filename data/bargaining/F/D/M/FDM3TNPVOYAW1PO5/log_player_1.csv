I'm going to offer a split that favors me slightly, but still gives Bob a decent amount.  It's the first round, so I want to try and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation means my gain is worth less with each round. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best way to guarantee a reasonable outcome."
