"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually more generous than mine was in the first round, in terms of the actual value of the money he's offering me.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
