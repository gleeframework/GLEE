"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  The inflation rate is a factor, but it seems like the best way to avoid a stalemate is to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
