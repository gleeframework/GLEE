"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $70 and leave $30 for Bob. This is a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
