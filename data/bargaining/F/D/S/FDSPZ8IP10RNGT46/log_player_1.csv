Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to get the majority of the money!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the relative value of the offer. In this round, I'm essentially getting 80% of the value I would have gotten in the previous round, and Bob is getting 90% of the value he would have gotten.

Given the inflation adjustment, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'll...
