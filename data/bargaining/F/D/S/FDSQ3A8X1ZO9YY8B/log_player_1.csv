Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much, let's just get it over with""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the smaller share, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing more value due to inflation.
