"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if I should accept it yet.

I'll reject the offer from Bob for Round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was slightly more generous, I'll try to make a more attractive offer this time.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his original offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $450,000 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273 inflation) = $618,118
Bob gain: $550,000 / 0.727 = $755,882

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
