"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining 10% in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no tricks! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, as my gain would be worth less than in the first round. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, but I'll give you a decent share. Accept and let's move on!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll get a decent chunk too 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of its original value. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think it over.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as 400,000 is still a decent chunk of money, even with the inflation. I'll take it and end the game."
