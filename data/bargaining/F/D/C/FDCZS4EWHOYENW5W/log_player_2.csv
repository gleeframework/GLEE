This is a tough one, but with the rapidly increasing inflation, it's getting too risky.  Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The money is losing value fast. Waiting any longer means a significantly smaller pie for both of us.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice seems stuck on getting a larger share, even if it means both of us get less overall. 
* **Potential for Loss:** If I reject this, there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the next round. We might both end up with much less. 

While 43% isn't ideal, it's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting even less later."
