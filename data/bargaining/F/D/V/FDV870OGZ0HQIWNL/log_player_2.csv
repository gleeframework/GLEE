Do you accept this offer?","```json

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to wait and see if Alice is willing to compromise further."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The clock is ticking and the value is decreasing.  Let's just split it evenly, 50/50, and call it a day.  
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still believe I can get a slightly better deal than a 50/50 split, especially given the inflation affecting Alice more than me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer to the deadline.  I'm willing to offer 65/35, which is a fair compromise considering the inflation's impact on your share. Let's wrap this up.""}

# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal split, and the risk of losing everything due to the deadline is too high. I'll accept this offer."
