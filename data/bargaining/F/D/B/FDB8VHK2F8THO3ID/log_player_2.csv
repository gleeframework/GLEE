Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. Time is literally money in this scenario. This is a slight improvement on your offer, acknowledging the increasing pressure on both our ends. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the fact that I lose value slower. While the pressure is on, accepting an offer where I get less than 50% is not in my best interest, especially with 7 rounds remaining.  I need to show firmness to push for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  A perfectly even split.  It's clear we both want a deal, and this is the fairest way to do it with the time remaining.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to accept anything less than 50% given her previous offers. Holding out further risks losing even more to inflation. A 50/50 split is the cleanest and fairest solution at this point."
