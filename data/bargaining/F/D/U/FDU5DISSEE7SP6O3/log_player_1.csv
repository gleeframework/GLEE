"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, I'll take the risk of inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly to avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation."
