"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60 and you take 40. It's a good starting point for a win-win situation.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and leave $40 for Bob. This is a fair split, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
