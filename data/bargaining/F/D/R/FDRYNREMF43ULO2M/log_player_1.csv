"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total amount, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll be getting 80% of 10, which is 8 dollars.

Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'll be getting 95% of 90, which is 85.5 dollars.

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll offer a slightly higher share to Bob to make up for it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for you, but I'm still hoping to get a decent share!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm still keeping a bit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! My share is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll be getting 51.2% of my original share, which is approximately 4.16 dollars.

Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less, so he'll be getting 85.74% of his original share, which is approximately 85.74 dollars.

Considering the significant decrease in value, I think meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise. I'd rather get a smaller share now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
