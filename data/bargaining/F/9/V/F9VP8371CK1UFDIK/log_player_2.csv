# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's too early in the game to settle for such a small portion. There's a good chance Bob can negotiate a better deal with a few rounds of bargaining."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting a better deal each round, but I'm still the one making the first move! 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Although the offer is better than the first round, there's still a chance Bob can negotiate a more favorable deal.  Alice is getting a larger share, and Bob can likely improve his position with continued negotiation."

# Bob gain: 1750 
# Alice gain: 8250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Despite the pressure and Alice's taunts, Bob should still reject this offer. The money he's receiving is decreasing significantly due to inflation, and there's still a chance to negotiate a better outcome. Even though Alice has the advantage, she's still willing to bargain, indicating potential for a more balanced deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 3000, ""alice_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation is hurting my gains, but I'm still willing to negotiate. This is a fair offer, and we can end this game before it gets worse for me.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're really struggling to keep up, Bob! Better accept now! 
# Bob gain: 1250 
# Alice gain: 8750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is tempting, Bob should still reject it. He's losing a lot of money with each passing round due to inflation.  It's risky, but there's still a chance he can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds.  He's losing very little by rejecting and continuing the game, while accepting this offer locks him into a very unfavorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 2500, ""alice_gain"": 7500, ""message"": ""Alice, with each round, I'm losing more money. I'm offering you a larger share because I know time is running out for me. Let's reach an agreement now.""}

# Bob gain: 750 
# Alice gain: 9250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should reject this offer. Even though he's losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, it's still too early to give in. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, but Bob has two rounds left to negotiate a better outcome. He's losing very little by continuing the game and risking a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10

{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to accept a smaller share to end this. This is my final offer. Let's end it now.""}
