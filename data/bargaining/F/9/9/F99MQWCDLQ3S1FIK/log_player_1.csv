"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's more fair to split the money evenly. Let's go for 50/50.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
