"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for both of us to settle quickly. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth seeing if we can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation rate.  We have 12 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  But with the ticking clock and inflation, I believe this offer is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and our potential gains are shrinking. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the need for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice is acknowledging the pressure of time and inflation, I'm still not happy with this split. I'm willing to be flexible, but I believe we can find a more balanced solution.  I need to see if we can work toward a more equal split, especially with the significant inflation rate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. This offer is a significant step towards a fair solution, but it still gives me a larger share. I'm confident that we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. This offer is a serious attempt to reach a fair agreement before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, with the inflation continuing to eat away at our potential gains, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  It's a fair compromise and ensures that we both receive a reasonable amount of money."
