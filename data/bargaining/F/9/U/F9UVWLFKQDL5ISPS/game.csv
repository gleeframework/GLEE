7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This ensures both parties receive a fair share while considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects the value depreciation and provides a fair compromise for both of us.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
