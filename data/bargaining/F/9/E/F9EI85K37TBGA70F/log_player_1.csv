"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Considering the inflation effect, the 40% I would gain in this round is equivalent to 48% of the original $100, which is $48. The 60% Bob would gain is equivalent to 54% of the original $100, which is $54.

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my share, but I think I'll accept this offer. After all, it's better than going to the next round and risking even more inflation!
