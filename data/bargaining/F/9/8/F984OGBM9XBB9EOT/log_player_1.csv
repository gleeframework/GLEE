"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting $4000, which is equivalent to $4200 in the first round. Not bad, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal this time""}

I'm trying to get a bit more than Bob's last offer, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to reassess the offer. If I accept this, I'll be getting $4800, which is equivalent to $5400 in the first round. It's not a bad deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50 again""}

I'm going back to the original 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise now that we've both had a chance to adjust to the inflation."
