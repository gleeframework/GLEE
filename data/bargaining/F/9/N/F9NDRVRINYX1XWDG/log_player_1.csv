"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I'm getting even more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was a bit more generous than mine in the first round, I'll try to make a slightly better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

  ""bob_gain"": 35

Bob's offer is still a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if it's enough to justify accepting it. I'll have to think carefully...
