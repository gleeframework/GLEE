"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a good tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy on the first round, now I'll take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take the lead!

I'll think carefully before responding...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I don't want to give up the potential for a better deal later on. I'm hoping to get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value, so I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, hoping to find a balance between getting a good deal and not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm not backing down! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

Considering the significant drop in the value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully before responding...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the value of the money I'd gain is worth even less than before, and I'm not willing to accept such a low share. I'm hoping to get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 39.2% of its original value, so I'll aim for an even higher percentage to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm not giving up yet! Last chance for a fair deal?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 38/62 split, hoping to find a balance between getting a good deal and not giving up too much. This is my last attempt to get a reasonable offer, and I'm warning Bob that I might not get a better deal in the next round."
