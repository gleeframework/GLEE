Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to settle this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the best offer Bob is likely to get at this point.  Here's why:

* **Inflation is hurting Alice more:**  Alice's share is losing value far quicker than Bob's. This makes her increasingly desperate for a deal *now*.
* **Time pressure:**  With only 7 rounds left, the total amount to be split diminishes significantly with each passing round.
* **Previous rejections:** Alice has consistently rejected offers where Bob receives a larger share. The 50/50 split suggests a shift in her negotiating position.

Holding out for a better offer is too risky. Bob's bargaining power is higher now than it will be in later rounds."
