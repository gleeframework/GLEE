"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping for a more equal split, and this proposal still favors Bob too much. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one."

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much either""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. The split is still very unfair, and I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives Bob a 65% share of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
