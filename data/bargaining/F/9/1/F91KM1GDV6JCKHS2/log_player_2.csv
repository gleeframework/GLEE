Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of a 42/58 split is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob. We are already in round 5, and waiting longer will only lead to a worse deal for him.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a better offer in the later rounds carries a significant risk. There's no guarantee Alice will be more generous, and even a small increase in Bob's share might not be worth the loss in value from inflation. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a share, while rejecting risks walking away with nothing if a deal isn't reached in the remaining rounds. 

While Bob might prefer a more equitable split, accepting the current offer prevents a worse outcome in the long run."
