"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer was absurd. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value of money with inflation - you're losing buying power with each round. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
