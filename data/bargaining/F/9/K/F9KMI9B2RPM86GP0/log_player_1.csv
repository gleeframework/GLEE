"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm open to negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. My message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, Alice. I'll take a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining value. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the inflation:

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split it 50-50.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to be more competitive with Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I'm not budging much. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less. I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining value. I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping he'll be more generous."
