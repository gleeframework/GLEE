# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate from the middle!

I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm!""

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns!

Considering the money is worth even less for me now, I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```

I'm trying to hold out for a better deal, but I know the clock is ticking!"
