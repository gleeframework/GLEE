{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  It's a lot of money, but I want to establish a cooperative spirit and avoid the risk of losing everything in the later rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, even considering the inflation.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to acknowledge the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money.  Bob's rejection shows he's willing to play hardball, so I need to be more assertive while remaining fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse. Even though my share is worth less due to inflation,  I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and continue to fight for a more equitable division."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to account for the increasing inflation, but I'm still aiming for a majority share of the money.  Bob's continued rejection shows that he's hoping to get most of the money, but I'm not going to let him take advantage of the situation."

# Bob gain: 700000
