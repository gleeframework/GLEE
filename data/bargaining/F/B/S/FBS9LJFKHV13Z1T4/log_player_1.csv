"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start with a high value of money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled about accepting a 60-40 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
