"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer ensures I get the majority of the money, while still giving Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  Since this is the first round, I am not worried about inflation affecting my share yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, this is a better deal for me than the previous round.  I'm taking a significant loss, but I'd rather have something than nothing at all."
