"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob will take 40%, which is $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's a good deal and accept!"
