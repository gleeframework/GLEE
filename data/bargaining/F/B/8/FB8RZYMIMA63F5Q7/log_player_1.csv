"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a generous offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, Bob gets 40% of the initial amount, which is still a significant amount considering the potential for inflation. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to make sure I'm not giving up too much potential value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
