I'm going for a big share in the first round, hoping to get Bob to accept.  It's risky, but the inflation could really hurt me later on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While Bob's offer is much better than my initial proposal, I still believe I can get a better deal.  With inflation, the money I gain is worth less each round, but I think I can still negotiate a fairer split.  I'll try to make a counter-offer that's more favorable for me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a more moderate offer this time.  I want to avoid another rejection, but I'm still aiming for a larger share than Bob's offer.  I need to balance the risk of another rejection with the need to secure some decent gains before the inflation kicks in too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. The inflation is really starting to take its toll, and I need to secure some money before it gets even worse.  While I'd prefer a bigger share, this offer is still better than nothing, and I'm not confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next few rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
