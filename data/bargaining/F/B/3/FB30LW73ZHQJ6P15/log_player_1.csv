I'm going to start with a proposal that is very favorable to me, but still gives Bob something. I'm hoping that he will be happy to take it and we can avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more, I'm not sure how much longer the game will go on. Taking 5000 now is a safer bet than risking inflation and getting nothing."
