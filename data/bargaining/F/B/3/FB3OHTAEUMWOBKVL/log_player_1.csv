"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'd rather not accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm trying to account for the decreasing value of money and make a more favorable offer for myself."
