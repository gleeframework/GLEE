"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. This is my final offer.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice's value for the money is decreasing at a much faster rate (20% per round) than Bob's (5% per round).  This puts pressure on Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Strong Stance:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling I'm not willing to negotiate much further, pushing Alice towards a decision.
* **Favorable but Firm:** The offer is still somewhat generous to Alice, giving her almost half.  However, it secures a slight advantage for me, which is important considering the shrinking pot."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly in my favor 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, the longer this goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us. Another rejection means risking an even smaller share in future rounds.
* **Alice's Desperation:** Alice's offer is only ""slightly"" in her favor, suggesting she's feeling the pressure of the decreasing value and wants to settle quickly. 
* **Better Than Expected:**  Given her rapid devaluation, I expected her counter-offer to be much lower. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even if it's less than my initial target."
