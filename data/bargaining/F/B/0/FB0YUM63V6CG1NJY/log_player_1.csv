"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the majority of the money, but I'll get a small consolation prize of $200,000. That's a pretty one-sided offer, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still leave you with a decent chunk!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 75/25 split, where I'll get $750,000 and Bob will get $250,000. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob!"

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is still trying to get the better end of the deal, but this offer is a bit more generous than the last one. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. I think I can do better than a 40/60 split. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"

}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I'll get $600,000 and Bob will get $400,000. I think this is a more balanced offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

```
