# Alice gain: 3000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 3000/7000 split. I was hoping for a more even split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."

I'm not happy with the 2000/8000 split. The money is worth significantly less now, and I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 2500, ""bob_gain"": 7500, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll try again!""}

I'm proposing a 25/75 split, where I'll take 2,500 and Bob will take 7,500. I'm trying to be more flexible and willing to give up more, but I'm not sure if this will be enough to convince Bob."

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really struggling with the idea of accepting such a low offer. The money is worth a lot less now, and I'm not willing to accept a 1,000/9,000 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again, hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."

I'm proposing a 15/85 split, where I'll take 1,500 and Bob will take 8,500. I'm trying to be as flexible as possible, but I'm not sure if this will be enough to convince Bob. This is my last attempt, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually acceptable solution."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really running out of options, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely disappointed with the 500/9500 split. The money is worth a significant amount less now, and I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share. I've tried to be flexible and compromise, but this offer is unacceptable. I'll reject it and accept the fact that I'll have to walk away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I think I've already reached the end of the road. Since I've rejected all of Bob's offers, I'll just propose a 0/10,000 split, effectively giving Bob the entire sum. It's not like I have any other options at this point.

{""alice_gain"": 0, ""bob_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""I'm out of options, Bob. You win.""}

I'm not happy about it, but I'm willing to concede defeat."
