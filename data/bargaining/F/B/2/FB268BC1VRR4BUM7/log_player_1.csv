"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal and avoids any further negotiation.  
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, but I still don't want to give up as much as Bob is offering.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give up half of the money, Bob. Can you consider a smaller share for me?""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and asking Bob to consider a smaller share for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take a smaller share, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
