"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob, which seems like a reasonable starting point. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and start fresh 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts I would gain in Round 2 are:

* Alice gain: 4500
* Bob gain: 4500

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
