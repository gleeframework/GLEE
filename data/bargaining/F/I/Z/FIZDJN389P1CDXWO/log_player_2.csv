Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point, considering the inflation we're both facing. Let's avoid another round and just end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
