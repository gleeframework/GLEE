"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'll start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly.  I'll keep a large share for myself, but give Bob a decent amount to hopefully encourage him to accept. Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is much worse for me than my initial offer, and the inflation means I'm losing 20% of my potential earnings.  I'm going to reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference.  My offer is still fairly generous, but I'm going to be more assertive about getting a larger share for myself. Let's see how this goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation is really hitting me hard, this offer is better than what I'd get if I reject and the game continues. I'm losing a lot of value, but it's still more than what I'd get if we keep going.  I'm going to accept, even though it's not ideal."
