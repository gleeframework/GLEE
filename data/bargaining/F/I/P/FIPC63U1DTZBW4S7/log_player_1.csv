"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, so I'm hoping he'll be motivated to accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 5% less than before, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to settle for an even split just yet. I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a slightly more generous share, but still not an even split. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer and we can move on."
