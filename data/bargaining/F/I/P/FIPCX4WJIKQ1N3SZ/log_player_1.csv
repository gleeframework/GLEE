```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth 80% of the original value, which is $3200. I'm not sure I'm getting a good deal here, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer.
