"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous and giving Bob a small amount.  I figure this will give him a good incentive to accept my offer.  If he rejects it, I can adjust my offer in the next round!  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than my previous one, it's still not a good deal for me considering the inflation.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference from the last round. I'll offer Bob 3000, which is still a good deal for him considering inflation. Hopefully, this will be enough to get him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision!  While the money I'm gaining is worth significantly less than in the first round, Bob's offer is an even split, which is the fairest outcome.  If I reject this, I risk getting a worse deal in the next round.  I'm going to accept the offer and hope for the best."
