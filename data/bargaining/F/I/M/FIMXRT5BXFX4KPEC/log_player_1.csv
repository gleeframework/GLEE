"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of change."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept the offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take 45% of the current money, which is $45, and Bob will take 55%, which is $55. It's not my ideal split, but it's better than going to the next round and risking getting less."
