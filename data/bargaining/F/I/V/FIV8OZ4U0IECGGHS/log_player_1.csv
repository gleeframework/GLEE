"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,500 and I'll take $5,500. I've included a message to Bob saying ""Let's be fair!"" to try to persuade him to accept my offer. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so I'm trying to get a slight advantage while still being somewhat reasonable. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn! I'll do slightly better than your offer last round considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob's offer of $4,750 for me is lower than what I initially offered him, and I'm not willing to accept that. I'll make a new proposal in the next round to try to get a more favorable outcome. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nI've made a new offer to Bob, taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of the money. I'm now offering him $4,800 and I'll take $5,200. My message to Bob suggests meeting in the middle, trying to find a compromise that we can both accept. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement before it's too late! Let me know how Bob responds."
