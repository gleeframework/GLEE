Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive opening offer.  I want to get a good chunk of the money, knowing that it will be worth less in the next round. However, I'm also willing to give Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, I realize that the inflation rate is working against me.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the money, and any further rounds will likely result in a lower payout due to inflation."
