"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my first offer. It's a very simple proposal, but I want to see how Bob responds. I'm starting with a very high share for myself to see if he'll accept it or not. I am expecting him to decline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a larger share, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  500,000 is a good amount of money, and it's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will propose something even more unfavorable in the future rounds."
