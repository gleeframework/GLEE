"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $475,000
Bob gain: $475,000

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as it's a 50/50 split, but I'll accept it since it's a fair offer and we'll both get a decent amount of money.
