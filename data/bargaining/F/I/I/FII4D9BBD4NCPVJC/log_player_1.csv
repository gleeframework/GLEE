"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $45 is actually worth $36 in the original currency.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'd rather get a bigger share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll reject this offer for now.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and considering the inflation effect, my offer will be:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68
}
```
I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game before the next round's inflation hits."
