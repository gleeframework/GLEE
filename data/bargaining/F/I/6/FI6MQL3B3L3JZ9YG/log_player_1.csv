"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose to keep almost all the money for myself, giving Bob just $1. This is a risky strategy, but it ensures I get the biggest share possible in the first round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, there's a chance he might be desperate enough to accept even a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is a fair split. I don't know how inflation is affecting him, so accepting this ensures I get a significant amount and avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
