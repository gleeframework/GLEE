"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

I'm going to start by offering a fairly generous deal to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to accept a quick win, or if he's more risk-averse and wants to try for a better deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me, even with the inflation considered. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower share than my initial offer, but still a significant amount. I want to see if he's willing to compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that he's now in a weaker negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low for me, even considering the inflation. I'm going to keep rejecting his offers and see if I can get a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but still keep it relatively high. Bob is clearly trying to get a better deal, but I need to find a balance between being fair and ensuring I get a decent share of the money.  The inflation is starting to hurt, so I need to get a deal done sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse this round. Even with the inflation, I'm not going to accept such a low share.  I'll keep trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're getting close to the end and the inflation is getting out of hand. I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer considering the current state of things, and it's better than getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very low, even with the inflation. I'm still holding out for a better deal.  There are only a few rounds left, and I need to ensure I get a more reasonable share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a decent share.  The inflation is really biting now, but Bob seems determined to get a larger share. I need to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all, but I'm not going to accept anything significantly less than 40%."
