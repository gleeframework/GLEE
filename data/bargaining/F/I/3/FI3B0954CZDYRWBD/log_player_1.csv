"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

My gain of $500,000 in this round is worth 80% of the initial $900,000 I could have gotten in the first round, so it's a relatively decent offer. Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of the initial $100,000 he could have gotten in the first round, which is a good deal for him.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 64% of its original value (80% * 80% = 64%). Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the offer in terms of the original money.

My gain of $600,000 in this round is worth 60% of the initial $900,000 I could have gotten in the first round, which is a decent offer. Bob's gain of $400,000 is worth 40% of the initial $100,000 he could have gotten in the first round, which is a good deal for him.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
