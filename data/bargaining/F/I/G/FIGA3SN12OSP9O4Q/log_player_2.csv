"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm taking into account the inflation, but I believe a more even split is fair, given the increasing devaluation of the money.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hitting me harder. I'm taking a small hit from my previous offer, but this split makes the most sense. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
