"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money, and we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."

# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take 75% 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'm not accepting this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.
