"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, especially since Bob's money is worth 20% less due to inflation. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, I'll give you a bit more this time""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a slightly more favorable split for Bob compared to my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, considering the effects of inflation on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, considering the effects of inflation on his end. The 55/45 split is still slightly in his favor, but it's a more reasonable split given the current circumstances. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
