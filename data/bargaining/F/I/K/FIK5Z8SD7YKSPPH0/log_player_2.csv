Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early to accept such a low offer.  I'll see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is now offering a 40/60 split, which is better than the 30/70 split she offered in the first round.  Considering the inflation, this is a reasonable offer."
