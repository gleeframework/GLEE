I'm starting with a very uneven split, hoping Bob will accept and we can get this over with quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, it's better to get something than nothing.  Inflation is a serious factor here, and a 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances."
