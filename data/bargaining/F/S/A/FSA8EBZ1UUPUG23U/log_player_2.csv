"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though I'm getting a large chunk of the money, there's no guarantee that Alice won't offer me less in the next round. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm taking a risk here, but I think it's worth it. I'm hoping that Alice will realize that the longer the game goes on, the less value the money will have."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is better than my previous offer, and the value of the money is declining.  It's time to secure a win, even if it's not the ideal outcome."
