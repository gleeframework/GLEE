"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars, and Bob would get 40 dollars. My message is a friendly suggestion to split the money 60-40, which is a relatively fair split, but I'm leaving room for negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a more balanced split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 45 dollars is actually worth 36 dollars (since it's 20% less than the original 60 dollars).

Considering Bob's offer, I think 55-45 is a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor, especially considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so my gain is worth 28.8 dollars (20% less than 36 dollars).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to meet Bob in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
