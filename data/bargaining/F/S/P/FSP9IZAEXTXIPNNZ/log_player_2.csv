"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I get $60, you get $40. It's a good offer for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to try to get a better deal.  I know Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but I'm going to see if I can get a bigger share.  Let's see what she offers next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll come down to $58, you get $42.  The clock is ticking and the money is shrinking! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I still think I can get a better deal. I'm going to see if I can get her to offer closer to 50/50, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money evenly. It's the fairest option, and we can avoid further losses to inflation. Let's call it a day and agree to this.""}
