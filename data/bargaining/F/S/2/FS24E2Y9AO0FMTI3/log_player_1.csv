"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight compromise, considering the initial offer was too generous for me. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not willing to give away too much due to the uncertainty of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
