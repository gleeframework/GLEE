This is a tough one! Here's why I'm accepting, even though it's a bad deal:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds left, the inflation is killing my potential gains. 
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting worse, and there's no guarantee he'll suddenly offer me more.
* **Something is Better than Nothing:**  If I reject this, there's a real chance we both walk away with nothing. 

While 200,000 is much less than I'd like, it's better to take a loss now than risk losing everything."
