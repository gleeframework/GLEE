"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20 bucks!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split in my favor, but I'm being generous and giving Bob a decent amount to start with. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so the effective gain for me in this round is 80% of 80, which is 64. And Bob's gain is 5% less, so it's 95% of 20, which is 19.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```

}

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
