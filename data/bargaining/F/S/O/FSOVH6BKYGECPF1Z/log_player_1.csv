"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This offer is more reasonable than my previous offer, but still leaves me with a decent share. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is not ideal, but considering the inflation, accepting it is the best choice. I'm losing a significant amount of value each round, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the next round."
