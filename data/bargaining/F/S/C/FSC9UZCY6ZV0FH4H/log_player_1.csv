Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. However, your offer was quite far from an even split. Let's be a bit more realistic. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
