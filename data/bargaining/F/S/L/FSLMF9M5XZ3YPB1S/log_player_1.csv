"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, my friend!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%. This is a fair and reasonable split, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

In this round, the total amount is still $100, but my gain of 40 is worth 10% less than the 60 I initially proposed, and Bob's gain of 60 is worth 5% less than the 40 he initially proposed.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him than my initial proposal. I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 40% for me and 60% for him, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45% gain for myself and a 55% gain for Bob."
