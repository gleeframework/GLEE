"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a decent starting point. I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself, but I'm leaving enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $500,000 is actually worth $400,000 (0.8 x $500,000).

I'm not thrilled about splitting it evenly, but it's a fair offer and it's getting harder to make a better proposal with each passing round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
