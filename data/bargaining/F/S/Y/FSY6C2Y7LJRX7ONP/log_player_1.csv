I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one initiating the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm offering Bob 550,000 and taking 450,000 for myself. Since we're both now in a less advantageous position due to inflation, I've adjusted the split to reflect this."
