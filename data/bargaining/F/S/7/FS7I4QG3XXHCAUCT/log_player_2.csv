Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not intimidated by the 'final offer' rhetoric. I think we can still find a better compromise.

# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I'm holding firm. Accepting now would mean losing out on a significant chunk of the initial sum.  It's risky, but I'm hoping she'll become more agreeable as the rounds progress and the money continues to lose value."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  This offer is more than fair. Let's close this deal and walk away with something substantial.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm edging closer to a 50/50 split, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a slight advantage.  The message emphasizes the shrinking pot due to inflation, putting pressure on Alice to accept before the value diminishes further."
