"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer since it's better than nothing, but I also want to see if he's willing to negotiate in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is very unfair, even with the inflation considered.  I'm going to reject and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to lower my demand slightly, but still keep a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a compromise and accept the offer."
