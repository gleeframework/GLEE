**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inch her way to a better deal, knowing that the inflation hurts me more than her.  While the gap is closing, I still believe I can get a slightly better outcome in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose if we don't agree soon.  Let's settle on our previous terms: 55/45.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on, and I need to signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. Repeating my previous offer of 55/45 achieves several things:

* **Shows firmness:** I'm not going to be endlessly chipped away at.
* **Highlights losses:**  The message reminds Alice that the money is shrinking for both of us. 
* **Offers a fair deal:**  While I want a larger share, 55/45 is still a reasonable compromise.

I'm hoping this assertive approach will push Alice to accept before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gain."
