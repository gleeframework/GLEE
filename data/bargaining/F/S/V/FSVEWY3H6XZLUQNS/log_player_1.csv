"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's split it 70/30""}

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the game is just beginning and we don't know each other's negotiation styles yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 70/30 split. This is a more balanced offer, considering the inflation we have to deal with. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled with the offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to accept this offer.
