"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money. This offer gives you a significant amount and avoids the risk of losing value due to inflation in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent amount, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  There's a good chance Alice might be willing to give me more to avoid the risk of inflation, especially since she loses more value per round than I do."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. It avoids any unnecessary risk of inflation and ensures both of us get an equal share."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out.  This offer is a good compromise to ensure we both get a decent share before inflation eats further into the value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a 50/50 split, I think it's wise to accept this offer. Alice is clearly motivated to get a deal done, and  inflation is working against her more than it is against me.  Taking this offer ensures I get a good share of the money and avoids any further risk of the value decreasing."
