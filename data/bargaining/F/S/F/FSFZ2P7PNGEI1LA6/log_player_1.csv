"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider the offer and decide whether to accept or reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, Alice. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the new amounts are:

* My gain: $570,000 (95% of $600,000)
* Bob's gain: $400,000 (80% of $500,000)

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
