"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob.  It seems like a fair starting point, giving Alice a good chunk of the money while also leaving some for Bob, hopefully encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, offering me a mere 100,000 while he takes 900,000.  I'm not going to accept that, especially since he's not affected by inflation.  I'll keep fighting for a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm reducing my share a bit, but still offering Bob a significant amount. The inflation is starting to hurt, so I need to be a bit more flexible but I still want a fair share."

Bob is still being very unfair.  While I'm losing money due to inflation, he's not.  I won't accept this offer, even though I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds.  I'll try to make a better proposal in the next round."

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still offering Bob a larger share than he gave me. This offer is a compromise; I'm trying to find a solution that is both fair and acceptable to him, hoping to avoid the risk of both of us getting nothing."

Bob is being stubborn! He's still taking the lion's share, and I'm getting squeezed by inflation. I'm going to make a counter-offer in the next round, but I'm starting to worry about the dwindling time."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm taking a big risk here, offering a significant chunk to Bob. I'm hoping that he'll see this as a genuine attempt to compromise, especially given the pressure of the dwindling time and the fact that I'm losing money with each passing round. I'm willing to sacrifice some of my potential gain to reach an agreement."

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is still trying to take the majority.  I'm losing a lot due to inflation, and it's clear he's not going to budge. I'm going to make a last ditch effort in the next round to salvage something."
