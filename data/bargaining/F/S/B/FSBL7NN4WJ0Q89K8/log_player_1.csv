I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000. This is a fair offer as I am taking the majority share, reflecting the risk of being the first proposer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I propose to keep $8,000 for myself and give Bob $2,000. This is still a generous offer given the inflation rate and the fact that Bob has repeatedly rejected my proposals.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us to both get something out of this negotiation."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I would prefer to receive something rather than nothing, accepting this offer would be detrimental in the long run.  Bob's offer is extremely unreasonable, and it seems he is attempting to exploit the inflation to his advantage.  I will continue to negotiate for a more equitable split."
