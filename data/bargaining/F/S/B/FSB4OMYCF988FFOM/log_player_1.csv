"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, Bob. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk too.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%. This way, I'll get $800,000 and Bob will get $200,000. The message is just a friendly nudge to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're off to a strong start, but I'm not afraid to negotiate. I'll take a significant chunk, but I'm willing to give you a decent deal too. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, the effective amounts are:

My gain: $400,000 (as proposed by Bob)
Bob's gain: $600,000 (as proposed by Bob)

I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the remaining amount, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
