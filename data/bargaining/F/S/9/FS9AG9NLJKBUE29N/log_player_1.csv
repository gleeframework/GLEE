"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm starting with a very high offer for myself. Since the money loses value with each round, I want to secure as much as possible early on. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd ideally prefer a larger share, it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  The money is losing value with each round, and Bob's offer is a significant improvement over the previous round's 1% share.  Accepting now guarantees me 50% of the remaining value, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
