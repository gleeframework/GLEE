"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the smaller share this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me taking the smaller share of $2,000 and Bob taking the larger share of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take a slightly larger share this time to make up for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4,500 is worth 80% of the original $5,500, which is $4,400, and Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 90% of the original $6,100, which is $4,590.

I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting less than I would if I had accepted the first offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Since my gain is worth 80% of the original, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a bigger share, so I'll take a bigger share to balance it out.""
}
```"
