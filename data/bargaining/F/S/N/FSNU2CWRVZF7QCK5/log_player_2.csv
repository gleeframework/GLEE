Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we both want a larger share. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I need you to meet me halfway.  This offer still ensures we both get a decent amount before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
