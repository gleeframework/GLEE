I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can both get a decent amount of money.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, with the inflation hitting Bob harder, accepting this offer seems like the best option. It's better than risking another round and possibly getting even less."
