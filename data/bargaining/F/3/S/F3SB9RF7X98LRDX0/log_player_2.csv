"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept this generous offer and let's end the game quickly! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's early in the game, and Alice's offer is very lopsided. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal by rejecting and proposing myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""This is a fairer split. Let's agree and move on!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob! The value of the money is dropping fast! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still offering a very unequal split, even with the inflation factor. I'll keep pushing for a fairer division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. It's the only way to ensure we both get a decent amount before the value drops too much further.""}
```"
