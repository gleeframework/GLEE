"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the total amount is now 8,000$. My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the total amount is now worth 80% of the original 8,000$, which is 6,400$. My gain of 4500$ is worth 36% of my original gain of 12,000$ (8,000$ / 0.8). My offer was 6000$, which is 50% of the original 12,000$. Now, Alice's offer is 4500$, which is 70.3% of my original gain. I'll accept this offer.
