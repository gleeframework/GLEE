9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. I think that's a reasonable starting point. Let me know what you think!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,Your offer was quite imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This round is your chance to secure a good amount before inflation eats away at the value.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, I understand your point about being more realistic. I'm willing to come down to a 55/45 split in my favor.  Let's not let inflation erode our gains any further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"I appreciate you moving closer to a fair split. However, I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself.  I propose 52/48. It's a reasonable advantage for me this early in the game, and it still leaves you with a significant sum.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's meet in the middle. I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option at this point, and we can both walk away with a decent amount before inflation erodes our gains further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
