Let's see if Bob likes a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a good start, but I'm ready to negotiate if I have to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy! Even though the money is worth less, I'm not going to accept a 20/80 split in his favor.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to counter with a 60/40 split in my favor. Bob's offer was ridiculous, and I'm hoping this will be more reasonable. I'm still willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in to his demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting tricky!  The inflation is hitting me hard, and Bob is starting to benefit.  Even though I'd prefer more, it's better to take a 40/60 split than risk getting even less in the next round. I'm going to accept this offer."
