"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable starting point, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```

I'm not ready to accept a 55-45 split just yet. I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise."
