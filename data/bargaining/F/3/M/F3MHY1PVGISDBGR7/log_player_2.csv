Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're feeling the pinch, I'll take a bit more. Still a good deal for you? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Returns:**  The inflation is severely eating into Bob's potential gains. Every round makes a significant difference.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice seems determined to take advantage of the situation and is unlikely to agree to a truly fair deal.
* **Something is Better than Nothing:** While $400,000 is significantly less than what Bob could have gotten initially, it's better than continuing to lose money to inflation and potentially ending up with even less. 

Delaying further only weakens Bob's position and gives Alice more leverage to push for an even larger share."
