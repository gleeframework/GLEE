"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation advantage I get in later rounds. Let's see if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting counteroffer from Bob. Considering the inflation advantage he'll get in later rounds, I'll have to be more aggressive to compensate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 55% of the initial amount. I'll need a better deal to make it worth my while.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in Round 2. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to account for the inflation. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle.""
}
```

Your turn!"
