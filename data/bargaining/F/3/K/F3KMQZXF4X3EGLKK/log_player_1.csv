"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me! My offer was rejected, and now I have to consider Bob's new proposal.

After calculating the effective value of the money, I realize that I'm being offered $560,000 (700,000 * 0.8) and Bob is offering himself $240,000 (300,000 * 0.8).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
