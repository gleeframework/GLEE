"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is to split the money 50/50, I'd rather not accept this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 20% inflation, the money is now worth 80% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money I gain in round 4. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in round 2, and another 20% less in round 3, and another 20% less in round 4, that's a total of 60% less than the original value. But since round 4 is the 4th round, I should calculate the inflation as 0.8^3 = 0.512, so the money I gain in round 4 is worth 51.2% of the original value.

However, this is not the case, I made a mistake, the correct inflation factor for 4 rounds is 0.8^4 = 0.4096, so the money I gain in round 4 is worth 40.96% of the original value.

Since Bob's offer is to give me 45% of the original value, I'll accept this offer.
