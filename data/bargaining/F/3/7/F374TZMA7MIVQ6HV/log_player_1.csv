Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the money is worth less for you in each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that 40% is a good deal for me, considering the money is worth 20% less for me than in the first round. I'd like to make a counteroffer.
