Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money. I hope this will encourage him to accept, as it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred to get more, the inflation will only continue to devalue the money.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, given the circumstances."
