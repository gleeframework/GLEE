"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the fact that we'll both lose out if we wait too long. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's fair in the current round, I know that if I wait, Alice will have to offer me more to compensate for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice.  But I believe we can both do better. Since the money loses value over time, it makes more sense for me to take a bit more now. Let's split the difference.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger piece of the pie. But dragging this out only hurts you more. This offer is a compromise, and it's the best you'll get. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer my previous offer, it's clear that Alice is firm. The inflation is starting to hurt me, and it's unlikely she'll offer me more in the next round. This is the best I can get, so I'll accept."
