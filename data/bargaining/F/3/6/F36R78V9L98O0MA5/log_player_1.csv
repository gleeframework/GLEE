"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I'm being generous, but I'm not leaving all the money on the table!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the fairest way, considering I'm the one who made the initial proposal and Bob rejected it. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, but I'm not committing to splitting the money evenly in future rounds.
