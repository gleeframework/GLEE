I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, knowing Bob will likely reject it. This is a good strategy to get the ball rolling and see how much Bob values his gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is offering a much fairer split, but I'm still going to reject it. The inflation is starting to affect the value of the money, and I want to see if I can push for a better deal."

Bob's offer is very close to being equal, and the inflation is now really starting to hit, but I'm still going to reject. I believe I can get a slightly better deal, especially since his offer is almost equal."

Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one. The inflation is really starting to bite, but Bob's offer is getting more and more favorable to him.  I'm still going to reject, though, hoping to get a slightly better deal before we both lose too much to inflation."

Round 7

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000

{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one. The inflation has eroded the value of the money significantly. While I'm getting a much smaller share than I would have liked, it's better than losing everything. This offer is a decent compromise, given the current inflation rate."
