"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to propose a split of $9000 for me and $1000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, given that I get to make the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my initial proposal, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. Inflation will continue to devalue the money Bob gains, and if I reject this offer, I risk getting a worse deal in the future."
