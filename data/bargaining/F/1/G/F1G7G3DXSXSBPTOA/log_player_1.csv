"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
``` 

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor.  Since I'm the one making the offer, I figure I should get the bigger share.  But I'm leaving some for Bob so he's not completely shut out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, and if I reject, I risk ending up with nothing in the next round.  A 70/30 split is better than nothing."
