"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. My reasoning is that, since Bob's money loses value over time, he should be more eager to accept an offer earlier in the game. By offering him a smaller share, I'm testing his willingness to accept a less favorable deal in order to avoid further losses due to inflation. The message ""Let's share fairly"" is an attempt to make the offer seem more reasonable and appealing to Bob.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This time I'm going to propose a slightly more favorable deal for myself, but I hope you'll still accept it. It's still a decent amount of money for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because it gives him a larger share of the money, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I don't feel pressured to accept a less favorable offer. Additionally, Bob's message seems to indicate that he's willing to compromise, so I think I can push for a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than in the first round, but still less than what he offered me in the second round. By saying ""Meet me in the middle"", I'm framing the offer as a compromise and trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less with each passing round, I believe he should be more willing to accept a reasonable offer to minimize his losses. Let's see if he'll accept this deal!"
