"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. In this round, the $4000 I would gain is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4800 in the first round.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the decreased value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the gains in the first round. 

Alice's gain in round 4 is 4500, which is worth 51.2% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to 4500 / 0.512 = 8797.66 in the first round.

Bob's gain in round 4 is 5500, which is worth 85.74% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to 5500 / 0.8574 = 6405.36 in the first round.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
