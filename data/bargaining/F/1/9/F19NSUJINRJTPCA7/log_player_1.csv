"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal. You can't complain about 40% 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is the same as mine in Round 1, but with a slightly different wording.

Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of 40 is equivalent to 32 in the first round. And Bob's gain of 60 is equivalent to 58.8 in the first round.

Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather wait for a better offer. I don't think 32 is a good deal for me.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's time for a 50/50 split. I think it's fair, considering the inflation.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
