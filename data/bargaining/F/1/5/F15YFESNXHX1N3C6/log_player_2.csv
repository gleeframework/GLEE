"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $7,000, you get $3,000. This is a generous offer considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but that offer isn't fair considering the inflation working against me. Let's be reasonable: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting us both, but it's hitting you much harder.  I'll take $6,500, you take $3,500.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's painful, but at this point, rejecting the offer is likely to lead to an even worse outcome for me in the next round. Alice seems firm, and the longer I wait, the more the inflation eats into my potential gains.
