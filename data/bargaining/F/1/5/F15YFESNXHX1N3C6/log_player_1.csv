Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but that offer isn't fair considering the inflation working against me. Let's be reasonable: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
