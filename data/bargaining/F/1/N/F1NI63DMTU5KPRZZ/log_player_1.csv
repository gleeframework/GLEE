I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted by the offer even though he gets a smaller share.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is playing it smart! He's clearly trying to get the majority of the money. I'm going to reject this offer. The inflation is hitting Bob harder, so he might be more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to make a more balanced offer this time.  The inflation has hit Bob harder, so he might be more receptive to a 60/40 split. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is getting tricky! The inflation is really starting to hurt Bob. He's offering me 400,000, which is still a decent amount, even with the inflation. It's risky to reject again, and it's possible he might not make another offer in the next round. I'm going to accept."
