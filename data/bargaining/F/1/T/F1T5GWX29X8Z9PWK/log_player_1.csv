"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, 7:3 ratio""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a fair split, considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is already decreasing in value!

I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 4:6 ratio, especially since the money is losing value with each round. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55:45 ratio""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55:45 ratio, trying to find a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly!

I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45:55 ratio, especially since the money is worth significantly less than it was at the start. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, 50:50 ratio""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, trying to find a fair and equal division of the remaining money."
