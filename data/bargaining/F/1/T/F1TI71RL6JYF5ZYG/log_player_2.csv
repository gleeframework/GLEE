**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the time pressure and my previous ""final offer"" bluff.  While the deal is getting worse with each round, accepting this offer would mean letting her win most of the money. I'll hold out a bit longer and see if I can get her closer to a 50/50 split."
