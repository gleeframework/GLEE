"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get more money!

I'll reject this offer. The money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so it's not a good deal for me.
