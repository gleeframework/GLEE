"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob 40% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, it's a bit aggressive, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to adjust my offer to be a bit more favorable to myself, considering the inflation effect. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
