"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not too much! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still fair, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly higher percentage for myself, but still leaving room for a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of money, Bob's offer seems like a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his proposal.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
