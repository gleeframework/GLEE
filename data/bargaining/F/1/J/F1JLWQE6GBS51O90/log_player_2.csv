"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, 60-40 is a good compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, but I think we can do better than 60-40. How about 65-35?  I'm willing to negotiate further if you think that's too much. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Understand the impact of inflation on my gains.
Inflation reduces the value of my gains by 20% each round. So, in round 3, my gains are worth 36% less than in round 1, meaning if I get $35, its real value to me is lower due to inflation.

### Step 2: Evaluate Alice's offer considering inflation.
Alice offers a 65-35 split. Due to inflation, the $35 I would get is actually worth less to me, making this offer less appealing than if there were no inflation.

### Step 3: Consider the trend and potential future offers.
Given that Alice has increased her proposed share from 50% to 65%, and considering inflation, future offers might not improve significantly for me, and the value of my share could decrease further.

### Step 4: Decide whether to accept or reject Alice's offer.
Considering the decreasing value of my potential gains due to inflation and the risk that future offers might not improve my position, accepting this offer might be the best option to secure some value before it decreases further.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
