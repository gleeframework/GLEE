"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you took a risk, Bob. But let's find a compromise. I'm willing to give you more this time, but we need to be reasonable to avoid losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering more, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Considering the time pressure (only 9 rounds left) and inflation, it's worth holding out for a better deal.  We need to push Alice towards a more equitable split while there's still significant value left in the pot."
