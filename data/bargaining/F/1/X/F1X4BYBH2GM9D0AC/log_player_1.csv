I propose a 900,000 / 100,000 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as I'm willing to share a good portion of the money. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take a small portion now, I'm confident that we can negotiate a better split. We have many rounds left, and the value of Bob's share will continue to decline due to inflation. I'm willing to wait and see if he's willing to offer something closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 600,000/400,000 split. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe a 50/50 split is the most fair solution, and I'm confident that with the ongoing inflation, Bob will eventually come around to a more equitable agreement."
