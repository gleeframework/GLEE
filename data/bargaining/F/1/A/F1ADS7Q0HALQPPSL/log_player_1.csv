Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get 600,000 dollars and Bob gets 400,000 dollars."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of 450,000 dollars in this round is worth even less than in the previous round. I'll think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Taking into account the inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, hoping he'll accept."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation, my share of 475,000 dollars in this round is worth a lot less than in the first round. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower value...
