"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent starting point.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see if I can get a better deal. Even though this is a decent starting point, I think I can negotiate for more."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. This gives you a comfortable lead, while allowing me to get a significant share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can split this more evenly.  Let's aim for a 70/30 split, giving you a chance to build your share.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While I appreciate Alice's attempt to be more even, I'm still aiming for a larger share. I believe we can find a more balanced split that benefits both of us."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm sticking with my previous offer of a 60/40 split, but I'm willing to move a little to 55/45.  It's a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to go down to 65/35.  This is a fair split that takes into account inflation, and gives you a solid starting point.  Don't let this opportunity slip away! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I still think a 60/40 split would be more ideal, with each round passing, the value of the money decreases.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent share of the money, and I don't want to risk losing out on anything due to further inflation."
