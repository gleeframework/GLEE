"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, 50/50. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's just the first round, and I'm not in a hurry. Besides, with inflation, the money is still worth the same to me, but it's already 10% less valuable to Alice. Let's see what she comes up with next.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice. I'm excited to see her next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly in my favor, considering the inflation that affects Alice more than me.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice. I'm looking forward to her response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 45. Let's split it 47/53. 
# Bob gain: 53 
# Alice gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal, considering the inflation is affecting Alice more with each round. Her gain is now worth 19% less than in the first round, but mine remains unaffected.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what the next round brings. Please relay my decision to Alice.\n\n###\n\nI'm curious about her next move!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","With each round, the pressure increases on Alice due to inflation, while I remain unaffected. I'll try to leverage this by making an offer that's slightly more in my favor than before.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, isn't it?""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice. I'm eager to see how she responds to the increasing pressure of inflation.\n\n###\n\nLet's see if she'll accept this offer or if we'll continue negotiating!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm losing out with each round, but I'm still hoping we can find a fair split. Let's try 44/56. 
# Bob gain: 56 
# Alice gain: 44 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant impact of inflation on Alice's gain, which is now worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I think her offer is reasonable. The difference between her offer and my last proposal isn't substantial, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a risk of losing out entirely if we reach the 12th round without an agreement.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI believe accepting this offer is the prudent choice, given the circumstances. Please let Alice know that I accept her proposal.\n\n###\n\nIt seems we've reached a mutually acceptable agreement!"
