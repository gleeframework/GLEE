"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split.  It's a more even distribution, and we can avoid further devaluation of our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
