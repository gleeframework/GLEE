Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm now considering a 40% gain for myself. I'll think about Bob's offer...

I'll reject this offer for now.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my proposal for Round 3 is:
