Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, Alice, but I need to secure a better deal for myself. 70/30 is a more balanced split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
