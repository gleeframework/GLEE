"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob exactly half of the money, so we both end up with $500,000. I'm hoping this will be a straightforward and fair proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 70% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth 95% of the original $500,000, which is $475,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives me $475,000, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less in each of the two rounds), my offer will be adjusted accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can both get a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep the division relatively balanced."
