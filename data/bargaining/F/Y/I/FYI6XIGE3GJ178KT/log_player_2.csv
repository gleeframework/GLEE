"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous.  Let's start with a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While starting with a seemingly ""fair"" offer might sound good, the huge difference in gains combined with the rapid inflation for Alice means Bob can leverage a much better outcome by waiting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This accounts for the time pressure we both face.""} 

This offer is aggressive but justifiable. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice loses value much faster than Bob. Delaying is heavily in Bob's favor. 
* **Future Leverage:**  Rejecting Alice's low offer gives Bob more bargaining power in the next round.
* **Justification:**  The message is direct but not insulting. It highlights the objective reality of the situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a decent share. Let's work together. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is improving, but it's still not good for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation Favors Bob:**  Alice is feeling the heat of the rapidly devaluing money. Bob can afford to be patient.
* **Previous Leverage:** Bob's strong offer in Round 2 puts pressure on Alice to make a significantly better offer.
* **Potential for More:** By waiting another round, Bob can likely secure a deal closer to, if not exceeding, a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice.  The clock is ticking for both of us.""} 

**Strategy:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer is a slight concession from Bob's Round 2 offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but remaining firm on a favorable split. 
* **Time Pressure:** The message emphasizes the urgency, reminding Alice that delaying further significantly hurts her potential gain. 
* **Finality:**  By presenting it as a ""final offer,"" Bob creates a sense of urgency and increases the chance of Alice accepting to avoid risking even greater losses."
