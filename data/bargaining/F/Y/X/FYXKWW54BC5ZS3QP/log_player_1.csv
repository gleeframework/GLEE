"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, my gain of $450,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the previous round, while Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the previous round. This is a relatively good split for me, considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
