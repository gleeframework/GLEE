"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 70% and you can have 30%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and keep 60% for myself, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $400,000 is worth 90% of the original $400,000, which is $360,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 95% of the original $600,000, which is $570,000.

I'm not sure I like the terms of Bob's offer. I'd rather not give up that much. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain will be worth 81% of the original amount, and Bob's gain will be worth 90.25% of the original amount.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, a fair and equal division 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $500,000 is worth 72.9% of the original $1,000,000, which is $729,000. Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 85.74% of the original $1,000,000, which is $428,700.

I'm not sure I like the terms of Bob's offer. I'd rather have a higher share, considering the inflation has already reduced my gain by a significant amount. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.
