**Reasoning:** Alice is sticking close to her original offer and making very small concessions.  There are still many rounds left for me to push for a better deal.  It's risky, but I think I can get closer to a 50/50 split or at least a significantly better offer than this."

# Alice's message: Time is indeed running out, let's settle on 56-44, it's the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to pressure me with the time limit, but I'm sticking to my strategy. Her concessions are minimal, and I believe I can still get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  Even a slight improvement on my last offer would be a win at this point."
