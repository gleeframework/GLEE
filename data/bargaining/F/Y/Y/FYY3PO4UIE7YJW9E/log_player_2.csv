"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice is offering me a very small share, and I know the money will be worth less in the next round. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to share more, but I need a better cut than the last offer. Let's split it more evenly.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 70/30, which is more even than our last offers.  We're losing money with each round, so let's find a solution quickly. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a better deal than the previous round, and the money is losing value quickly. It's a good compromise to avoid losing more."
