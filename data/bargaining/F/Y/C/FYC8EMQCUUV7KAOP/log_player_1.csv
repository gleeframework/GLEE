"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but that offer was heavily skewed.  Let's be reasonable: I'm proposing a more balanced split this round. This accounts for the time value of money for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
