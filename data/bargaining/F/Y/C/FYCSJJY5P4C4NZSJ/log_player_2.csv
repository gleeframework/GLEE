**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I'm running out of time. I need to push for a more advantageous split before inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer, now I'm going up 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot. While Alice is getting greedier, I'm running out of time. Accepting this offer will net me less than my previous proposal, but rejecting it means risking an even worse deal with each passing round.  It's a gamble, but I need to cut my losses before inflation completely eats away my potential gain."
