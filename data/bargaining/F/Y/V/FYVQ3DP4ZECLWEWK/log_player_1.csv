Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a split that works better for both of us. Since the money depreciates faster for you, I'm offering you a smaller share, but one that still keeps things relatively fair. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
