"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value for me faster. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair in terms of the initial value, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself, considering the inflation rate is less for me. I'll reject the offer and see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can find a split that works better for both of us. Since the money depreciates faster for you, I'm offering you a smaller share, but one that still keeps things relatively fair. Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but your offer significantly undervalues my position.  I'm willing to compromise, but this split needs to be more equitable. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I still believe I could negotiate for more, it's getting late in the game. Alice's offer is now closer to a 50/50 split after accounting for inflation, and it seems like a good compromise. Accepting this deal ensures we both get something, rather than risking getting nothing at all if we continue to haggle."
