"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split it evenly and end this. It's only going to get worse for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
At this point, accepting is the best option.  While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is eating into my potential gains each round. A 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
