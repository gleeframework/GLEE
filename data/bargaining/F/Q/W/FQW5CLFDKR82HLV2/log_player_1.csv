"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 90/10.  It's a fair deal, considering I'm the one taking the risk of inflation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic: I propose a 60/40 split. This recognizes the impact inflation has on your share, giving you a good deal now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
