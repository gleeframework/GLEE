"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation factor and Bob's previous proposal, I suggest a 55/45 split in our favor. This maintains a reasonable balance while acknowledging the value decrease for Bob's portion. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
