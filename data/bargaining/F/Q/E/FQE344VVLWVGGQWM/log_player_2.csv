Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  The value of this deal diminishes for you with every passing round.  Take this offer while it's still worthwhile.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share. This deal is still significantly unfair. Let's try to find a more balanced solution.  
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, and the time pressure is on.  While I could push for a higher amount, there's a real risk that negotiations could break down entirely. Accepting ensures I get a significant share, even if it's not the absolute maximum I could have aimed for.
