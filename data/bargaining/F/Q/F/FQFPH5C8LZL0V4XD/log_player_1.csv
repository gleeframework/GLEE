"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money in terms of its original value.

The offer from Bob is to give me $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. This is a better offer than my previous one, and it's a fair split. I'll accept it.
