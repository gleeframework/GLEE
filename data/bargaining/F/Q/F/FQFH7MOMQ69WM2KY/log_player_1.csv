"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the numbers are:

Alice gain: 300,000 * 0.95 = 285,000
Bob gain: 700,000 * 0.95 = 665,000

I'm not too thrilled with this offer. I'd rather not give up that much. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. This is a 55-45 split, which I think is a more reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less, the numbers are:

Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.8534 = 383,518
Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.8534 = 469,385

It looks like Bob's offer is similar to the one he made in Round 2, but with slightly adjusted numbers. I'm still not thrilled with giving up that much. I'll reject it.

}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
