Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  It's a good starting point, and if he rejects it, I'll have to adjust my offer to be more competitive in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, this is a much better deal than the one I offered in the first round. Accepting is the best option."
