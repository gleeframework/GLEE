"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's see if we can agree on this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is worth less to him, but still a good compromise. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
