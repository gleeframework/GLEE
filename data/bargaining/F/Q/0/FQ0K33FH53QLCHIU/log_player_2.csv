"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk to start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we both need to account for. Let's agree and move on.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to give you a larger share this time.  We can still get a decent amount each if we agree. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to accept this offer. With each passing round, the inflation will eat away at the value of the money, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal."
