"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 and the game is over!"

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you still have to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decision.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to accept an offer that gives me less than half of the total amount. I'll try to do better next round!"

I'll think about it...
