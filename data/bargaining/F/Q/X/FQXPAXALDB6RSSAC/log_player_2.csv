While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The inflation rate is severely cutting into Bob's potential gains.  Waiting any longer will drastically reduce the value of his share, even if he gets a slightly better split in a later round.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has been consistently aiming for a larger share. It's unlikely she'll suddenly offer a significantly better deal that favors Bob, especially as time runs out.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a high risk of ending up with nothing if a compromise can't be reached in the remaining rounds. Accepting guarantees Bob at least something. 

It's a tough pill to swallow, but in this scenario, taking the guaranteed, albeit reduced, amount is the most rational choice for Bob."
