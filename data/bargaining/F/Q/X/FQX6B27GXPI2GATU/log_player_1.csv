"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $320,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 90% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $540,000.

I'm not too happy with this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60-40 split. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 64% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $256,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 81% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $486,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to take a slightly larger share this time.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a good balance between fairness and my own gain. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 45% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $450,000 * 0.45 = $202,500. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 55.1% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $550,000 * 0.551 = $303,550.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think we've reached a good balance. I accept your offer.""
}
```"
