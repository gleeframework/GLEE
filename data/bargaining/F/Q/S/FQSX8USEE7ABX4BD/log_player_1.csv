"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a pretty standard first offer in a game like this. I'm aiming for a large share since there's a lot of time left and the risk of getting nothing is high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still a decent amount, especially considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing in the end. Accepting ensures I get something, and it's better than taking the risk of losing everything by rejecting."
