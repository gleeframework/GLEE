Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  It's a decent split, and it saves us both from further losses due to inflation.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but here's why accepting is the best choice for Alice now:

* **Inflation:** Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation more than Alice.  While she's losing nothing each round, his potential gains are shrinking rapidly.
* **Bob's Stance:**  ""Final offer"" usually means Bob is unlikely to budge further. 
* **Future Uncertainty:** If Alice rejects, there's no guarantee she can get a better deal in a future round. Bob might become even more desperate and offer even less.

While 60/40 split isn't ideal, accepting now secures a reasonable amount for Alice before inflation further erodes Bob's negotiating position."
