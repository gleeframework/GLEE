"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal. I'll accept it.
