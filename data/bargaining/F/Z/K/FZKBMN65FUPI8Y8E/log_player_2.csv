"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:2 in favor of Alice. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a more even split. Let's go 5500 for me, 4500 for you. It's a fair starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the rejection of my previous offer and the impact of inflation, I propose we divide the money 55:45 in favor of Bob. This should be a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split,  accepting this offer is a better outcome than risking further rounds and potential inflation."
