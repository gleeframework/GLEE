Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is hurting both of us, and a 50/50 split seems fairest given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll take the 50/50 split. Further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for me."
