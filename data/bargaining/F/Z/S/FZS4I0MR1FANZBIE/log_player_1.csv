"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60. It's a fair starting point, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment... Since the money is worth less for Bob, he's trying to make up for it by offering a slightly larger share. I'll consider it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Maybe I can get a better deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the fact that the money is worth less for Bob with each passing round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering a slight adjustment to the previous round's offer, but still trying to get a slightly larger share."
