"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept an even split. I know the money is worth less to Alice each round, so I can hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm still willing to split it fairly.  60 for me, 40 for you.  Accept this and we're done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I understand you want more, but I'm not going to let you take advantage of me. 55 for me, 45 for you.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher split, I'm happy to take 45. Alice's offer is better than what she would have gotten if she'd accepted my offer in round 2, and it's still a decent amount for me."
