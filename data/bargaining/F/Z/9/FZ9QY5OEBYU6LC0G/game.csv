75.0,25.0,I propose we divide the money in a 3:1 ratio. This seems fair given the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I understand your concern about diminishing value, it's important to acknowledge that your money depreciates at a faster rate than mine. This offer ensures we both get a significant share of the money, and we can avoid the risk of losing everything in subsequent rounds.",Bob,2,
