"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I understand your concern about diminishing value, it's important to acknowledge that your money depreciates at a faster rate than mine. This offer ensures we both get a significant share of the money, and we can avoid the risk of losing everything in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
