Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I understand your concern about diminishing value, it's important to acknowledge that your money depreciates at a faster rate than mine. This offer ensures we both get a significant share of the money, and we can avoid the risk of losing everything in subsequent rounds.""
