"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to keep the game interesting.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he declines!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, but I think I deserve a bit more than 30% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 20% less now, so I'll be getting $300,000 instead of $360,000 (90% of $400,000, which is 80% of $1,000,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 70% of the remaining amount, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
