"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move forward."
