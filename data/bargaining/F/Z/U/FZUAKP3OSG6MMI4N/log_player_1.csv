"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less for me in each subsequent round. I figure Bob is likely to accept this offer, as getting $1 is better than getting nothing if we continue playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation makes it clear that I'm unlikely to get a better offer in the future.  Getting $400,000 is better than waiting and potentially getting less."
