Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but let's be fair.  Since you'll be taking a bigger hit on inflation, I'm taking the majority.  Hopefully, we can end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
