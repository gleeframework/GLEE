"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30.  It's a good offer for you to start with. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation penalty for me is a consideration, but I think I can get a better deal than $30."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! This offer is better than what you'll get if you decline and face further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly better than the first one, considering the inflation, I think I can still negotiate for a more favorable deal. The 9.75% decrease in value for me makes every dollar count even more. I'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get a better deal. This is as high as I'm willing to go.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for Alice's response."
