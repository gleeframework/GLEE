"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money if I can!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 to start 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation setting in, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one taking the risk!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still holding out for more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is being stubborn, but I'm not giving up yet! With the money losing value due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
