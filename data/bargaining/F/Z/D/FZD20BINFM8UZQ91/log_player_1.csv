"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 475000/525000 split. This is based on the decreasing value of money due to inflation. I believe this is a fair distribution considering the diminishing returns. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
