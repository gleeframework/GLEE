**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of Bob's potential gains is decreasing significantly with each round (now down 27.1%). This makes it less likely he'll offer a better deal in the future.
* **Bob's Stance:** His language (""final offer,"" ""meet me halfway"") suggests he's getting close to his lower limit.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk. If we fail to reach an agreement in subsequent rounds, we both lose, and the potential gains diminish further. 

Accepting a 55/45 split isn't perfect, but it secures a reasonable amount of money and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
