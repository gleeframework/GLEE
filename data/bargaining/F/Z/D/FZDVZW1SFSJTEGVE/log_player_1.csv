"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer more money, the inflation means that my potential gains in the next round will be even lower. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
