"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer gives me a large share, but it's important to remember that the game is about *division*. Offering Bob a tiny amount might make him more likely to reject the deal, which could lead to both of us getting nothing.  I'm hoping this small gesture will encourage him to accept and avoid further rounds where the value of the money could be eroded."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, even taking inflation into account.  There's no way I'm going to accept getting only $1 while he gets almost everything. I'll take my chances with the next round and see if I can negotiate a more reasonable split."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

This offer is still heavily in my favor, but I'm willing to give Bob a significantly larger share than before. My reasoning is this: 

* **Previous Rounds:**  The last two rounds have shown Bob is willing to be aggressive in his demands, even if it means risking getting nothing.
* **Future Rounds:** By offering a more ""fair"" split, I hope to incentivize him to accept the offer and avoid further rounds where the value of the money can decrease for both of us.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Offering a decent amount to Bob is a calculated risk, but it reduces the chance of the game ending with both of us getting nothing.

I believe this offer balances my desire for a large share with a reasonable chance of acceptance."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than his previous proposal, it still feels very unfair.  He's offering me a mere $100,000 while taking nearly 90% of the money for himself. I'm not going to accept such a lopsided split. It's time to make my own offer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This offer represents a significant concession from my previous offers, but it's still in my favor. The reasoning behind this shift is:

* **Bob's Aggression:**  Bob's continued rejections and increasingly lopsided offers show he's not afraid to gamble and risk getting nothing. 
* **Risk of Loss:**  We're nearing the midpoint of the game.  If we don't reach an agreement soon, the inflation will dramatically affect the value of the money for both of us.
* **Finding Common Ground:** This offer is a middle ground where I retain a decent share, but also offer Bob a substantial amount, hoping to appeal to his desire for a large portion of the pie.

I believe this offer is balanced enough to entice Bob to accept while still ensuring I receive a fair portion of the money."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more equal split, it still feels unfair.  He's demanding 60% of the money while offering me only 40%. It's clear that we need to find a more balanced approach to this division.  I'm not going to settle for such a low share when I believe we can find a better solution.  I'll continue to play strategically and see if we can come to an agreement before the inflation makes this entire process pointless."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This offer represents a true 50/50 split, offering Bob an equal share of the remaining money.  I've come to realize that continuing to fight for a larger share risks losing everything.  The inflation is a serious threat, and it's clear that we need to compromise to ensure we both get something.  I hope this equal division will finally convince Bob to accept and end the game, as we're getting dangerously close to the deadline."
