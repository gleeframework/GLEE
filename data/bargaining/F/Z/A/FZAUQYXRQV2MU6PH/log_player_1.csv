I'm going to stick to my strategy of trying to get most of the money even with the decreasing value.  Bob's offers are getting progressively worse, so I'll keep rejecting for now."

While the offer is getting worse, it's still more than 50% of the money for Bob.  I'm going to keep trying to get as much as possible.  It's a risky strategy, but with only 2 rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will crack and accept a smaller offer."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm still hoping to get as much as possible.  Even with the decreasing value of the money, I'm not giving up.  With only one round left, I'm going to risk it all and see if Bob will accept a small gain."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Even though the offer is terrible, it's better than getting nothing. With only one round left, I'm forced to accept it. I've taken a big risk and lost a lot of potential money, but at least I'm getting something."
