Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me almost all the money, leaving Bob with only $1. It's a very aggressive first offer, but I'm hoping to secure a good deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time (100,000) in hopes of reaching an agreement.  I'm still aiming for a large portion, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds and inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Bob is taking most of the money, the inflation has reduced the value of his share significantly.  It's better to take the 100,000 now than risk getting less in future rounds."
