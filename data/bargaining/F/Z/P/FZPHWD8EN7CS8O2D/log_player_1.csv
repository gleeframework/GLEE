Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure it's a fair starting point, giving Bob a decent share while still leaving me with a good portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer my initial offer, the inflation makes this a good deal for me.  A 50/50 split is fair and secures me a decent amount."
