"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the larger share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's start with a fair 50-50 split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4750.

I'll consider Bob's proposal. A 50-50 split is a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round with a smaller share.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
