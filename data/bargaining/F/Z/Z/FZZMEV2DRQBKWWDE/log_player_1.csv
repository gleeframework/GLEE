{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in your favor. I figure you'll be happy with a good chunk of the money, and since I'm the one taking the risk of rejection in this round, I'm hoping you'll see it as a fair starting point."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering a 6000/4000 split. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a majority share given Bob's rejection of my initial offer."

Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a larger share. I've already rejected two of his offers, and the inflation is hurting him more than me at this point. I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm increasing my offer to 7000/3000. We're getting closer to the end, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still aiming for a majority."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable. While I'm aware of the inflation, I'm still confident in my ability to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going for a 8000/2000 split this round. Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse, and I'm hoping he'll realize it's in his best interest to accept a smaller share rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is far too lopsided in Bob's favor. Despite the inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round. I'll continue to fight for a more fair split."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split. This is a significant increase from my previous offer. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value in accepting a smaller share rather than risking getting nothing at all."
