Let's see if I can get a better deal!  I'm not sure how the inflation affects Alice, but I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  It's fair, and hopefully, Alice sees the value in that.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm hoping that it's not enough to make Alice overly aggressive in her counter-offers."
