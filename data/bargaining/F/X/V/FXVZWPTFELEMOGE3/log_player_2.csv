# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the 10% decrease in value for Alice, I might be able to get a better deal."

# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Since Alice's gain is depreciating faster, I can try to negotiate for an even better split in the next round."

# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Since Alice's gain is depreciating significantly (34.39% less than the initial value), I believe I can negotiate for an even better split in the next round. The pressure is on Alice to settle, so I'll try to take advantage of that."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 575000, ""alice_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Considering the substantial depreciation of your share, I'm willing to take a larger portion. This is a final offer, as further negotiations will only decrease your share's value.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's clear you are trying to maximize your gain, but if I don't get a reasonable amount, we both walk away with nothing.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant depreciation of Alice's share, her offer of 52/48 is reasonable. Since she stated it's her final offer, and I've pushed my luck in previous rounds, I'll accept this offer to ensure I get a substantial amount rather than risking further negotiations that might lead to an impasse."
