"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal. I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer rather than risking a decrease in value due to inflation. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is fair. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer may seem fair at first glance, I need to consider the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, accepting this offer would mean I'm getting less value than if we had split it evenly in the first round. I'm willing to take the risk and make another proposal in the next round to try and get a better deal. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last one. Think about it!""}

I'm hoping that Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer, as it still gives me a larger share but takes into account the loss of value due to inflation. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation by offering me a significantly lower share than what I previously proposed. Considering the effects of inflation, accepting this offer would mean I'm getting an even worse deal than before. I'm not willing to settle for that, so I'll reject this offer and make another proposal in the next round to try and get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. However, I'll also take into account that Bob's previous offer was quite biased in his favor, so I won't be too generous.

{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the circumstances.""}

I'm hoping that Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer, as it still gives me a larger share but takes into account the loss of value due to inflation and is more balanced than his previous offer. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my last offer. Let's meet halfway. 
# Alice gain: 430000 
# Bob gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is not willing to budge from his previous offer, which is still not favorable to me. Considering the effects of inflation, accepting this offer would mean I'm getting an even worse deal than before. However, I also need to consider that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and if we don't reach an agreement soon, we might both end up with nothing.

In this case, I'll have to weigh my options carefully. Since Bob's offer is not ideal, but the alternative is risking further devaluation, I'll have to make a tough decision.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best deal I can get under the circumstances."
