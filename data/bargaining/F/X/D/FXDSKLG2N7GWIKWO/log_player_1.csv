"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still trying to get a decent share for myself. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money's value decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than it initially seems.
