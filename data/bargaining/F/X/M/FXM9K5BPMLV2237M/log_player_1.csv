"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor. I want to maximize my share early on before the inflation takes effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than what I would have received in the first round. However, it's still early in the game, and I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly from the first round. I believe that Bob will be more inclined to accept a larger share this time, considering the inflation factor and the fact that he rejected my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to take its toll, and Bob's offer is getting closer to what I was originally aiming for. I'm willing to accept this offer and secure some of the money before the inflation continues to erode my potential gains."
