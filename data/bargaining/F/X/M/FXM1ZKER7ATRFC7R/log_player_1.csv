"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We can both benefit from this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh?

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. If we split it evenly, I'll get $50, which is worth 80% of the original $50 (since it's 20% less due to inflation).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
