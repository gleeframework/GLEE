I propose taking $999,999 and giving Bob $1. This is to ensure that we both get something, but to maximize my gains. I anticipate Bob will reject this offer and propose something more even."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is the same offer as I made in round 1, just reversed. I will reject this offer, and propose again in round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose an even split of $500,000 each. This seems like the fairest and most logical way to divide the money, as we both have an equal chance of proposing and rejecting offers."
