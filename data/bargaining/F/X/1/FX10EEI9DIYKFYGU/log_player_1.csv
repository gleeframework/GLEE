I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the one making the first offer.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer. Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation. Let's see if he'll come down on his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750}

I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still confident in my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't accept a deal that gives me less than 50%. Let's see if he'll come down on his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  With inflation increasing, it's clear that a fair division is the only way to ensure both of us get a reasonable share.  Let's end this game fairly."
