350000.0,650000.0,"That's a very generous offer, Alice, but I think we can make this a bit more equitable. How about a 65/35 split in my favor?  It reflects that I'm taking on more risk with the inflation.",Bob,2,

450000.0,550000.0,"I appreciate you moving towards a more balanced split, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?  The inflation is hitting me harder, and this seems like a fair compromise.",Bob,4,
