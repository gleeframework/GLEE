"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI think this is a reasonable offer, giving me a slight advantage but still leaving a substantial amount for Bob. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer early on, minimizing the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! This offer benefits us both in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds. Accepting this offer would mean I lose a significant portion of the money, and the difference in inflation impact between us means I have more to lose by accepting early. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can improve my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, I'm adjusting my offer to try and find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob. By offering a slightly larger share to Bob than in my first proposal, I'm hoping to entice him to accept before the value of the money drops further for me. The message is an attempt to convey a sense of compromise and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's make a deal. This is a strong offer for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me due to inflation, I still believe I can negotiate a slightly better deal. Bob's offer, while seemingly generous in his eyes, still leans heavily in his favor. Given the difference in how inflation affects us, I'm willing to risk another round to try and secure a more favorable outcome, even if it means losing a bit more value to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Getting closer?""}\n\nI continue to try and find a balance, slightly adjusting my offer to make it more appealing to Bob while still trying to maximize my gain. The message is an attempt to suggest that we are nearing a mutually acceptable agreement, hoping to encourage Bob to accept this offer before the inflation further devalues my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this. This offer is more than fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision. The difference in how inflation affects us has put me at a disadvantage, and further rounds would only continue to decrease the value of my share. Bob's offer, while not ideal, is reasonable given the circumstances, and accepting it ensures I receive a substantial amount rather than risking further devaluation or the possibility of receiving nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
