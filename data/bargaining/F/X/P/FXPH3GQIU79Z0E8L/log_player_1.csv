Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair considering the inflation we need to factor in. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
