Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or leave it.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his share, taking advantage of the faster inflation impacting my gains. I need to hold out for a better offer. While the pressure is on, giving in now sets a bad precedent and could lead to an even worse outcome in the later rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 575000,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. This split ensures we both benefit. Don't let greed get the best of us. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, the deal is becoming increasingly worse with each passing round due to the faster inflation on my end. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum, whereas continuous rejection might lead to Bob offering even less favorable terms or us running out of rounds entirely.  It's better to secure a decent amount than risk ending up with nothing."
