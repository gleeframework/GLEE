While the offer is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is becoming a major factor.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a decent amount rather than risk losing everything."
