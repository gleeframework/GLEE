"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the money I gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so the effective value of my gain in Round 2 is 0.95 * 6000 = 5700.

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as it's a very uneven split. I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 10% decrease in value due to two rounds of inflation (5% each), the money I gain is worth 0.95^2 * 6000 = 5295.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
