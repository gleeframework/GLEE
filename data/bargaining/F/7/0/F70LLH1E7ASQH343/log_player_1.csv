"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, splitting the $100 evenly between us. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take into account the inflation that's happening.  How about we split it 60/40?  That way we both get a little more than half. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is fair, considering I'm the one who proposed the initial 50/50 split and he rejected it. I think I should get a better deal now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account that the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split. It's not too far off from 50/50, but it gives me a bit more to account for the loss in value.""
}
