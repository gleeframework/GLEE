"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given the inflation dynamics we need to consider.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic move. Given the inflation rates, the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round, and waiting for another proposal is not in my best interest.  Accepting the offer ensures I still get a decent portion of the money, and it avoids the risk of losing even more value in subsequent rounds."
