"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems like a fair split at first glance, the game is about maximizing my gains.  Since I have the opportunity to make an offer in the next round, I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 
Let's see if Alice is willing to accept a deal that gives me a larger share.  After all, I have to compensate for the inflation she'll face in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation and decrease my share. While I'm losing out on a potential gain by rejecting her offer, I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round.  It's important to stand firm and hold out for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to offer an even split this time.  This is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the inflation Alice is facing, while still providing a fair outcome for both of us.  It's a good strategy to make a reasonable offer that shows willingness to negotiate but still favors my interests."
