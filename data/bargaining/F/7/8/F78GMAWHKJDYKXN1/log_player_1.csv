"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, let's try 7-3 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, Bob is offering me $300,000, which is worth the same as my initial offer, but now the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than the initial offer. I'll have to think carefully about this...

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to try to meet Bob halfway, but still slightly favoring myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is getting closer, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept yet. I'll think about it...

Actually, I'll accept this offer. The numbers are very close to my previous offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
