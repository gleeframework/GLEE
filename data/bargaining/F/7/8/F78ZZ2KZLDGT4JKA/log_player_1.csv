Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, aiming to secure a deal early on.  I'll give Bob $10, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not happy about getting only 20%, it's better than nothing, especially considering the inflation. Accepting this means we don't risk further losses due to inflation."
