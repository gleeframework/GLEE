"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

This way, I get 70% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since I'm getting 40% of the remaining value, which is less than what I initially proposed, I'll decide to reject this offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This way, I'm aiming for a slightly better share, but not too greedy, considering the reduced value of the money."
