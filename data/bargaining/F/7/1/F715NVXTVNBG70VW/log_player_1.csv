"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to give myself $90 and Bob $10. This is a relatively small amount for me, so I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair split is a good start, but I want more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 20% less than before, so I'm now considering a gain of $72 (90 * 0.8) instead of $90.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 50% of the remaining money, but I'm also not eager to wait for more rounds and risk losing more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
