Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I need to secure a larger share upfront due to the inflation. This offer still leaves you with a decent amount.

# Alice gain: 6400

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, but the value decreases with each passing round for me.  
# Bob gain: 3400 
# Alice gain: 6600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which means my position is getting stronger. I'm willing to risk it for another round or two to try and secure a better deal. While I want to avoid getting nothing, it seems like Alice is feeling the pressure more than me right now."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is the best I can do. You're right, we're running out of time, and this is a fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's settle this now and both walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I'm pushing my luck a bit, I want to capitalize on Alice's fear of losing everything. By offering the same split she initially proposed, I'm hoping she'll see it as a reasonable compromise given the time pressure and the impact of inflation on her share. It's a gamble, but the potential reward of a slightly better outcome outweighs the risk of getting nothing at this stage."
