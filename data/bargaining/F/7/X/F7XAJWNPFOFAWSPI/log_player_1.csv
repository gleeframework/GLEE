"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory problem. I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I'm assuming Bob is rational and will take the $1, rather than risk getting nothing in subsequent rounds.  We'll see how it plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is extremely unfair, I have to accept.  My gains are rapidly depreciating due to inflation, and if I reject this offer, I run the risk of getting nothing at all in subsequent rounds. It's a tough choice, but accepting is the only rational strategy given the circumstances."
