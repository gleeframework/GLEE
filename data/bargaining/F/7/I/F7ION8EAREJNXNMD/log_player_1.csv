"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, you can't do better than that!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly. It's fair and simple. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $50 is actually worth 80% of the original $60 I would have gotten in Round 1.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I was hoping to get a better deal than splitting it evenly. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I want more than 50, I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so my gain is worth 64% of the original $60 I would have gotten in Round 1. Let's calculate my gain for Round 3:

$60 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $38.4

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 38,
  ""bob_gain"": 62,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 62, take it or leave it!""
}
```"
