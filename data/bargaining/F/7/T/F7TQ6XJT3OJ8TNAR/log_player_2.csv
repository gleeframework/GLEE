# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is heavily underestimating the impact of inflation on her own gains. While her offer seems like a compromise, it's heavily skewed in her favor when considering the rapidly devaluing money.  We need to push her closer to a more even split while we still have leverage."
