"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount and can still negotiate further if we want to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small lead, but still a fair share for you 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 30$ is now worth less than 24$ (since 20% of 30 is 6, and 30 - 6 = 24). Not a great deal for me!

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 60% of 100), I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger lead, but still a decent share for you 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is catching up!

Since my 60$ in the first round is now worth 31.2$ (100 - 48.8% = 51.2% of 60), my 20$ in this round is worth around 10.24$. Not a great deal for me!

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is getting scarcer! Since my 31.2$ from the previous round is now worth 16.64$ (51.2% of 32.4% of 60), I'll aim to get a decent share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```"
