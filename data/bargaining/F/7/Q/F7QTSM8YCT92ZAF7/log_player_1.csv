"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We can work together to get a good outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","An even split is a good starting point, but I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, can we discuss a 55-45 split?""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept the even split just yet, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A 55-45 split seems fair, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a relatively even split. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
