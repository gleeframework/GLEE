"Round 1

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject the offer.  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $4000, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Since the money is worth less to Alice each round, I may be able to convince her to give me more."

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is slightly better than her first offer, but I'm still going to reject it. The money is worth less to her with each round, so I'm hoping I can convince her to give me a bigger share later."

I'm still going to reject the offer.  Even though Alice's share is decreasing more rapidly, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to continue to press for a larger share as the game goes on."
