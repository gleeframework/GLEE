"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, my share of $300,000 is now worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 times its original value, which is $243,000.

Bob's share of $700,000 is now worth 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 times its original value, which is $631,750.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
