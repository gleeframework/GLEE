# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While the deal is getting worse, I still have seven rounds before I get nothing. It's time to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - I'm serious.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With seven rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting, but it's important to appear decisive.
* **Strategic Concession:** Offering Alice 5500 is a slight concession that might seem appealing given her previous offers.
* **Firm Language:**  Using strong language like ""final offer"" might push Alice to accept before the deal worsens for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging much, and my position is getting worse with each round. Accepting 3500 now is better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds.  It's not ideal, but it's the best I can realistically hope for at this point."
