"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me. It's worth rejecting and seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation hurts you more, but this split is more reflective of the shrinking pot.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the Lead:** I'm taking the initiative to steer the negotiation in my favor.
* **Acknowledging Inflation:** My message acknowledges the inflation disparity, showing I'm not entirely dismissive of Alice's position.
* **Strategic Offer:** This offer is a significant jump for me (from $400,000 to $550,000) but still leaves Alice with a reasonable sum.  The message emphasizes that the deal gets worse for both of us as time goes on.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation in subsequent rounds if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the uneven inflation impact, I've adjusted. Let's settle! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, her offer has decreased significantly. This indicates I have leverage.
* **Strategic Calculation:** While my potential gain is shrinking, accepting $420,000 now is still worse than holding out for a potential $500,000+ in the next few rounds, even with the inflation. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  Rejecting keeps the pressure on Alice and might encourage her to make a more desperate offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer - time is running out, and we both lose if we don't agree soon.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of Urgency:**  With each round, the value of the money diminishes significantly. Creating a sense of urgency is crucial.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my demand slightly from $550,000 to $520,000, making it more appealing for Alice.
* **Finality:**  By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I'm applying pressure on Alice to accept before the deal potentially gets much worse for her. 
* **Psychological Impact:**  The fear of losing everything might push Alice to accept a deal that, while not ideal, is still better than nothing."
