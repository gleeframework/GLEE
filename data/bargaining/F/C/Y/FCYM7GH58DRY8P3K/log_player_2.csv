Let's see if I can get a better deal. ðŸ˜‰"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance for 50/50, now it's my turn 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is worse than my initial proposal, it's still better than getting nothing in the end. It's time to be practical!"
