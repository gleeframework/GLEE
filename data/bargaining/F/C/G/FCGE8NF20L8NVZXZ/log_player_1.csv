"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $100 equally, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a decent offer! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about giving up the majority of the money, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll still get $40, which is a decent amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
