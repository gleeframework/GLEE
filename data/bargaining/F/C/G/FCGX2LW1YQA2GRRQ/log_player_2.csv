Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 50/50 split.  We both get half.  This seems fairer to both of us, and it avoids further losses with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
