"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving Bob with 40 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to decide. Since I'm getting less value out of the same amount of money, I'll have to be more cautious. The offer is still a bit skewed towards Bob, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% inflation that has reduced the value of the money. Since I want to get a better deal, I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You were close, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

This time, I'm offering to take 55 dollars and leaving Bob with 45 dollars. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
