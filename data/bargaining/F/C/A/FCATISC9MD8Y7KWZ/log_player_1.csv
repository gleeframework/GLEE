"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, as we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less this round, the actual amounts would be:

* Bob's offer: $40 (my gain) + $60 (his gain) = $100
* But due to inflation, the actual value is 80% of that, so $80

I'm not thrilled about getting only $40, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting even less. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
