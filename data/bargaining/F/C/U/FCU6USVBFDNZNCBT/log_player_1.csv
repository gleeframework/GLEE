"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 70% of 80% of $100 = 0.7 * 0.8 * $100 = $56
Bob's gain: 30% of 80% of $100 = 0.3 * 0.8 * $100 = $24

I'll accept Bob's offer.
