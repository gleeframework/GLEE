"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering a very lopsided split, hoping to secure the deal quickly while inflation hasn't had much effect yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While I would have preferred to get more, the inflation rate is already making a difference.  A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer."
