"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of 20 is equivalent to 25 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd like to try to get a better deal, but I don't want to risk going too low and giving Bob too much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my gain of 25 in the first round is now equivalent to 20 in the second round, and equivalent to 16 in the third round.

I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need 25 to make it worth my while!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 75, which is a significant amount, but I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to compromise and give him a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of 16 in the third round is now equivalent to 8.48 in the fourth round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the idea of taking only 10, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'd rather not give Bob 90% of the remaining money, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of 8.48 in the fourth round is now equivalent to 4.43 in the fifth round.

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the diminishing value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to get something substantial out of this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 60, which is a relatively equal split, but I'm hoping he'll see that I'm trying to salvage what's left of the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being stubborn, I'll try to get the majority! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Since the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, my gain of 4.43 in the fifth round is now equivalent to 1.44 in the sixth round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the idea of taking only 5, but I'm starting to get desperate. I'd rather not give Bob 95% of the remaining money, but I'll consider it.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, my gain of 1.44 in the sixth round is now equivalent to 0.45 in the seventh round.

I'll try to make a more desperate offer this time, considering the extremely low value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 10,
  ""bob_gain"": 90,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, take 90 and let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 90, which is a huge concession, but I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to give in and end the game."
