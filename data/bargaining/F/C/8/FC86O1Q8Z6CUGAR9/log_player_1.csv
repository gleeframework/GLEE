Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I lose a significant amount of money compared to my initial offer, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the following rounds. Inflation is a big factor, and I'm not sure how it will affect Bob's offers in the future."
