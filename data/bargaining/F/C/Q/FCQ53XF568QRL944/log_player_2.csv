"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40.  We can discuss more in later rounds if you want. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Reasoning: While the offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Bob in later rounds. It makes sense to see if Alice is willing to offer a better deal as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I understand you wanting the larger share, but the inflation makes it difficult. How about we switch it up this round?""
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Strong Counter:** By mirroring Alice's offer, Bob puts the ball back in her court and emphasizes the disadvantageous inflation she faces.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's initial offer while firmly suggesting a more beneficial arrangement for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone suggests this isn't a final offer, leaving room for Alice to counter-propose as the rounds progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hurting us both.  Let's compromise. I'll take 55, you take 45. This way, we both get a fair share, and we don't risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Reasoning: 

* **Inflation Advantage:** The decreasing value of money continues to work in Bob's favor more than Alice's. This means time is on Bob's side to push for a better deal.
* **Minor Concession:**  Alice's offer is only a slight improvement from her first. She's clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but not enough to offer a significantly better deal for Bob. 
* **Calculated Risk:** While there's a risk Alice might not budge much, Bob can afford to play a slightly riskier game due to the advantageous inflation rates. A rejection increases pressure on Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a solution soon. The inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a 65/35 split.  This factors in the faster devaluation you face.""
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Increased Demand:**  Bob ups his demand to 65%, reflecting the urgency of the situation and his increasingly favorable position. 
* **Justification:** The message explicitly links the offer to the inflation, making it clear to Alice that this isn't arbitrary but a response to the game's mechanics.
* **Finality:** While still open to negotiation, the tone becomes slightly more urgent, signaling that Bob is getting closer to a point where he might hold out for a very favorable deal or even risk it all."
