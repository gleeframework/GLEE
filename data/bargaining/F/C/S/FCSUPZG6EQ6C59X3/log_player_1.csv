"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, the values are now:

* My gain: $300,000
* Bob's gain: $700,000

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's a 70/30 split in Bob's favor. I'll try to do better next round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can finish this game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to find a compromise that's more favorable to me than the previous offer. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the values are now:

* My gain: $450,000
* Bob's gain: $550,000

This offer is still a 50.5/49.5 split, which is very close to a 50/50 split. I'm not sure if I can do better, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
