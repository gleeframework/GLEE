Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, and I'm not. Take this before it gets worse. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough situation, but rejecting at this stage is too risky. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The inflation is severe.  Waiting any longer means a significantly smaller payout for me, even if I could secure a slightly better deal in a future round.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly aware of the inflation and is using it to her advantage. She's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this.

While 3000 is far from ideal, it's better than waiting another round and potentially getting an even worse offer."
