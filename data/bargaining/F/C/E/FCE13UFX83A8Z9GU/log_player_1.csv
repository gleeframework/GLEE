"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm hoping Bob will see the benefits of ending the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 20 is now worth $16.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
