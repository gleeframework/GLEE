"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer is very generous to Bob.  It's likely he'll accept it, but if not, I'm confident I can still get a good deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I prefer more money, the risk of getting even less in the next round makes this a good deal. I'm confident I can earn more in other ways."
