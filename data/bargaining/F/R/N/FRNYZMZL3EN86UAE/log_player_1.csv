Bob's offer is a bit more generous, but I'm not sure if I should accept it yet. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

Bob's offer is more generous, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'd like to try to get an even better deal.

However, considering the inflation, I'm starting to feel the pressure to make a decision. I'll try to think strategically.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up much more, but I'm willing to give you a bigger share to avoid going to the last rounds. 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking its toll! With the current rate, my gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, so I'm effectively getting $17.98 (60 * 0.5945 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9).

Bob's offer is generous, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'm getting close to the minimum effective value of $1. However, considering the low value of the money and the fact that we're getting close to the last rounds, I think it's time to make a decision.
