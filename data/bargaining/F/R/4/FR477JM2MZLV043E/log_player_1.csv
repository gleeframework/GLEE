I'm going to start by being very greedy and see how Bob reacts.  I'm taking almost everything for myself and leaving just $1 for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more,  Bob's offer is a fair 50/50 split. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and the inflation could hurt me.  It's better to take the sure thing."
