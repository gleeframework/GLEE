"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority, but still leaves Bob with something. This should encourage him to accept in the first round, as the value of the money will decrease in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a lot of money due to the inflation, Bob's offer gives me half the money, which is significantly better than the 1000 I would receive if I reject and enter round 3. I also don't know what offer Bob will make in round 3, and the inflation rate will be even worse by then."
