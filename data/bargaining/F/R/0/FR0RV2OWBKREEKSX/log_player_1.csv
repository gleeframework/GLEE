"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor.  Since this is the first round, I'm taking a large share, but I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and I'm not sure I can do much better, especially with the inflation risk.  Accepting is the best option."
