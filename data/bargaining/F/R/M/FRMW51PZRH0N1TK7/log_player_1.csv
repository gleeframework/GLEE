"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000, and I'll take $6000. Let's see if you can do better.""
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will try to negotiate a better deal for himself!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time. Will you accept? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $6000 is now worth less, but Bob's $4000 is worth even less!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving him such a large share. However, I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so my $6000 is now worth even less. I need to think strategically about how to make a good offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you $4500, and I'll take $5500. Let's see if you can do better.""
}
```

This is a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer, but still relatively fair. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this. Will you accept? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! My $6000 from the first round is now worth significantly less, and Bob's $4000 is also worth less, but not as much less as mine.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a larger share, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting an even worse deal."
