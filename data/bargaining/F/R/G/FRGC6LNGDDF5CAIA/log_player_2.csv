Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a compromise, but a 50/50 split just doesn't work in the face of this inflation. This offer is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it carefully. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offers are getting worse for her. While this offer isn't great, holding out for one more round might force her to make a much bigger concession due to the rapidly declining value of the money."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4700,

}

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Point:**  Alice is acutely feeling the inflation and her offers are reflecting her desperation. By taking a slightly firmer stance and presenting it as a final offer, we increase the chance she'll fold.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even though this offer isn't a 50/50 split, it's still better than what Alice proposed in Round 5.  Waiting longer means the value decreases, making even a ""win"" less appealing. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a gamble here. Alice might call our bluff, but her next offer could be significantly worse for us if she's desperate. This offer represents a calculated risk to secure a reasonable sum before it dwindles further."
