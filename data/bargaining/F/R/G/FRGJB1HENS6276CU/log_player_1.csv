"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for negotiations in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I'll have to consider the proposal carefully. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share to account for the inflation""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give myself a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 50/50 is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less for me, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 38/62 split, especially since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway between 40/60 and 50/50, let's see if we can find a middle ground""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50/50 split, but still gives me a slightly larger share to account for the ongoing inflation."
