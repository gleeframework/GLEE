Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 99/1 split in my favor.  I figure I'll take the lion's share, and Bob will likely accept as it's better than nothing.  I'll see how he reacts to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled about getting only 10$, it's better than nothing. I don't know how inflation will affect things in the future, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer.  It's time to secure at least some of the money."
