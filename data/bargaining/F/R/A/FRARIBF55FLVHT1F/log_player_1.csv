Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on.  While it's risky, I'm hoping Bob will see the benefit of getting something rather than nothing as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, the risk of getting nothing in later rounds is too high. This offer provides a significant amount, and the inflation will likely further erode the value of any future rounds. It's in my best interest to secure this deal."
