"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic ultimatum game. I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large share of the money early on.  I'm assuming Bob might be risk-averse and accept this offer, even though it's unfair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the most rational choice.  

* **Inflation:** The 20% reduction in my gains means I'm essentially losing money with each passing round. 
* **Risk:** Rejecting this offer means risking a worse offer from Bob in the next round, potentially leading to even lower gains for me. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Even with the 20% inflation, I'm still gaining a substantial amount compared to the potential of getting nothing if we reach the end of the game.

This offer is not ideal, but it's the best I can do given the circumstances."
