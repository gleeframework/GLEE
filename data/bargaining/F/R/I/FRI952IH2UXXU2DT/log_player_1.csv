"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, since I'm the first to make an offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate in the next round if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm accepting this offer. With the inflation, my share is worth less than it would have been in the first round.  It's better to take the 50% now than risk getting less in a future round."
