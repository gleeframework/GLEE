}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money, which is $70, and Bob gets 30% of the money, which is $30. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early!"

# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a deal! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
