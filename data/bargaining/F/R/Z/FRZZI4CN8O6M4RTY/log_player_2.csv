Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Reflecting the true cost of waiting 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the decreasing value of the money to her advantage, hoping I'll panic and accept a worse deal as time goes on.  While the impact of inflation is real, her offer is getting increasingly unfair.  I need to hold firm and propose offers that acknowledge the inflation but don't completely cave to her demands."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5700, ""alice_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""This offer considers the inflation while still allowing us both a reasonable share.  Let's be realistic and close this deal.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me more; let's balance this 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her argument of inflation hurting her more is a blatant manipulation tactic. My offers have been consistently acknowledging the inflation, but she's not budging much. This indicates she might be willing to risk it all for a slightly larger share. Holding firm is crucial at this point."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is more than fair considering the lost value, and it ensures we both walk away with something.  Don't let greed cloud your judgment.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chances for a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The risk of getting nothing is becoming too high. While Alice's offer is still far from ideal, it's better to secure a smaller gain than risk getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds. It's a tough decision, but time pressure forces my hand."
