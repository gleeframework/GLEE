Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still need a fair deal given the inflation.  Let's split it 60/40 this time. It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
