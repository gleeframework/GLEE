"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer for Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly. I'm aiming for a 90/10 split in my favor, but I'm willing to give him a little bit to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer. I'm willing to lose some of the money due to inflation, but not that much.  I'll reject this and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a good split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise a little more to avoid another rejection. I'm reducing my share to 80% and increasing Bob's to 20%, hoping this will be more enticing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still much less than I'd like, and with inflation hitting harder now, it's even worse than his previous offer.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount yet. I'll keep playing and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 75%, trying to find a balance between getting a fair deal and preventing further rejections. Inflation is really starting to bite, and I need to be more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call.  Inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and the longer we play, the worse it gets.  While I'd prefer more, this is a 50/50 split, which is fair considering Bob's stubbornness.  I'll accept it and move on."
