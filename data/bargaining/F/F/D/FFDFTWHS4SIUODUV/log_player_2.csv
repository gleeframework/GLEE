"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not satisfied with a 40% share. I believe we can do better!  Let's see what Alice has to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share since I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's get this done!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would still prefer a 60-40 split, I realize the money is losing value quickly. Accepting this offer will at least secure me a decent amount."
