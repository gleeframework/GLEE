"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share since I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks a 60-40 split is fairer, but I'm not convinced. The value of the money is decreasing with each round, so I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so we're now dealing with $9,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
