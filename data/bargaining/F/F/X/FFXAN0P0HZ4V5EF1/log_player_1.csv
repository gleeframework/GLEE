"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take 60 dollars and Bob can have 40 dollars. It's a reasonable offer, considering I'm the one making the first move. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept an even split this early in the game. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I think I can get a better deal if I wait. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less than before, but still more than half""}\n\n###\n\nI'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want to get a larger share. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer! Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my offer of 58 is actually worth around 52.2 in ""real"" dollars, so I think it's still a reasonable offer."

# Alice gain: 45

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, Bob's offer of 55 is actually worth around 40.05 in ""real"" dollars, and my offer of 45 is worth around 32.85 in ""real"" dollars. I think I can get a better deal if I wait. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\n###\n\nI'm willing to compromise and meet Bob in the middle of our previous offers.
