"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I propose a split close to 50/50.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'll reject this offer.  While it's close to 50/50, there's still room for me to get a slightly better deal.  I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I propose a slightly better deal for me, but still close to 50/50. See if you like it!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go back to a true 50/50 split. Inflation is hitting us both, and I think we can both agree this is the fairest way to proceed. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's not a perfect deal, but inflation is hurting us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point."
