"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can avoid the inflation that will come with more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 2000$ is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 8000$ is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth even less than before. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly higher share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the new values, my gain of 3000$ is now worth 93.74% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 7000$ is worth 56% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can still do better than this. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and share the money equally. It's the fairest way to end this.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value of the money."
