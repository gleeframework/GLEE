I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can get this over with quickly.  Let's see if he's greedy or reasonable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy!  He's trying to take almost everything. I'll reject this offer and make my own in the next round.  I'm sure he won't want to risk losing even more money!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly due to the inflation, but I'm still giving Bob a decent share. Hopefully, he'll realize that continuing to reject offers will only hurt him more in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unreasonable, even with the inflation.  He's taking advantage of the situation and trying to get away with taking most of the money. I'm going to keep rejecting these offers and see if he'll come to his senses before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm getting increasingly wary of Bob's stubbornness, so I'm lowering my offer again.  It's getting riskier with each passing round, but I'm not willing to let him take advantage of the situation. Hopefully, this offer will make him reconsider before things get worse for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being incredibly greedy!  I'm going to reject this offer and keep pushing for a fairer distribution. It's risky, but I'm not giving in to his demands. I'm not going to lose almost everything, and I'm sure he'll realize he's losing more with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm taking another risk here, but I think this might be my last chance to get a decent deal.  Bob's greed is getting worse, and I'm afraid we're both going to lose more if we keep going like this.  He needs to understand that I'm not going to give in to his unreasonable demands, and he needs to be more reasonable himself."
