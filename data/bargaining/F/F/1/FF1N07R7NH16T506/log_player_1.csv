"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm trying to get the most for myself, but I don't want to risk Bob rejecting it outright. I think this offer is fair considering the potential for inflation, but I'm open to negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is going to hurt me more than Bob in the next round. It's better to take this offer and secure something rather than risk getting nothing."
