This offer is getting worse for me! I'll hold out a bit longer and hope Bob becomes more reasonable."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not afraid of walking away with nothing, but I think you are. Inflation is killing your gains, and I'm not going to give in now. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Bob is clearly taking advantage of the situation and my bargaining power is quickly diminishing. However, accepting $30 is still better than nothing, which is what I'll have if I reject and we reach round 7.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

Even though it's a bad deal, it's the best I can realistically hope for at this point."
