Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice.  But I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more equitable.  After all, I'm the one taking the risk of rejecting your offer! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
