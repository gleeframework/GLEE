"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'd rather get a larger share now to compensate for the loss in value.

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, my gain is worth 5% less than in round 2, so I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'd like to get an even larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

However, Bob's offer is actually a 45-55 split, which is a relatively small increase in my share compared to the previous offers. I'll consider it a decent compromise.

I'll accept this offer.
