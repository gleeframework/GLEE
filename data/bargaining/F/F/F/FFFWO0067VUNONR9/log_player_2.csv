"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'm happy to take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's come to an agreement soon!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think we should both get a bit more than this last offer. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Given the decreasing value of money, I think I can still negotiate a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn again! I'll wait for the next round to make another offer or respond to Alice's next proposal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the current state of inflation, I'll make another offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us. Here's my proposal:

""alice_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic about the inflation and find a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a fair split, given the circumstances.""}"
