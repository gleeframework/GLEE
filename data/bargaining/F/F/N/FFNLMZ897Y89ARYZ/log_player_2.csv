"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the 60-40 split seems fair at first glance, the crucial factor here is the asymmetric inflation. Alice loses value much faster than I do. It's highly likely I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds as her position weakens."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but the value decreases rapidly for you. Let's be practical. 60-40 my way is a generous offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:**  Alice is losing value much faster than Bob. By round 2, her $6,000 is already worth considerably less.  This time pressure works in Bob's favor.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  While Bob's offer is a reversal, framing it as a ""generous"" and ""practical"" solution might make Alice consider it seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer doesn't completely lowball Alice. There's still room for her to negotiate a slightly better split in subsequent rounds, which might be more palatable than her initial offer after further depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise a bit, considering the inflation. 58-42 is as low as I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure, but she's still overvaluing her position. Her offer is only slightly better, and the longer we wait, the more desperate she'll become. I need to hold out for a significantly better split, capitalizing on the rapid devaluation of her share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. Time is literally money here, and yours is disappearing fast. 70-30 is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** The devaluation heavily favors Bob now. Alice's potential gains are shrinking rapidly, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By presenting this as his ""final offer,"" Bob creates a sense of urgency, hoping Alice will choose a decent deal now rather than risk getting even less later.
* **Leaving a Small Margin:** While a 70-30 split is heavily in Bob's favor, it still leaves Alice with something. This might be enough to prevent her from acting irrationally and gambling on future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up yet! 56-44 is still a better deal for me than your 'final offer'. Inflation hurts, but I'll take the risk. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now within an acceptable range. Here's why:

* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** While I still have the advantage, Alice is clearly willing to play hardball.  Her willingness to risk further losses means I need to be cautious about overplaying my hand.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more in later rounds, the difference is no longer as significant. Accepting now guarantees a decent amount, while further delays carry increasing risk.
* **Potential for Irrationality:** The longer the game goes on, the higher the chance Alice acts emotionally rather than logically.  Securing a reasonable deal now avoids the possibility of her making a desperate, last-minute gamble that leaves us both with nothing."
