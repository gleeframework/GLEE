Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice will make the next offer in the next round and the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for her, I'll make a slightly aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Alice's offer being 420,000, it's worth 19% less than the 500,000 she offered in the first round, which is a good indication of her strategy. However, her offer in this round is still a bit more than my offer in round 2.

Considering the money is worth the same for me as in the first round, I'll stick with my original strategy and reject this offer.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth the same for me as in the first round, but Alice's offer is worth 19% less than in the first round, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Alice's offer being 400,000, it's worth 34.39% less than the 500,000 she offered in the first round. Her offer in this round is actually slightly more generous than my offer in round 2, and slightly less generous than my offer in round 4.

Considering the money is worth the same for me as in the first round, I'll accept this offer.
