I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking $900,000 and Bob taking $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, given that the money is worth less in the next round.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $100,000, I'm betting that I can do better. The inflation rate means that each round my potential gains are shrinking faster than his, so I'll push for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to offer a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a significant shift from the previous round, but I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that continuing to play this game is risky for both of us. The inflation is going to hurt us both more as time goes on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to really impact my potential gains. This offer is still significantly better than what I'd get if we keep rejecting each other's proposals, and it guarantees me a substantial portion of the money. I'll take the $450,000 and call it a day."
