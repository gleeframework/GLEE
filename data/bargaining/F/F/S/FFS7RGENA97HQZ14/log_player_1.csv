"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose to keep 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. This is a generous offer, but it's also important to secure a significant portion of the money early on before inflation takes effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While it seems tempting to take 10 dollars, the inflation risk is too high. I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to 75 dollars for myself and 25 dollars for Bob.  I'm still aiming for a significant share, but acknowledging the potential for further inflation.  This offer still shows a willingness to compromise while securing a majority of the funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Although 20 dollars is something, I believe I can do better. Inflation is impacting Bob more than me, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the upcoming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again to 60 dollars for me and 40 dollars for Bob. While I'm still aiming for a majority of the money,  I'm willing to concede a bit more to incentivize Bob to accept, given the increasing inflation affecting him more. This offer reflects a balance between securing a good share and reaching a compromise before the rounds run out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 30 dollars is more than what Bob offered in the previous round, it's still far from what I believe I can secure. Inflation is significantly impacting Bob, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the upcoming rounds. I will continue to try and secure a larger share before the remaining time runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. With inflation affecting Bob more than me, I believe this is a fair and reasonable solution. This ensures that we both receive a significant portion of the money while minimizing the impact of inflation. It's also a good strategy to prevent any further rounds of rejections, which could ultimately result in a worse outcome for both of us."
