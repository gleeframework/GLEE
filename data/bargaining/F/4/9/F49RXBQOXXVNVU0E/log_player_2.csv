Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work out a more balanced deal later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer seems generous in the first round, it's important to remember the inflation rates.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counterproposal in the next round and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
