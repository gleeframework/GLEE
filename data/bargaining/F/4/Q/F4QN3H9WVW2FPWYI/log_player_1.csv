"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100$ and Bob gets 20%. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 40% of the current value of the money, which is 100 * (1 - 0.05)^2 = 95$. So, I'll get 40% of 95$, which is 38.

If I reject this offer, I'll have to make a new proposal in the next round, and the money will be worth 5% less again.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer.
