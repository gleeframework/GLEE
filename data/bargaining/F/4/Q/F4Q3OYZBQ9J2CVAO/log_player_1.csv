**Explanation:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The inflation rate is significant, and my gains are reduced by 27.1% compared to the initial round. Bob's gains are reduced by 48.8%.
* **Strategic Analysis:** Although I would prefer more, getting $20 is better than nothing. In the next round, Bob will get to propose, and the inflation will further decrease my share, likely making it even lower than $20.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of getting a worse deal in the future rounds due to inflation."
