"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we can still play more rounds if we want to try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less, but I still want to leave room for future negotiations."
