"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can do better later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I think we can both do better than this, but I'm willing to be reasonable 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, this offer is actually more favorable to me than the previous one, since my gain is still worth the same as before.

I'll accept this offer.
