"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6000, you get $4000.  It's in our best interest to settle this quickly before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fairer if we split the money equally.  Let's try 50/50.  We have to be careful about inflation, though!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair split, but the inflation hits you harder. Let's compromise: I get $5500, you get $4500. This is better for you in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more equal split, this offer is better for me considering the inflation. Let's settle this now."
