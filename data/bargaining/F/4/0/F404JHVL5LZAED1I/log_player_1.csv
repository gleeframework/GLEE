"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point, recognizing the value of my time in making the first proposal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 60/40 split in my favor, huh? I'm not sure I like that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll stick to my original idea of a 50/50 split. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in round 2. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still sticking to a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm still aiming for a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to give Bob a slight edge to see if we can reach an agreement. Your turn, Bob!"
