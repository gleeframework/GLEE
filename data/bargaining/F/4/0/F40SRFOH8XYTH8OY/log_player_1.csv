"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's see if we can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll consider the new values:

* Alice gain: 5000 (initially 8000, now 80% of 8000 * 0.8 = 6400)
* Bob gain: 5000 (initially 2000, now 20% of 8000 * 0.8 = 1600)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll accept it for now. Maybe we can do better in future rounds.
