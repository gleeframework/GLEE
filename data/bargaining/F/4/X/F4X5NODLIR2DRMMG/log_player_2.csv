"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's far too generous. It's likely she's trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm the first to respond. I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's split it more fairly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I'm still willing to share, but we need to move quickly to avoid losing more value. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still offering a very lopsided deal.  While it's better than her first offer,  I'm still confident I can do better. I need to be patient and see if I can leverage the inflation to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The money is losing value fast. We need to find a compromise quickly.  I propose a 50/50 split. What do you say?""}
