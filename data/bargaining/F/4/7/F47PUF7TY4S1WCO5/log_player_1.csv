"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I take 900,000 and Bob takes 100,000. This is a fair starting offer, considering I'll be taking a significant hit on the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time, accounting for the inflation on both sides. I'm willing to take 800,000 while Bob gets 200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm going to stick to a similar pattern, but lower my take a bit more to try and find a compromise. 700,000 for me, and 300,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

I'm reducing my share again, hoping to find a compromise before we both lose out. 600,000 for me, and 400,000 for Bob."
