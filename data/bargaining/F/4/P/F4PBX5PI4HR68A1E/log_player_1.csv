Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the initial amount. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly hurt by the inflation, but he's still holding out for more than half.  My bargaining position is only getting stronger. It's risky, but I think I can get him to agree to a better deal for me in the next round or two."
