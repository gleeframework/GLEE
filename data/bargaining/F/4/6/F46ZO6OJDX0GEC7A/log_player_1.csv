"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a very aggressive first offer, as Alice is trying to secure nearly all the money. However, she is aware of the inflation risk and wants to finalize the deal quickly. Bob can either accept this offer, ending the game with a small gain, or reject it, pushing the game forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
