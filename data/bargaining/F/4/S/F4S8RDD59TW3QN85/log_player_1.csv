Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic Alice.  I'm offering you a deal where you still get a good chunk, but I get more to reflect that this money loses value for both of us over time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
