"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of 50$ is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, since it's 20% less due to inflation.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of 50$ is worth the same amount to him, but I'll assume it is for now.

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob halfway, since I was hoping for a better deal earlier. However, this offer is a significant improvement from my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation.
