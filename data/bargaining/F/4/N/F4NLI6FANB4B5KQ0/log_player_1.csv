Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly uneven split, hoping to secure a majority of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though Bob is offering me 1000, it's a significant reduction from my initial 9000.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my demands a bit, but still aiming for a majority of the money.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair. I'm not going to accept such a small share, especially since inflation is working against Bob. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time.  With inflation hitting Bob harder, it's becoming clear that an even division is probably the most likely outcome."
