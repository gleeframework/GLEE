"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice is proposing to take $60 and leave $40 for Bob. She attaches a message suggesting that this division is somewhat fair but slightly biased in her favor. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer by framing it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a bit more, but let's make this fair. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because, despite his message framing it as fair, the division of $45 for me and $55 for him seems less favorable to me than my initial proposal. Given that the money's value remains the same for me but decreases for Bob with each round, I'm inclined to negotiate further, hoping to find a more advantageous split. Additionally, with 10 rounds remaining, there's ample opportunity to reach a more satisfactory agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a better deal for you than it looks""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take $58 and leave $42 for Bob. My message points out the impact of inflation on Bob's gains, suggesting that accepting this offer now would be more beneficial for him than holding out for a potentially better deal in future rounds, which may be worth less due to inflation. This strategy aims to persuade Bob by highlighting the diminishing value of future offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is working against us.  Let's split it evenly before it gets worse. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of an even split because, given the effects of inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money's value remains constant for me but decreases for Bob, I'm in a stronger negotiating position. Bob's eagerness to split the money evenly before inflation worsens suggests he's aware of his disadvantage, which I can leverage to push for a more favorable split in the next rounds. With 8 rounds left, there's still plenty of time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Inflation is indeed a factor, but I'm willing to make a deal if you are""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take $62 and leave $38 for Bob. My message acknowledges Bob's concern about inflation but also indicates my willingness to find an agreement. By slightly increasing my share from the previous offer, I'm testing Bob's patience and willingness to accept a less favorable deal due to the pressure of inflation. This strategy aims to find the right balance between asserting my advantage and keeping the negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This offer gives me a chance to get a reasonable amount while still giving you a slight advantage. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because, despite his message emphasizing the urgency of the situation and the supposed advantage I'd receive, the division of $52 for me and $48 for him still doesn't align with my expectations. Given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains, I believe I can secure a more favorable split. With 6 rounds remaining, I see an opportunity to further negotiate and increase my share, leveraging the fact that Bob's portion of the money decreases in value with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Time is indeed a factor, for you more than me. Let's settle this.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take $65 and leave $35 for Bob. My message acknowledges the time pressure but highlights that it affects Bob more significantly due to the inflation impacting his potential gains. By increasing my share, I'm applying pressure on Bob to accept, emphasizing that the longer he waits, the less valuable his portion becomes. This strategy aims to bring the negotiations to a close with a favorable outcome for me."
