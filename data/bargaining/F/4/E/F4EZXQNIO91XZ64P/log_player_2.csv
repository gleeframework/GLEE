# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed a factor, but I'm willing to make a deal if you are 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While her offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means risking getting a smaller amount later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer gives me a chance to get a reasonable amount while still giving you a slight advantage. Let's close this deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is indeed a factor, for you more than me. Let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me.  While this is a terrible offer, if I reject it, there's a very good chance I'll end up with even less in the following rounds.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but it's better than getting nothing."
