"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial offer.

I'll reject this proposal and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're still lowballing me! I want a better deal.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking a toll on me! My offer is now worth 10% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'm still looking for a better deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal than the 42-58 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a better split! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since I'm getting closer to the middle ground, I'll consider accepting this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 45-55 it is. Better than the last two offers!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and I hope we can wrap up the game here!"
