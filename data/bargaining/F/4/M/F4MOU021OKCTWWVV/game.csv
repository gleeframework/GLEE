600000.0,400000.0,I propose dividing the money with a 60:40 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to benefit from the division while considering the decreasing value of money over rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I propose a 55:45 split in my favor. This is a fairer split considering the diminishing value of money for you in each round.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
