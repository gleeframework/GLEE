"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'll start by offering a relatively fair split, hoping to end the game quickly. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that favors me slightly, knowing the money will be worth less to him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game! I'll reject this offer. While it seems tempting to take $10, I know Bob will be proposing a similar, but slightly less advantageous offer in the next round, and I will still be able to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try to get a better deal this time. I'm offering a more favorable split, knowing that the money will be worth less to Bob in the next round. It's a bit risky, but I believe it will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to take $20, it's clear that Bob is trying to get a better deal every round.  He's been rejecting my offers, and the inflation is hitting him harder than it is hitting me. I believe I can still get a better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to keep raising my offer slightly, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure. The game is getting close to the end, and I want to make sure I get something out of it. I think this offer is a good compromise that will be appealing to Bob given his diminishing gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt Bob.  He's still trying to get a better deal, but his offers are becoming less and less appealing. I'm confident I can get more than $30, especially with only a few rounds left. I'm going to keep rejecting his offers and pushing for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm getting closer to the end of the game, and I'm realizing that I need to be more aggressive in my offers. While I'm still trying to be fair, I need to secure a good deal for myself. With the inflation hitting Bob harder, I think this offer will finally be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with only four rounds left. I'm sticking to my strategy and rejecting this offer. The inflation is working in my favor, and I believe I can still get a majority of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

Time is running out, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm offering a slightly lower amount to Bob, but I'm hoping that with only three rounds left, he'll finally be willing to accept. I'm also aware of the inflation hitting him harder, and I'm betting that this offer will be more appealing than waiting for a few more rounds."
