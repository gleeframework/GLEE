Round 5

Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice acknowledges the inflation, she's still heavily favoring herself.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and my bargaining position weakens significantly with each rejection. However, accepting a deal where I get less than 45% of the original amount is unlikely to happen. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away, hoping she'll offer something closer to 45/55 in the next round."

I understand your position, but the inflation is severely impacting me. If this offer is rejected, I'm likely to keep pushing for a larger share, as the value diminishes with each round.""}"
