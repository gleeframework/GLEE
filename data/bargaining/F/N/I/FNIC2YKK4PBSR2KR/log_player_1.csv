"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, and I'll take 80 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculation.

My gain of 40 dollars in this round is equivalent to 50 dollars in the first round. Since I offered 80 dollars in the first round, I'm now getting a better deal.

I accept Bob's offer.
