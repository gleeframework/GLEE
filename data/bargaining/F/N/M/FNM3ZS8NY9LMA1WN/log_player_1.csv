"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a proposal that is fair, but slightly favors me. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal where he gets a smaller share, or if he'll push for more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I understand that inflation has reduced the value of the money for me, Bob's offer is very unbalanced. It's still worth trying to negotiate a more equitable split, especially since I'll be the one proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more balanced offer than Bob's previous proposal, and it still takes into account the 5% inflation that has affected my earnings. I believe this is a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse for me. The inflation has taken a significant toll on my potential earnings. Although I'm running out of rounds, I'm still going to reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable offer considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential earnings.  I hope Bob will see the value in a compromise and accept this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Despite the significant inflation impact on my potential earnings, I'm forced to accept Bob's offer.  This is the last round, and a rejection will lead to both of us getting nothing.  While this is a very unfavorable outcome, it's better than getting nothing at all."
