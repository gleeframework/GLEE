"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to keep the game going.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. It's still a good offer, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'd receive are:

* My gain: $6,000 / 0.9 (due to 10% inflation) = $6,667
* Bob's gain: $4,000 / 0.8 (due to 20% inflation) = $5,000

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's better than the previous one. I'll accept it.
