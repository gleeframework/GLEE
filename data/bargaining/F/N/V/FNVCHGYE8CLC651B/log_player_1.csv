"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the remaining value of the money, considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm taking a slightly larger share this time, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! Considering the significant drop in value, I'll think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I think it's better to accept this offer and get a smaller share of the remaining value, rather than risking it getting even smaller in the next round."
