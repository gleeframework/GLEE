Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation taking its toll, my offer needs to be more aggressive. Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm offering to take a larger share this time, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential gains! With my share being worth significantly less, I'll have to be more careful. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept this offer to get something, rather than risking it all.
