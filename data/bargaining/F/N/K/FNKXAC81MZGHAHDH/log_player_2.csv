Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me more, so I need a bit more! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are getting worse for me in real terms due to the faster inflation she experiences.  I need to hold firm to secure a better deal in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for both of us, especially Alice.  Offering a 50/50 split seems fair at this point, and it might be my last chance to secure a decent amount before the inflation eats away at the value too much."
