Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
