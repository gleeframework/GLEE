"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste time. This offer is fair and prevents further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still tilted in her favor.  The inflation is hurting her much more than me, so I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 620000,
""alice_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Let's end this now before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is finally willing to agree to a 50/50 split.  While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is quickly eroding the value of the money. Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
