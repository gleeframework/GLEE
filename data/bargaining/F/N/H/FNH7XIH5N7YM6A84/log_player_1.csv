"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping we can negotiate a better deal as we go along.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal now. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than before, so the $60 I would gain is actually worth 80% of the original $60, which is $48.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept it for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
