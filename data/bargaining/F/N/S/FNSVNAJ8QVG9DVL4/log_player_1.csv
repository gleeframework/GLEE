Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm willing to give you the majority, but let's be a little more even.  This is just a starting point, we can always negotiate more in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
