Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous and offering Bob $100,000, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of losing more money in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject this offer. Although I would get something, it's much less than I originally offered Bob, and he still gets a huge chunk. I'm willing to gamble on getting a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share now, as inflation is affecting his money more than mine. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is severely impacting Bob's gains. This offer is still significantly better than what I would get in the next round, considering the accelerating inflation. I'll take it and end this game."
