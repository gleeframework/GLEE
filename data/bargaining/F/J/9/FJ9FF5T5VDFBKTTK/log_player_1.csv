"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a 4:1 ratio."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'm now considering a gain of $7,000. Since Bob's offer is a 7:3 ratio, I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200
