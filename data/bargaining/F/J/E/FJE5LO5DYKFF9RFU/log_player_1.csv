"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is too aggressive. I propose a 80/20 split in my favor to account for the risk of inflation, but still give you a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
