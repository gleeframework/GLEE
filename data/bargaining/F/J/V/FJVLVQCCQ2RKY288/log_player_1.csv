"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You get the smaller share, I get the larger one.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, no haggling 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of 5000 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
