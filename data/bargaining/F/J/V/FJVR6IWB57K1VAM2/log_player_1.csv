"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting 60$ and Bob getting 40$. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and then negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd like to try to get a slightly better deal. A 50-50 split is still a bit too even for me, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a 5% toll, my gain is now worth less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly higher share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting 55$ and Bob getting 45$. The message is a friendly reminder that I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains now!

I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, although it's still not my ideal share, I think the 45-55 split is a reasonable compromise. I'd rather take this deal than risk going to another round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation."
