Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as eager to accept a lower share.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

I'm offering a 50/50 split, but I'm hoping it's more appealing to Bob this time."
