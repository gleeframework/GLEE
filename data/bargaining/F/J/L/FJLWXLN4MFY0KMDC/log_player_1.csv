"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, inflation is working against me. Accepting this 50/50 split now means I'm effectively getting less than half the original value. I need to push for a better deal in the next round while it's my turn to propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's compromise. This offer is still pretty even, but accounts for the fact that time is costing me.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation is hitting you harder. This offer is a compromise that takes that into account while still being fair. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is tricky. Bob is acknowledging the inflation, but his offer is still tilting the scales in his favor.  While the gap seems small, I need to consider that every round makes a bigger difference due to the increasing impact of inflation. I'll hold out for a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair deal. Let's just split it evenly and not risk losing everything to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is becoming a serious factor now. While I was holding out for a slightly better deal, the risk of letting more rounds pass is getting too high. Accepting a 50/50 split now is the safest option to guarantee a decent payout. Bob is unlikely to agree to anything better anyway."
