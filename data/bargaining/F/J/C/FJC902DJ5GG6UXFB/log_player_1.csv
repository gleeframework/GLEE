"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a significant difference in favor of Bob. I'll have to think carefully before accepting or rejecting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was heavily biased towards him, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting even more lopsided! I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with such a small share. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, since Bob's previous offers have been quite one-sided. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me a significant majority of the funds, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting ridiculous! Leaving me with just $100,000 is unacceptable. I'm not going to accept an offer that's so heavily biased towards him.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make an offer that's more balanced, but still takes into account that Bob has been pushing for a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a slight majority, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an insult! Leaving me with just $50,000 is outrageous. I'm not going to accept an offer that's so heavily biased towards Bob.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'm getting desperate, but I'll try to make one more offer that's reasonable. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This offer gives me a large majority, but still leaves Bob with a small but not insignificant amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this one, but I'm not counting on it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an absurdly one-sided offer! Leaving me with just $10,000 is unacceptable. I'm not going to accept an offer that's so heavily biased towards Bob.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'm running out of options, but I'll try to make one final offer that's reasonable. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This offer gives me a large majority, but still leaves Bob with a tiny amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this one, but I'm not optimistic.

This is my last chance to make a proposal. If he rejects this one, we'll be going into the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's it, I've had enough! Leaving me with just $1,000 is completely unacceptable. I'm not going to accept an offer that's so heavily biased towards Bob.

But, since we've reached the final round and I've rejected his offer, I suppose I have no choice but to accept the default outcome.
