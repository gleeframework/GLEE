"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives you a fair share and avoids the risk of losing everything later. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's better to see if she's willing to budge.  The risk of getting nothing is high, and I can potentially get a better deal by rejecting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be practical.  I'll take the majority, but you still get something.  We can avoid the risk of getting nothing if we agree now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be generous, but your last offer was insulting.  Time is running out - let's be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a good deal for me. While I might be able to get a bit more by continuing, the risk of getting nothing is growing. Accepting this ensures I get something while Alice still gets a majority, making it a good compromise."
