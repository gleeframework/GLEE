"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I need to be cautious. 

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to get a better ratio. I'll offer a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, but I want it to be 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 27.1%, Bob's gain is significantly reduced. A 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the current market conditions.

I'll accept this offer.
