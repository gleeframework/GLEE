Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10.  This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split.  It seems like a fair and equitable solution, and it avoids further rounds of potential losses due to inflation."
