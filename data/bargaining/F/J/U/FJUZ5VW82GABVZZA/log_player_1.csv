"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good start, but don't get too comfortable!""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up just yet, and I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining money!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less now, so I need to be strategic. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the remaining $900,000 (after inflation) and Bob 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the upper hand yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! I need to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd get:

$1,000,000 x 0.727 (1 - 0.273 inflation) = $727,000

So, Bob's offer would give me $450,000, which is about 61.8% of the value of the original $1,000,000. That's not bad, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can do.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to do better next time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is losing value fast! I need to make a good offer. Here's my next one:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob! Don't wait too long!""
}
```

This offer gives me 49% of the remaining $727,000 (after inflation) and Bob 51%. I'm trying to be fair, but I'm also trying to get as much as I can!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice! I'm not backing down! 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I need to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 40.95% less for me, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd get:

$1,000,000 x 0.592 (1 - 0.408 inflation) = $592,000

So, Bob's offer would give me $510,000, which is about 86.4% of the value of the original $592,000. That's a good offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can do.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to do better next time, but I'm running out of options!"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet, Bob! Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

This offer gives me 54% of the remaining $592,000 (after inflation) and Bob 46%. I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm not getting any younger!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not willing to meet me, fine. I'll meet you in the middle then! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is disappearing fast! I need to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 52.17% less for me, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd get:

$1,000,000 x 0.475 (1 - 0.522 inflation) = $475,000

So, Bob's offer would give me $480,000, which is about 101.1% of the value of the original $475,000. That's a good offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can do.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the deal, but I'm not thrilled about it!"
