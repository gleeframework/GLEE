Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $270,000
Bob gain: $665,000

I don't think I'm being too generous, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer.
