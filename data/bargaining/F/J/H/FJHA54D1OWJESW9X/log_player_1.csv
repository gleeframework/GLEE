"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which seems like a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual value of the offer.

If Bob's offer is 50% for me, that means I'll get $50, but its value is 90% of the original $50 (due to inflation), which is $45. The value of Bob's share is still $50, which is 50% of the original $100, or $50.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair split and I'll get a higher amount in real value than my initial offer.
