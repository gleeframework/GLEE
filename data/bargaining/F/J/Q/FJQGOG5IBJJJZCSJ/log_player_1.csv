"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'm effectively getting 450,000 / 0.9 = 500,000, which is the same as my original proposal. Bob, on the other hand, is getting 550,000, which is 10% more than his original proposal.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 10% inflation that affects my gain:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more skewed split this time, with me getting 40% and Bob getting 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gains considering the inflation:

My gain: 350,000 / 0.721 (1 - 0.279) = 484,058
Bob's gain: 650,000 / 0.8586 (1 - 0.1414) = 755,111

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'm getting less than my previous offer, but the inflation effect is significant. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the increasing inflation, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, hoping to get a better deal before the next round of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 275000 
# Bob gain: 725000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gains considering the inflation:

My gain: 275,000 / 0.5925 (1 - 0.4075) = 464,286
Bob's gain: 725,000 / 0.7778 (1 - 0.2222) = 933,333

This offer is not good for me. I'm getting less than my previous offer, and the inflation effect is significant. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is getting worse! I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000
}
```

I'm proposing a 20-80 split, hoping to get a better deal before the next round of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. Let's calculate the effective gains considering the inflation:

My gain: 150,000 / 0.4783 (1 - 0.5217) = 313,655
Bob's gain: 850,000 / 0.6978 (1 - 0.3022) = 1,219,111

This offer is not good for me. I'm getting less than my previous offer, and the inflation effect is huge. I'll reject this offer.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is getting out of control! I'll make a very aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100000,
  ""bob_gain"": 900000
}
```

I'm proposing a 10-90 split, hoping to get a better deal before the next round of inflation."
