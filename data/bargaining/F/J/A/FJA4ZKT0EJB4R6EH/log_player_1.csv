"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the original $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I think it's the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd be getting $400,000 in ""real"" value (500,000 x 0.8). That's not bad, but I was hoping to get more.

However, Bob's offer is indeed a fair one, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially getting less. So, I'll accept his offer.
