"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, knowing that the inflation will likely make Bob more amenable to accepting a smaller share as rounds progress. Let's see how it plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant improvement from the previous round, I still believe I can secure a better share, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll wait to see what he proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to try to get a slightly better deal than the previous round. I'm increasing my share by 10, but I'm still offering a small amount to Bob, hoping the inflation will make him accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. While it's not the best deal I've seen, the inflation is starting to bite hard for Bob, and his offer is getting more attractive. I'm happy to take 20% and move on."
