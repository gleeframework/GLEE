9000.0,1000.0,I think it's fair to start with a 90/10 split. I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point. It allows us both to get a good share of the money, and leaves room for negotiation in later rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but a 70/30 split is the best I can offer at this point. We both lose money with each passing round, so let's find a solution before the value drops too much further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split the money evenly.  We've both had our chances to propose, and the value keeps dropping.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to go at this point.",Bob,4,
