"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is 30% of the original $100. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game here."
