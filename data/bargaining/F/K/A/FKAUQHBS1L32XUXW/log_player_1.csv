"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 47.5 
# Bob gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.
