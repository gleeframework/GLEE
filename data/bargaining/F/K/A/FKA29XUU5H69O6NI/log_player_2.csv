"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  We can work from there! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! I'll try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That's not how fair deals work! I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Take it or leave it.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 70%, you take 30%.  We can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

That's still not good enough! While I appreciate her willingness to negotiate, I'm confident I can secure a better deal.  The pressure from inflation is on me more than her."
