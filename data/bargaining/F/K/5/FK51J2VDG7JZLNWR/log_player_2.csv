Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""That's a tough start, Alice.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Remember, the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing for both of us.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money 60/40 in your favor.  This is a fair deal given the decreasing value of the money, and it helps us avoid getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
