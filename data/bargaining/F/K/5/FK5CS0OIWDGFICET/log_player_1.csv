"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'm not sure I want to accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money is already losing value due to inflation. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal than my initial offer, while still keeping a decent amount for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is still a 54/46 split, which is not ideal for me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a split that's still heavily skewed towards Bob's favor, especially considering the money is losing value so quickly due to inflation. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much more""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and keeping a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much more 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is now a 48/52 split, which is actually closer to my initial offer in round 3. Considering the money is losing value so quickly, I think this is a reasonable compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and end the game. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's a fair split considering the circumstances."
