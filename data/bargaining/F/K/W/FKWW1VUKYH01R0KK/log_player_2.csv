Alice is playing a dangerous game, but I need to hold my ground a bit longer. The value is decreasing rapidly for me, but I still have a few rounds before it gets truly terrible."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting desperate, but I'm not backing down. This is my most generous offer yet 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I need to accept. 

Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The inflation is killing me. Waiting any longer will significantly decrease my potential gain, even if Alice offers slightly more.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** She's been consistently rejecting my offers and only increasing her share by tiny amounts. She seems content to drag this out, which works to her advantage. 

Taking $44 now is better than risking getting a much smaller amount, or even nothing, in the later rounds."
