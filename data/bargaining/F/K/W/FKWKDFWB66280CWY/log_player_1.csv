"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a slightly more favorable split this round, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a win-win! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll need a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially considering the value of money is decreasing for both of us. I'm hoping for a more even split in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, the money is now worth even less. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if we can find a fair split now.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which seems more balanced to me. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
