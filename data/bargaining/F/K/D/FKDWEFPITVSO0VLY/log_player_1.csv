"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20 to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 80-20, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more fair split. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my $40 gain in this round is worth 20% less than the $80 I would have gotten in the first round. But still, it's a decent offer.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for the sake of getting something, rather than risking a worse deal in the next round.
