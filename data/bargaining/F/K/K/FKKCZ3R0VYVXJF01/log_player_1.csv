Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal. I'm taking a bigger share, but I'm giving Bob something to encourage him to accept. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer, and he's taking advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my offer to 60% for myself, hoping to entice Bob into accepting.  While I'm still taking a bigger share, I'm acknowledging that he's getting a better deal than his previous offer, and I'm giving him a chance to avoid the continued depreciation of his share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is not as good as my previous offer, but it is a 50/50 split which is fair. Given that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each round, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round, so I'll take the 50% now."
