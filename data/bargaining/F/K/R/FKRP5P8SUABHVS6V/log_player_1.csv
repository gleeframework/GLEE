"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, Alice. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when making my decision.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 50/50 split just yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""You didn't take the 50/50 deal, so I'll try to get a better deal now.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 75-25 split in my favor, with me getting $7,500 and Bob getting $2,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. Let's see if you'll take it this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about Bob's new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll need to weigh the value of the money I'd receive against the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 40-60 split in my favor, with me getting $4,000 and Bob getting $6,000. It's a decent deal, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come."
