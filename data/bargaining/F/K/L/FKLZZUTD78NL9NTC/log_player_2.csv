Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me more, be fair 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the inflation argument to her advantage, but her offer is still not favorable to us. While she loses value quicker, accepting an offer where I receive less than $5000 is not strategically sound at this point in the game.  I need to apply more pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the circumstances.  Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  By Round 6, the inflation is starting to become a significant factor for both sides. A 50/50 split is the fairest offer, and by framing it as my ""final offer"", I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. She'll need to seriously consider if she's willing to risk getting a worse deal as the rounds progress and the money continues to lose value."
