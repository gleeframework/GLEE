"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more fair split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than the initial offer, since my gain is worth the same but Bob's gain is worth 5% less. However, I'm not convinced that 55/45 is the most fair split, considering the initial proposal was 60/40. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. 55/45 is a good compromise, but I think I can do better. How about 55.5/44.5?""

Your turn!"
