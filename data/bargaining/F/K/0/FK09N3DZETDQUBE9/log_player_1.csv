"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I want to keep negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 20% inflation, my offer is now worth less than before. I'll aim for a higher share to account for the decreased value of my potential gain. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 42% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob gets 58%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll calculate the effective value of the money I'd gain, taking into account the 48.8% decrease in value due to inflation. However, I don't know the exact inflation rate affecting Bob's gain.

Given that the offer is similar to the one I rejected in round 2, and considering the further decrease in the value of my potential gain, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll keep negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is really biting now!

Considering the 48.8% decrease in value of my potential gain, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate. However, I also need to consider that Bob might be getting a better deal due to the unknown inflation rate affecting his gain.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 48% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob gets 52%."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really accelerating!

Considering the 67.23% decrease in value of my potential gain, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth significantly less, I'll need to consider whether the offer is fair.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is similar to the previous one, and I'm not sure if I should accept it given the decreased value of my potential gain. After some thought, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll keep negotiating to try to get a better deal."
