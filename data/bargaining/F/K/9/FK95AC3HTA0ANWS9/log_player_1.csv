"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This is a more balanced split, and we can end the game quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, I'd be gaining 36 (40 * 0.9) and Bob would be gaining 54 (60 * 0.9). It's still a decent offer, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but don't think you're getting away that easily!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to negotiate a good deal for myself."
