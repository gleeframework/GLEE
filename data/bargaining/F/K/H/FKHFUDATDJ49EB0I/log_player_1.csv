Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to split the money a bit more evenly.  I'll take 55% and you can have 45%. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each round, I can try to negotiate for a larger share. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision."

Round 3

I'm hoping that the decreasing value of the money for Bob will pressure him into accepting my offer. Let's see what he decides.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because it's the same as my initial proposal, and I think it's a fair split. Since the money is worth the same for me in each round, I'm not losing anything by accepting this offer. Additionally, Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, so I'm confident that this is the best deal I can get. I'm happy to end the game here and take the $600,000.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the final outcome of the game."
