"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amount I'll gain in real value.

My gain in the first round was $60, and it's worth 10% less now, so I'll gain $60 * 0.9 = $54 in real value.

Bob's offer is $45, which is less than my gain in real value. I'll reject the offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain will be worth 10% less than $54, so I'll gain $54 * 0.9 = $48.6 in real value.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}"
