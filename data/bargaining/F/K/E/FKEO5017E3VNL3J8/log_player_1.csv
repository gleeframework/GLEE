"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and it gives us a chance to negotiate and adjust the split as we go along."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still being cautious. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'm not getting as much value out of the deal as I was in the first round. However, I still need to make a decision.

I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit stingy, I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit more aggressive. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the 50/50 split we started with. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my share! With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm getting a much smaller slice of the pie. However, I still need to make a decision.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not thrilled about it. I was hoping for a better split, considering the reduced value of my share.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm not giving up yet! With the money worth less and less, I need to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk and give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offers. I'm willing to take a risk and give Bob a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the reduced value of the money.

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to avoid further inflation, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Ugh, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! With the money worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'm getting a very small slice of the pie.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not thrilled about it. I was hoping for a better split, considering the reduced value of my share.

However, I'm also aware that if I reject this offer, I might not get a better deal in the next round, and the value of the money will continue to decrease.

I'll decide to...
