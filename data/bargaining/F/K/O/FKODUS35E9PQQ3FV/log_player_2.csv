"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide it fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer might seem tempting, it's best to consider the future rounds. By rejecting, Bob gets the chance to propose a deal that favors him more, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40.  It's a good deal for both of us, considering the money will lose value in the next rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, it's better for both 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still not as favorable as Bob's previous offer.  Bob should continue to hold out, hoping Alice will eventually concede to his 60/40 proposal as the inflation continues to impact her more than him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm sticking with my original offer.  With each round, we both lose money.  Let's be practical and secure this deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob, compromise! We're both losing here 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer, but Bob is still losing more value due to inflation. He should continue to push for his 60/40 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Time is running out.  My offer is final.  If you want to get anything at all, accept this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: 50/50, last chance for a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only a few rounds left, and the value of the money continuing to decrease rapidly for both of them, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer. While it's not the ideal outcome of 60/40, the 50/50 split ensures that Bob will receive some value from the money. The risk of rejecting and getting nothing is too high at this point."
