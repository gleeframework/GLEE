"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the money will lose value in the next rounds. Let's split it 55/45. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value at a faster rate, I need to think carefully about my next move. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 45 is enough for me. I'll need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and hoping that Bob will make a more generous proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is kicking in, and the money is worth even less now. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and make it a 50/50 split. No more negotiating, just a fair split.""
}
```

I'm making a more aggressive offer, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses even more value."
