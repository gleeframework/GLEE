Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a final offer: a straight 50/50 split.  It's the fairest deal and avoids further losses due to inflation.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is very unlikely to accept anything less than 50% at this point.  The longer this goes on, the more his share is worth to him due to the decreasing effect of inflation. It's better to secure a guaranteed win now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
