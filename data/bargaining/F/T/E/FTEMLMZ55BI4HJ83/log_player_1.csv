I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, given the inflation factor will work in Bob's favor over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 60/40.  While the inflation benefits Bob, I believe this split is still fair and allows for a potential agreement."
