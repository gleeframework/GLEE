"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

This is a fairly aggressive offer, but since we have 12 rounds and Bob's share loses value faster than mine, I want to secure a large portion early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing at all. It's also possible that Bob might offer me even less in future rounds."
