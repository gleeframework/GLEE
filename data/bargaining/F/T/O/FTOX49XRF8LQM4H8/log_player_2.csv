**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently aiming for a larger share, and while her offer is slowly moving towards a more even split,  we're running out of time. With each rejection, the potential gains decrease significantly.  It's time to push for a more favorable outcome while there's still a decent amount to negotiate for."
