"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to take 9000 dollars for myself and leave 1000 dollars for Bob. This should leave him with a decent amount, while also securing the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share again, but still maintain a significant advantage. This time, I'll take $8000 and give Bob $2000.  This should be a more enticing offer for him than the last round, and it still gives me a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is better than the previous one, I'm still hoping for a better deal. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I believe I can still get more than $2000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share again to try and find a middle ground. This time, I'll take $7000 and give Bob $3000.  The inflation is making the money worth less, but I still think I can get a good share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is getting better from Bob's perspective, but it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep playing to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to keep reducing my share, but this is the last time. If Bob rejects this, I'm afraid we'll both lose a lot of money due to inflation. I'm offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob.  I hope he'll accept."
