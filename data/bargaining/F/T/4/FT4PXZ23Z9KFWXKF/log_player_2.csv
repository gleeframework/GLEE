Alice's offer:

Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the fairness you offered, but I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more balanced, considering the inflation rate you'll face in future rounds.  Let's see if we can agree.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we both want a larger piece of the pie.  However, the longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for me. I propose a 50/50 split to ensure we both benefit significantly. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
