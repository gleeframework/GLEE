Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fairness you offered, but I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more balanced, considering the inflation rate you'll face in future rounds.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
