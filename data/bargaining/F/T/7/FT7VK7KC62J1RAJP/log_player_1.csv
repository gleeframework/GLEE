"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to take a very greedy approach and offer Bob just $1. I'm hoping he'll either accept this small offer or realize that if he rejects it, he'll be in a much worse position in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more money for myself, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  In the next round, inflation would significantly devalue my earnings, and I'm not guaranteed a better deal. This offer, while not ideal, is a reasonable compromise."
