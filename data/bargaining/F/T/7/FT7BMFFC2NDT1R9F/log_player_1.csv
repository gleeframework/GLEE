Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a highly asymmetric split. I'll take nearly everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept quickly and avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see if he's willing to play along!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, it's better to secure a 50/50 split now than risk further inflation and potential losses in future rounds."
