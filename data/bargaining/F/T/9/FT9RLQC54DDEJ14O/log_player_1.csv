"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me (Alice) receiving $90 and Bob receiving $10. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant advantage while still giving Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it seems like a fair split given the inflation, I believe I can do better in the upcoming rounds. I will propose a more favorable split for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  While the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering Bob's previous offer, and it still allows for a significant gain for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the value of the money has decreased significantly, accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount, and it's more favorable than risking further inflation and potential losses."
