"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering we both need to agree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 55/45 split, especially since I was hoping for a more even split or a slight bias in my favor. I'd rather take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal, even considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm taking into account the 20% decrease in value from the first round, and the 20% decrease from the second round, so the money is now worth 64% of its original value. I'm offering a slightly more generous split to Bob compared to my first offer, hoping he'll accept this one. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
