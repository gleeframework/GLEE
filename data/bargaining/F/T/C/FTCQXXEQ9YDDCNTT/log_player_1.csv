Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to go, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for Alice, making this even split the most advantageous choice at this point."
