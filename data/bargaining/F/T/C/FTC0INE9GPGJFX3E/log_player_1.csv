"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering you $30, and I'll take $70. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not satisfied with the ratio, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, hoping that the equal division will be more appealing to Bob this time."
