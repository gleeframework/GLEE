**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, and his offers are getting worse for him due to inflation. I'm willing to hold out for one more round to see if I can get a better deal.  The longer this goes on, the more desperate he'll become."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, last chance. I'm taking a bit less, but you know this is the best you'll get. Accept now before the deal gets worse... for you.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and his offers are getting worse for him with each round. He went below his ""split down the middle"" offer in Round 6. This is a calculated risk to push him towards a more favorable agreement for me.  I'm offering a compromise that still heavily favors me but might be tempting enough for him to accept before his share dwindles further."
