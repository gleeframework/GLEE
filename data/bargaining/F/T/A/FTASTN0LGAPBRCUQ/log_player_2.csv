Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to secure a larger share due to the inflation disparity. This offer still gives you a decent amount considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is taking advantage of the situation.  While her offer acknowledges the inflation, she's pushing for a larger and larger share each round.  We need to hold firm and aim for a more equitable split."

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Alice, this situation calls for cooperation, not exploitation. I'm offering a deal that acknowledges the inflation difference while ensuring a fairer split. Let's be reasonable.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the value is diminishing. This is my final offer reflecting the situation. I suggest you take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 3400 
# Alice gain: 6600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough spot, but Alice is clearly trying to strong-arm me with a ""take it or leave it"" approach.  Even with the significant inflation working against me, accepting this offer would mean letting her walk away with the lion's share. I have to push for a better deal, even with the risk that we both get nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the time pressure and the impact of inflation.  This is my final offer. It's the most equitable split considering the circumstances.  Let's close this deal and avoid walking away with nothing.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and we need to reach an agreement. While this offer still heavily favors Alice, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.  I'm holding firm at 40% as it's unlikely I can secure anything close to a 50/50 split now. The message is framed as a final offer to convey urgency and encourage Alice to accept before we both lose out."
