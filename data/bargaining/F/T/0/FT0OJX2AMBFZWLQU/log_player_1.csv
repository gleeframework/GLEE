"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, a relatively even split to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more this time.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement before the money starts to lose too much value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, as I'd like to get a bit more. The money is losing value quickly, and I'd like to negotiate for a better deal. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time. 50-50 seems fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more moderate offer."
