"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk too 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd rather not give up such a large majority to him. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 0.8). I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time, but I still want a decent amount. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, but I'll give you a tiny bit 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (80% * 0.64 * 0.8). Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about the tiny amount I'd get, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1600,
  ""bob_gain"": 8400,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still want to get something. Can we make a deal before it's too late?""
}

Your turn, Bob!"
