"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100, and Bob will get the remaining 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain in Round 2 is worth 10% less than in Round 1, so I'll calculate my gain in terms of the original $100.

In Round 1, I proposed a gain of $70, which is worth 70% of $100. In Round 2, I would get 70% of $90 (10% less than $100 due to inflation), which is $63.

Bob's offer is for me to gain $40, which is 40% of $100. In terms of the original $100, this is worth $40.

Since I would be getting $63 in my previous proposal, and Bob is offering me $40, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain in Round 3 is worth 10% less than in Round 2. In Round 2, I would have gotten $63 in terms of the original $100. In Round 3, I would get 63% of $90 (10% less than $100 due to inflation), which is $56.70.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $100, and Bob will get the remaining 45%."
