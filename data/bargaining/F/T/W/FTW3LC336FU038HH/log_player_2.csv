Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is trying to get a better deal now that the money is worth less. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money I gain is worth 19% less, I'm actually getting 40.5 in terms of the original value, and Alice is getting 45, which is worth 40.25 in the original value. This offer is actually quite close to the original 50-50 split, but I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining value.
