"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a tough one! While Alice's offer is extremely generous, it's important to consider the game mechanics. 

* **Inflation:** Even though Alice's offer seems huge right now, the value of that dollar will decrease significantly with each passing round.
* **Control:** Rejecting the offer gives Bob the power to propose in the next round. This might give him a better chance to secure a larger share.

By rejecting, Bob gains the upper hand in the negotiation."
