"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, take it or leave it!""
}
```

This offer is quite aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Fairness is a good approach, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation in mind, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a smaller share, but it's still better than nothing!""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 20% inflation and aims to maximize my gain."
