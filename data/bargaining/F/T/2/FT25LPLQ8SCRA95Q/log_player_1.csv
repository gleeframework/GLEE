"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with an even split.  We can adjust later if we want. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not too thrilled about the even split, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
