"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
 
 I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point given the potential for inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the most strategic choice. With the money losing value each round, it's not guaranteed I'll get a better offer in the future."
