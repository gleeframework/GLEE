"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a warning, implying that I'm not willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, and the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: 500,000 / 0.95 = 526,315.79
Bob gain: 500,000 / 0.95 = 526,315.79

I accept Bob's offer.
