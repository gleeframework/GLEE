"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

After considering Bob's new offer, I decide to reject it. I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split, and I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in round 2, so it's worth 5% of 5% less than the original amount, which is 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my efforts. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $190,000 and keeping $810,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a compromise and a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's new offer, I notice that it's actually an improvement from his previous offer. I'm willing to accept a 40/60 split, so I'll accept his offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
