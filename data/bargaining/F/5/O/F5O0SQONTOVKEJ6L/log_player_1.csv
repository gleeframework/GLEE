"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'm willing to compromise, but I want a more balanced split. I'll wait for my turn to make a new offer in the next round."

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but still want a fair share""}

I'm increasing my offer by $500, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this compromise!"

# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting less and less appealing!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. The gap between our proposed shares is getting too large, and I'm not willing to accept a 62/38 split. I'll keep trying to find a more balanced compromise."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:
