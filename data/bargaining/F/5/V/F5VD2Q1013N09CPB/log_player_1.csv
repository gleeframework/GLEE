Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer and let's be done with it. It's more than fair, even with the inflation.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, enough is enough. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
At this point, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer. Even though I've been holding out for a larger share, the inflation is significantly impacting Bob's gains, and the risk of getting nothing is too high. Accepting the 50/50 split guarantees a substantial amount of money, which is better than risking everything."
