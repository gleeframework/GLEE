I propose to take 999,999 dollars and give Bob just 1 dollar.  This is a pretty bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to play along."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to stick with my original offer.  Even though Bob rejected it, I'm betting that he'll realize it's in his best interest to take the small amount now rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While I don't know the exact effect of inflation on Bob, it's clear he's trying to squeeze me out of the deal. I'm willing to wait and see if he makes a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm switching to a more balanced approach.  Given the inflation and Bob's stubbornness, it seems like a 50/50 split is the fairest and most likely to be accepted."
