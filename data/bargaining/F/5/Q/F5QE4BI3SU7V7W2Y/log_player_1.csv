"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has taken a toll, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Since my money is worth 10% less than in Round 1, and 20% less than the original $100, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy again.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
