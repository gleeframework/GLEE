Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor this time.  Time is running out, and this ensures a decent outcome for both of us before inflation eats away at the value.

# Alice gain: 55
