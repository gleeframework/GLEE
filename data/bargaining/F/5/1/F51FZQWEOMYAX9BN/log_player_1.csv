"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can end the game now.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, Alice. Let's end this game now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the effects of inflation.

The initial $1,000,000 is now worth 95% of its original value due to the 5% decrease, so I'll get 0.95 \* 400,000 = 380,000.

For Bob, the money is worth 90% of its original value due to the 10% decrease, so he'll get 0.9 \* 600,000 = 540,000.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, Bob. Let's see if you'll accept this one.""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give Bob, hoping he'll accept this offer."
