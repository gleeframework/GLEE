I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer in my favor, knowing that the money is worth less to Bob with each round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more, this is a good deal for me considering the inflation. Each round, the money is worth less to me, so I'll take what I can get."
