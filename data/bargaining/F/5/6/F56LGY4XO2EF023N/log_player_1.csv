"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 7:3. You get 300k, I get 700k. We can end the game now.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which is a fair and reasonable division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think splitting it down the middle is a good idea, as it doesn't take into account the inflation factor. If we split it down the middle now, I'll be getting less than 500,000, which is a worse deal for me than my original offer. I'd like to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, I'll take 600k. It's a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to account for the 20% inflation, and I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting less than me, but I'll give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This offer is still a 3:5 split, which is not favorable to me. The fact that Bob is offering me a ""slightly better deal"" is just a way of saying he's giving me a tiny bit more than before, but still less than what I initially offered. I'd like to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 450k, I'll take 550k. It's a fair deal considering the inflation and the previous offers.""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
