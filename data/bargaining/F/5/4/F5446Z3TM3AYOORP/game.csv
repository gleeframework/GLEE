7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the money with a 7:3 ratio. This is a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in each subsequent round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"I'll take a 50/50 split, but I think we can do better than that. Let's try to get a higher ratio in the next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose a 6:4 split. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for the decreasing value of money in each round.",Alice,3,
