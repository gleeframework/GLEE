"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, as I'm only losing 5% per round while you lose 20%. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, considering the significant difference in our inflation rates. I believe I can propose a better split that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when I can make my proposal for Round 2."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think a 52/48 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share, and it accounts for the higher depreciation on my side.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's response to this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic. We both lose value every round, so a 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get as much as possible. We can continue to bargain, but the longer we wait, the less we'll get. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable offer at this point. Continuing to bargain might lead to further losses for both of us, so it's best to accept this offer and ensure we both get a fair share of what's left.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of the game based on this decision."
