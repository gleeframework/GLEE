"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation rates, I think a 52/48 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share, and it accounts for the higher depreciation on my side. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
