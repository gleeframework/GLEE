55.0,45.0,"Let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, as I'm only losing 5% per round while you lose 20%.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
48.0,52.0,"Considering the inflation rates, I think a 52/48 split in my favor is more reasonable. This way, we both get a significant share, and it accounts for the higher depreciation on my side.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's be realistic. We both lose value every round, so a 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get as much as possible. We can continue to bargain, but the longer we wait, the less we'll get.",Alice,3,
