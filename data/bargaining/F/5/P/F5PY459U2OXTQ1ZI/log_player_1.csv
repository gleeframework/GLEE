"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share to start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but with a slight bias towards me to set the tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this round, but I'm expecting a better offer next time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the effective values are:

My gain: $400,000 (pre-inflation) * 0.8 = $320,000
Bob's gain: $600,000 (pre-inflation) * 0.9 = $540,000

Considering Bob's message, I sense that he's trying to test my willingness to negotiate. I'll respond with a counteroffer that's slightly better for me, but still reasonable.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with such a large share going to you this early on. I'll offer 420000 to me and 580000 to you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob again.

My gain: $420,000 (pre-inflation) * 0.8 = $336,000
Bob's gain: $580,000 (pre-inflation) * 0.9 = $522,000

Considering the previous rounds, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, but still be mindful of the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more generous, but the money's losing value fast. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob.

My gain: $480,000 (pre-inflation) * 0.5162 = $247,424
Bob's gain: $520,000 (pre-inflation) * 0.729 = $378,480

Considering the decreasing value of the money, Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly better for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to give up that much. I'll offer 460000 to me and 540000 to you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 49.3% less for me and 27.4% less for Bob.

My gain: $460,000 (pre-inflation) * 0.5077 = $233,556
Bob's gain: $540,000 (pre-inflation) * 0.729 = $393,060

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, but still be mindful of the limited time left.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it down the middle, but I'm not getting any younger either!""
