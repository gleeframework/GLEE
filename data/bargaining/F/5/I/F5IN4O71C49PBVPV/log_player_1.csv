I'm not satisfied with this offer. Bob is only offering me 30% of the total, which is a very unfair split. I think I deserve a bigger share, especially considering the money is worth 5% less than before. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."

I'm extremely disappointed with this offer. The money is worth even less now, and Bob is only offering me 20% of the total. I think this is an outrageously unfair split, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll have to try to do better in the next round."

I'm appalled by this offer. The money is worth even less now, and Bob is only offering me a paltry 10% of the total. This is an insult. I'm not going to accept an offer that's so grossly unfair. I'll have to keep pushing for a better deal."

I'm extremely frustrated with this offer. The money is worth almost a third less than it was initially, and Bob is only offering me a minuscule 5% of the total. This is an outrage.
