Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer ensures that Alice gets the most possible money in this round, and the very small offer to Bob gives an incentive for him to potentially reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
