"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm proposing a slightly more aggressive offer, taking a slightly larger share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because the money is worth significantly less now, and I don't think I can do better. 38 is a decent share, considering the reduced value of the money."
