"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good start, let's see what you do next!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it more evenly, and we can both get a good chunk of money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the offer.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, and I'd like to keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You said we could do better, so I'm making a more even split. Your turn again!""
}
```

I'm trying to stay firm on the division, but still be reasonable. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it down the middle. We're both losing value with each round, so we can both maximize our gains with an even split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger toll on my gain, I think it's time to consider a more even split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the even split. It's not the best I could have gotten, but it's a decent compromise given the circumstances."
