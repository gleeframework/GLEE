"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty lopsided offer in my favor, knowing that the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, accepting this offer is the best option.  The money is worth less in each round, and if I reject, I run the risk of a worse offer in the next round."
