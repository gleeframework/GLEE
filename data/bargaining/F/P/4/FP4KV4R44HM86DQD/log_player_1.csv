"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you take 40. It's a good starting point!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm willing to split it 55/45, with me taking the larger share. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll stick with the same valuation. However, I'm not convinced that 45 is the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, 55/45. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
