I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I want to maximize my share in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less for me in each subsequent round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  My share is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so 9000 would now be worth 8100.  Bob's offer of 5000 is greater than that, so it's in my best interest to accept."
