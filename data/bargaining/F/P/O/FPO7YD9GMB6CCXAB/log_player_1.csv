"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get the majority, but it's a fair start""
}
```

This way, I get a decent amount to start with, and Bob gets a fair share as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm not giving up yet. My turn to take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the aggressive offer from Bob in the previous round, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, let's keep negotiating. I think we can find a better deal 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the value of money is decreasing rapidly. Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if I should accept it.

However, I'm getting a bit desperate, and the value of the money is decreasing quickly. I'll try to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise in the next round.
