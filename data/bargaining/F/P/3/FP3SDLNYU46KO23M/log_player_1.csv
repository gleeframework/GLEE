I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent amount while still ensuring a majority for me.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 400,000 dollars and keep 600,000 for myself.  It's a bit less than my initial offer, but with the value dropping so quickly, I want to get something secured before we lose too much.  Let's see if he's more agreeable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the value is dropping fast, and Bob's offer is a decent amount. Accepting this secures a good portion of the money before it loses much more value."
