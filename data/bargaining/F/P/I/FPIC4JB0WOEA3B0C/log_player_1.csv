"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting a fair split, but also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more considering the current economic situation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 3200
Bob gain: 4800

I'm not happy with this offer, as I think I'm being offered too little. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with this offer, I think I deserve more considering the initial amount was $10,000.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, the current amount is worth 80% of the original, so it's now $8,000.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think I should get a slight majority.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a significant portion of the remaining money, but I'm keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle, but I think we should split it 50/50 to avoid further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 48.8% decrease in value due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 1600
Bob gain: 1600

I think this is a reasonable offer, and splitting it 50/50 seems fair. I'm willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
