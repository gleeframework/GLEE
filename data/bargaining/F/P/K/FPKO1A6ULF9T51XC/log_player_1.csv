"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this round, but I'll give you a higher share later 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20-80 split, but I'm willing to consider Bob's proposal. I'll accept the offer for now, hoping that Bob will make good on his promise to give me a higher share later.
