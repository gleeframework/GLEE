Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement. Let's split this evenly and avoid the risk of getting nothing. This is the fairest offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
At this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Severely Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is significantly eating into my potential gains. Accepting $50 now is better than holding out for a slightly larger share that will be worth significantly less due to inflation.
* **Risk of Losing Everything:**  We're halfway through the rounds.  If I continue to reject offers and don't reach an agreement with Bob, we both get nothing. 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal considering the initial disadvantage, the time pressure and inflation make it the safest and most rational option at this stage."
