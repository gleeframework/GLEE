# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer since it's not significantly better than my initial offer, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

Round 5

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is plummeting! Given that my gain is only 5 dollars more than in Bob's previous offer, and considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll think carefully before making a decision. However, since this is the last round before the money's value becomes negligible, I'll accept this offer to get something rather than risking waiting for an even worse deal.
