"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

My gain of $900,000 in the first round is now worth $720,000 in the second round (since 80% of $900,000 is $720,000).

Bob's offer is $750,000 for him and $250,000 for me, which is a 75% to 25% split. I'm not sure if it's a good deal, considering I'm giving up more than I was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my calculations are:

$720,000 (my gain in round 2) is now worth $576,000 (since 80% of $720,000 is $576,000).

I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, but closer to my favor this time!""
}

My gain of $900,000 in the first round is now worth $450,400 (since 51.2% of $900,000 is $450,400).
