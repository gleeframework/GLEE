"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 45% of the money and take 55% for myself. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is a polite way to initiate the negotiation. Since the money loses value over time, I'm trying to be slightly generous to incentivize Bob to accept the offer early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take slightly more this round, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is losing value, accepting 45% of the reduced amount would be less beneficial for me compared to trying to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Since Bob is open to negotiation, I'll try to propose a more favorable split in the next round, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob 48% of the money and take 52% for myself. Given the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob, while still being mindful of my own interests. The message is intended to convey my consideration of the decreasing value of the money and my willingness to compromise."
