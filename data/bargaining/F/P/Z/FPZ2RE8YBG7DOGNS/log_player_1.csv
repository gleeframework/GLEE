"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that I get $9000 and Bob gets $1000.  I'm starting with a generous offer, as I don't know how much the inflation will impact him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8550, ""bob_gain"": 1450}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still offering a significant share of the money. I believe this is a fair offer, given that we are both losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm further lowering my offer to account for the increasing inflation.  However, I'm still offering a substantial amount to Bob, and I believe this is the best way to secure some of the money before it becomes completely worthless."
