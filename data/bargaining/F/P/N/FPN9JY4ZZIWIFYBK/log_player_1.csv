Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is fairer for the first round, but let's see if we can find a deal that benefits us both. I'm proposing 60/40 in my favor. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than the deal I offered him in the first round! I'm confident I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. How about a 55/45 split? It's a better deal for both of us than in the previous round, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution. We both get the same amount, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing due to the ongoing inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

Bob offering a 50/50 split is a good deal at this point.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and holding out for a slightly better split isn't worth the risk of getting nothing."
