"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's making the big sacrifice here. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although Bob is offering me a smaller share, the difference between $200,000 and $800,000 is not significant enough to make me accept. I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I'm not getting left with nothing.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob the larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a small consolation prize, but I'm not giving up my majority share yet. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money worth less and less each round, I need to be careful. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although I'm desperate for some money, $100,000 is not enough to make it worth giving up on the majority share. I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to get a decent share for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and getting a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob than my previous ones."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny share, but I'm not giving up my majority share yet, and I'm not getting taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money worth so much less, I need to be extremely careful. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because $50,000 is not even close to being a decent share, considering the inflation and the fact that I'm being offered a tiny fraction of the total. I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the lion's share, but I need something for my efforts.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money at this point, given the inflation. I'm offering Bob the majority share, but I'm still trying to get a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a token amount, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of anymore. 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really ravaging my potential gains! With the money worth so much less, I need to be extremely cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because $10,000 is essentially nothing at this point, considering the inflation and the fact that I'm being offered a token amount. I'm hoping to do better in the next round, but I'm running out of options."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 20000,
  ""bob_gain"": 980000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take whatever I can get at this point.""
}
```

I'm being extremely realistic at this point, considering the massive inflation and the fact that I'm running out of time. I'm offering Bob the majority share, and I'm taking a tiny fraction of the remaining amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle this."
