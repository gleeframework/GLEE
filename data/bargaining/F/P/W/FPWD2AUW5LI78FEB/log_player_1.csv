"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which I believe is a reasonable and generous offer. I'm open to negotiations, but I hope Bob will see the fairness in this proposal and accept it. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%"" is a brief explanation of my reasoning behind this offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds to this proposal. Will he accept it, or will we proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  How about a slightly better deal for me this time, since the pot is shrinking? 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob has made a counteroffer of $4,750 for me and $5,250 for himself, I need to consider whether this division is acceptable to me. Given that the money is worth 5% less in this round due to inflation, I have to take that into account when evaluating the offer.\n\n###\n\nAfter considering Bob's proposal, I've decided to reject it. Although the offer is closer to an equal split than my initial proposal, I believe there is still room for negotiation, especially considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. I will make a new proposal for dividing the remaining amount, taking into account the reduced value due to inflation.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI'll send my new proposal, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since we're now in the third round, the money is worth 10% less than its original value (5% decrease in each of the first two rounds).\n\n###\n\nI'll propose a division that takes this decrease in value into account while still trying to find a mutually acceptable split.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds to this offer. Will he accept it, or will we proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, the money's getting smaller! 
# Alice gain: 5125 
# Bob gain: 4875 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, which has now reduced the value of the money by 14.26% compared to the first round, I need to carefully evaluate Bob's latest offer. The division proposed by Bob is $5,125 for me and $4,875 for himself.\n\n###\n\nGiven that this is Bob's ""final offer"" and the decreasing value of the money, I must weigh the pros and cons of accepting this proposal versus continuing negotiations. Further rounds will only decrease the value of the money more, potentially leading to less favorable outcomes for both of us.\n\n###\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. The difference in our proposed divisions is relatively small, and the negative impact of further inflation on the money's value makes it prudent to conclude the negotiations at this point.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI believe accepting this offer is the most reasonable decision under the current circumstances, as it brings the negotiations to a close before the value of the money decreases further."
