"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original 100$, which is 40$. This leaves me with 60$, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it closer to 50/50 this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money is worth less, so my gain of 45 is actually worth 45 * 0.9 = 40.5. Bob's gain of 55 is worth 55 * 0.9 = 49.5.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
