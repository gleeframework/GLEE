Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 100,000$ is a lot of money, it's worth negotiating for a better share.  There's a lot of rounds left and I can try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a 50/50 split.  It's a fair offer and hopefully, Alice will see the value in ending the game now."
