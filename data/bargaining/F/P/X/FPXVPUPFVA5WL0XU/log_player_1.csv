I propose to keep 990,000$ for myself and give Bob 10,000$.  This is a fairly generous offer to start, hoping for a quick agreement.  Let's see if he takes it!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json

We're nearing the end of the game, and the inflation is starting to bite.  To secure some money, I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, giving him 150,000. This is a significant portion, but I need to ensure I get the majority of the remaining money. Let's see if he finally accepts."
