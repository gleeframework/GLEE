"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I need to consider the actual value of the offer. 

If I take 250,000, it's equivalent to 300,000 in the first round, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, the money is worth 40% of its initial value due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

I'm offering to take 40% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving 60% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less in the fourth round, I need to consider the actual value of the offer.

If I take 200,000, it's equivalent to 384,615 in the first round, which is a relatively small amount compared to my initial offer.

However, considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept Bob's offer.
