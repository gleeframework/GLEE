"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair for me to get a slightly bigger share since I'm making the proposal now. Let's move forward with this split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to consider this when evaluating the offer.

In the first round, I would have gotten 50 dollars, which is still 50 dollars in this round. Bob's offer is 40 dollars, which is 80% of 50 dollars. That's a pretty good deal for me, considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
