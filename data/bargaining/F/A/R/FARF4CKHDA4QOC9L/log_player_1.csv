I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation if we continue to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to concede some ground, but I still believe a 60/40 split is fair. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before inflation eats away at our gains further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is still unfavorable, and the inflation is getting out of hand. I believe we can still reach a more equitable deal if we keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With the inflation rate increasing, we're approaching a point where a 50/50 split is the most logical option.  Let's split the remaining money evenly and avoid further losses."
