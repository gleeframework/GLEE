55.0,45.0,"Let's be fair, Alice. Time is ticking and the value decreases rapidly. This offer ensures we both benefit.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the sentiment, but this offer isn't as fair as it seems given the rapid depreciation of your share. Let's find a solution that benefits us both more equitably.",Alice,2,reject

60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and a 50/50 split just hurts us both at this point. This offer still gives you a decent share, even considering the depreciation.",Alice,5,
