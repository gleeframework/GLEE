I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate in the next round if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to see he's willing to negotiate, his offer is still too low. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but I believe it's fair given the inflation and that I'm the one making the offer this round."
