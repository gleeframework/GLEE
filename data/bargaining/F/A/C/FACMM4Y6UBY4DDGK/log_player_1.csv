"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me the majority of the money ($9000), leaving Bob with $1000. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as it's a fairly generous offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I offered him in the first round, even with the 10% inflation. I will reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is still more than he offered me in the last round. This should make him feel like he's getting a better deal, while still giving me a good amount of money."
