"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair at first glance,  I know the inflation will hit me harder than Alice. I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm taking into account the inflation rates and proposing a more favorable split for myself. Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is taking its toll.  Accepting this offer gives me a decent amount, and with each passing round, my share will continue to decrease.  It's time to take what I can get."
