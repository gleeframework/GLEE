"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to respond.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting the effort I put in to this game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, $6,000 was 60% of $10,000. With 5% inflation, $6,000 is now worth 57.5% of the original amount. So, to keep the same value, I'd need to aim for a higher percentage.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to reject it since I'm getting a smaller percentage than I would have liked.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the decreasing value of the money. Since the money is worth 5% less each round, I'll try to get a larger share in the current round.

I'll offer Bob $5,000 and keep $5,000 for myself. This way, I'll be getting a larger share in the current round, but I'll have to be prepared to negotiate further in future rounds.
