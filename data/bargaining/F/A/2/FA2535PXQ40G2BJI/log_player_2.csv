Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. This is my new deal. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Every round, Bob's potential earnings decrease significantly due to inflation. Holding out for a better offer in the future is becoming increasingly risky.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows Bob is getting desperate. It's unlikely she will offer anything significantly better than this, especially if she believes Bob might accept out of fear of losing even more value. 

While 3800 is significantly less than what Bob could have gotten in earlier rounds, it's better to take this offer than risk getting even less in a future round."
