"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is extremely unfair. I will reject it and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I am offering Alice 100,000 and keeping 900,000 for myself. This is a fair offer, as it gives Alice a significant portion of the money while ensuring that I receive the majority."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I still prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is significantly better than the previous round.  It's important to remember that the money Alice gains is worth less now, and the number of rounds is limited. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure some money."
