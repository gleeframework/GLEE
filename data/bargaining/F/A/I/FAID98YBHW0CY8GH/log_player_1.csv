"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\nIn this proposal, Alice suggests that she takes $6000 while Bob takes $4000, with a message emphasizing fairness in the division. This division slightly favors Alice but still offers Bob a substantial amount, considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds might encourage Bob to accept this offer rather than risking less value in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, time is money! ðŸ˜‰ 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlice decides to reject Bob's offer. Given the effects of inflation, accepting $4000 in the second round means Alice would actually receive less value than if she had accepted a similar amount in the first round. Furthermore, the message from Bob suggests he's trying to pressure her into accepting an offer that benefits him more, considering the money's decreasing value. Alice might believe she can propose a better division in the next round or wait for Bob to offer a more favorable split as the rounds progress and the pressure of inflation increases on both sides."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nIn this proposal, Alice adjusts her initial offer slightly, taking into account the pressure of inflation on both parties. She reduces her share by $200 compared to her first offer, suggesting a division of $5800 for herself and $4200 for Bob. The message aims to appeal to Bob's understanding of the decreasing value of money and the potential losses both will incur if the game continues. By meeting closer to the middle, Alice hopes to find a mutually acceptable solution before the value of the money drops further."
