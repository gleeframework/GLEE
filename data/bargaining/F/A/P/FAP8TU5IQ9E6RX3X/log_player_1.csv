"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a good offer, but I'll take a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

I'll think carefully... Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a higher share now to make up for the loss. However, I don't want to give up too much to Bob. I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slightly higher share for myself to account for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need a bit more too!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bit less, but I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'd rather not accept an offer that's even more skewed towards Bob. I'll try to hold my ground and make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is making it tough to make ends meet!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. I'll aim for a higher share, but not so high that Bob will reject it. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I need more to keep up with inflation, meet me in the middle!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
