"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 and take 60. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken its toll, and my share is worth less than before.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 20% of the remaining money. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. 55% is my minimum.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% and taking 55% for myself, trying to balance the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take what's left. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings. With my share worth only 14.26% less than the original, I'm not thrilled about getting only 10% of the remaining money.

However, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer from Bob. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation.
