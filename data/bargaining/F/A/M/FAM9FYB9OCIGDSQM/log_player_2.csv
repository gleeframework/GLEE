"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives us both a good chunk of money. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, I, Bob, am offered $350,000 while Alice takes $650,000. Given that with each passing round the money's value decreases by 5% for me and 20% for Alice, there's an incentive to negotiate for a better split, especially since we have 12 rounds and both of us lose if no agreement is reached by the end. Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to propose a counteroffer that could potentially increase my share, leveraging the fact that Alice loses more value with each round. This strategic decision aims to maximize my gain while considering the decreasing value of money over rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's adjust the split to reflect the decreasing value over rounds.""}\n\nReasoning: Given that Alice loses more value with each round (20% compared to my 5%), my counteroffer aims to capitalize on this disparity. By proposing a split of $450,000 for myself and $550,000 for Alice, I'm applying pressure on Alice to consider a more balanced division, taking into account the devaluation of money in subsequent rounds. This offer still gives Alice a larger share but begins to close the gap, reflecting the urgency and the impact of inflation on our negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the time pressure, Bob, but your offer was a bit too skewed. This is more balanced. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Despite the adjustment in Alice's offer, giving me $400,000 and herself $600,000, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Considering the significant impact of inflation on Alice's potential gain (36% decrease in value since the first round) compared to mine (9.75% decrease), I'm inclined to push for a more favorable split. The decreasing value of money, especially for Alice, with each passing round, puts pressure on her to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. By rejecting this offer, I aim to use this pressure to negotiate a better deal in the next round, potentially leveraging Alice's increasing urgency to finalize the division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I believe this split is more reflective of our current situation.""}\n\nReasoning: Given the increasing pressure of inflation on both our shares, but significantly more so on Alice's, I've decided to propose a split that gives me $475,000 and Alice $525,000. This offer takes into account the urgency for both of us to reach an agreement, considering we've already reached the fourth round and the value of money continues to decrease. By slightly increasing my share from the previous offers, I'm testing Alice's willingness to compromise further, given the substantial decrease in her potential gain's value (36% less than the initial round). This strategic move aims to find a balance between maximizing my gain and acknowledging the time-sensitive nature of our negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It accounts for the inflation but is still fair to both of us. We need to reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nReasoning: Given the current state of negotiations and the significant impact of inflation on the value of money for both of us, I've decided to accept Alice's offer of $430,000 for myself and $570,000 for her. At this point, we are in the fifth round, and the money's value has decreased substantially, especially for Alice, whose share is now worth 59.04% less than in the first round. Considering Alice has framed this as her final offer and the pressure is on both of us to reach an agreement before the value of money decreases further or we reach the 12-round limit, accepting this offer seems prudent. It balances the need to maximize my gain with the risk of losing everything if no agreement is reached. The difference in the offers has narrowed significantly, and the risk of further negotiations not yielding a substantially better outcome for me, combined with the potential for Alice to stick to her ""final offer,"" leads me to conclude that accepting this offer is the best strategic decision at this juncture."
