I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split, giving me the lion's share. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept this offer. I might be able to get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This time I'm offering a 6000/4000 split. This is still a good deal for me, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. Maybe Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and accept."
