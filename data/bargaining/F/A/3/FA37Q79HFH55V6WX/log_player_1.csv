Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a fair deal right from the start!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous proposal, and I still have the opportunity to make a counter-offer. I'm not going to accept this deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to stick with a similar split, but lower Bob's share slightly since his offer was so unfair. Hopefully, he'll realize it's in his best interest to take this deal before we lose more money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, especially considering how much the money is now worth less for me due to inflation. I'm not going to settle for anything less than a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my proposed share slightly again, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will finally recognize that his offers are not going to get him a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 640000 
# Bob gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough, especially considering how much less my share is worth now due to inflation.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a more fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to make another small concession, but I'm still going to hold out for a better deal than Bob has been offering. I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, but I'm not going to give up yet."
