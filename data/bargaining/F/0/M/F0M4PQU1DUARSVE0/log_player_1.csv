"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less for both of us.

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'd like to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take a slightly smaller share, hoping to meet Bob in the middle and make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can smell it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not getting desperate yet, and I think I can do better than this. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Time for a tiebreaker! Let's call it a draw!""
}
```

I'm making a final push for a 50/50 split, hoping to break the stalemate and end the game on a high note!"
