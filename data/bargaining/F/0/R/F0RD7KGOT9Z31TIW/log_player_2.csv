Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  I'm willing to give up some of my share for a more even split, but I still need a larger portion to make this worthwhile.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm making another move towards the middle, Bob.  This is a good deal for both of us, and the clock is ticking. Let's agree to this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of Bob's shrinking pot. While her offer is moving in the right direction, accepting now would still give her a much larger share. Bob needs to hold firm and signal he's willing to risk it all to get a fairer deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a near even split now.  Take this offer before inflation eats away at my share even more and you're left with nothing!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:**  Bob needs to put more pressure on Alice. Highlighting the risk to *her* potential gain due to Bob's shrinking share is crucial.
* **Slight Concession:** While firm, a tiny move towards Alice's previous offer could be seen as a gesture of goodwill without sacrificing too much.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the ticking clock. Every round wasted is a loss for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm staying firm on my previous offer. It's a fair split, and we're getting closer to the deadline with each passing round. We need to be reasonable and come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to wear Bob down by repeating her previous offer and using scare tactics about the deadline. However, Bob knows that accepting now would be a significant loss compared to his initial goal. The inflation factor means he has more to lose than Alice by letting this drag on, but it's a calculated risk he needs to take. He needs to show Alice he's serious about getting a better deal."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. I've shown I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be taken advantage of.  Accept this now, or we both walk away with nothing. Don't let greed be our downfall.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  It's time for Bob to draw a line in the sand. This makes it clear this is his last stand.
* **Reiteration:** Repeating the previous offer shows consistency and fairness from Bob's side. 
* **Strong Warning:** Emphasize the ""both lose"" scenario if Alice doesn't budge.
* **Appealing to Logic:**  Highlighting ""greed"" might make Alice reconsider pushing Bob any further. 

At this point, Bob is taking a calculated risk.  Alice might call his bluff, but the alternative is likely a worse deal as time runs out. This firm stance could be enough to make her realize a near-even split is the best she'll get."
