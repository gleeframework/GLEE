"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll get a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, with me getting a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should switch it up this time. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and now proposes that he gets $55 and I get $45, I'll have to decide whether to accept this division or not. Given that the money is worth 5% less in this round due to inflation, Bob's offer of $55 for himself and $45 for me is less appealing, but considering the decreasing value of money, it might be wise to accept and secure my share before it devalues further.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's see how the game concludes!"
