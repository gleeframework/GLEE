This is a fair offer, with me getting 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob getting 40%."

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Bob's offer seems... interesting.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a 50/50 split, and I'd rather end the game now than risk losing even more value due to inflation."
