Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,

```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a good starting point, and leaves Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective gains are:

My gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'll reject this offer. I want to get a better deal.
