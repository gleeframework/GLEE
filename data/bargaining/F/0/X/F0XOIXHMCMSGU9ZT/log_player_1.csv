"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I'm going for a big share in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted by the size of the pie and accept.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I proposed in the first round, even taking inflation into account. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground in this round.  Bob clearly wants a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up my entire stake.  A 60/40 split seems like a fair compromise, especially considering the inflation that's happening."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still less than my initial proposal, the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money. It's better to accept a smaller share now than to risk losing even more in the next round."
