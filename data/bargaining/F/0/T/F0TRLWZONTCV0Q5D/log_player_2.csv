Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nGiven the cumulative effect of inflation, with the money now worth 22.78% less for me than in the first round, I need to adjust my strategy to try and secure a more favorable split.\n\n###\nHere's my offer:\n{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I believe this offer is a critical compromise.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is becoming ridiculous. The longer we wait, the less you get. I'm offering you a round number - take it before it shrinks even further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\nI'll evaluate the offer considering the current state of inflation.\n\n###\nGiven that the money is now worth 26.49% less for me, Alice's offer of $400,000 is actually equivalent to approximately $294,020 in the first round's value.\n\n###\nHowever, it's also important to consider that each subsequent round will further decrease the value of the money for me, while Alice's gain remains unaffected by inflation.\n\n###\nAt this point, the difference in our proposed splits is not significantly large, and the risk of further devaluation might outweigh the potential benefits of holding out for a slightly better deal.\n\n###\nConsidering these factors, I'll decide to accept Alice's offer to secure a guaranteed gain, albeit reduced by inflation.\n\n###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nLet's conclude the game!"
