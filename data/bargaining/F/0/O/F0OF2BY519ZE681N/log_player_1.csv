"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather not take a 20% hit on the value of my share. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to maximize my gain.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With my share still worth the same as in the first round, I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, trying to maximize my gain while still giving Bob a reasonable share."
