I propose Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates we'll face in subsequent rounds."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is not acceptable. While I understand the impact of inflation, Bob's offer is exploitative and severely undervalues my share. I will continue to negotiate for a fairer division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000} 
```

I propose Alice receives $650,000 and Bob receives $350,000.  While the inflation has been significant, I'm willing to take a smaller share to reach an agreement. It's time to end this negotiation, as the continued losses due to inflation are not sustainable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is insulting. It's clear he's trying to exploit the situation with inflation. While I understand the impact of inflation, this offer is completely unreasonable. I won't accept such a blatant attempt at manipulation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  At this point, inflation has eroded the value of the money significantly for both of us.  A fair split is the only way to ensure we both avoid further losses. This is the most equitable solution given the current circumstances."
