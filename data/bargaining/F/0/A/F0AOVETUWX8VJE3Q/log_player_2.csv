"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal divides the money equally after adjusting for inflation in the next round. Accept if fair. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer seems fair at first glance, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Alice's offer favors her significantly due to the inflated value of the money in the next round. It's in Bob's best interest to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""This proposal takes into account the future inflation. I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's end this game and share the money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal aims for an equal division considering the inflation effect on future rounds. Accept for a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a fair one considering the inflation factor. While the initial proposal was skewed in her favor, the 36% reduction in value of her share in this round makes it a much more balanced proposal.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept and avoid further risk of further inflation in future rounds."
