"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, but I'm trying to get a good chunk of the money upfront to account for the potential inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In Round 1, my gain of $800,000 was worth $800,000. In Round 2, the money is worth 10% less, so my gain of $400,000 is equivalent to $400,000 / 0.9 = $444,444.44 in Round 1 terms.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
