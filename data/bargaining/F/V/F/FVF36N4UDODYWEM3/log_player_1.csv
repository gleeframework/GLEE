Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive offer. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a smaller share, especially since he doesn't experience inflation. Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting risky, but Bob's offer is fair. Accepting now prevents the chance of getting nothing in the end, and I'm not confident in my ability to get a better offer in the next round with the inflation penalty."
