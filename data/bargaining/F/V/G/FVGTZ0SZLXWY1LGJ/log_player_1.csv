Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a tough start. I understand you want a larger share, but I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It accounts for the risk I'm taking by proposing second, and it leaves us with a good amount before inflation eats away at it.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
