""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's a tough start. I understand you want a larger share, but I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It accounts for the risk I'm taking by proposing second, and it leaves us with a good amount before inflation eats away at it.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's try a 70/30 split. This gives you a decent share and avoids further inflation.  It's time to be realistic and get this done. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000
