900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can negotiate from there.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, that's a tough start. I understand you want a larger share, but I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It accounts for the risk I'm taking by proposing second, and it leaves us with a good amount before inflation eats away at it.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal.",Bob,2,

700000.0,300000.0,"Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's try a 70/30 split. This gives you a decent share and avoids further inflation.  It's time to be realistic and get this done.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time and this is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Let's end this now and both walk away with a decent amount.",Bob,4,
