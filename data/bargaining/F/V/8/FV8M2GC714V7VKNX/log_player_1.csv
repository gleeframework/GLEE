"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a good start! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the adjustment, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll get $70, which is 70% of the current value of the money.

I'll think carefully... Ah, yes! I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than going to the next round and risking getting less.
