I'm going to propose a pretty lopsided split, keeping $9,000 for myself and giving Bob $1,000.  I figure it's better to get a decent chunk of money than risk getting nothing if he rejects and makes a counter-offer.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more money,  it's better to take the $4,500 than risk getting nothing if I reject and he makes a counter-offer in the next round."
