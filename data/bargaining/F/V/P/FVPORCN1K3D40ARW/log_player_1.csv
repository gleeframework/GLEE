"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm leaving some room for negotiation, so Bob can try to propose a different split if he likes."
