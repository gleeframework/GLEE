"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't beat a fair split, can you? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a fair split!

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250 (in terms of original value)
* Bob's gain: 5000 (no change in terms of original value)

Considering the inflation effect, I think this offer is a good deal for me. I accept!
