"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a small share to ensure he accepts the offer in the first round. This way, I secure the majority of the money with minimal risk of losing any due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is offering me a significantly smaller share than I proposed in the first round.  While I'm losing nothing due to inflation, I can still reject this offer and propose my own again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm decreasing my proposed share slightly, but still offering Bob a significant portion. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, as the inflation will start to affect him more with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my initial proposal, and the inflation is starting to impact him more significantly now. I can still reject this offer and propose my own again in the next round. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm reducing my proposed share again, but I'm still offering Bob a considerable sum. With each passing round, the inflation will make it more appealing for him to accept a deal rather than risk losing more of his potential earnings."
