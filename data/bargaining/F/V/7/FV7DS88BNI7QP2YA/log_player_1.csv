"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous amount considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we have many rounds left. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll calculate my gain as 0.95 * 400000 = 380000.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, considering I had offered a 70/30 split in the first round. However, I'll consider Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm looking for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, my gain will be worth 0.95 * 700000 = 665000.

I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal than the 60/40 split Bob proposed earlier.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```"
