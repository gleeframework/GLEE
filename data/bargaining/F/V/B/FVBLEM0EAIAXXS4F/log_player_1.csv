"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 40 dollars, which is 40% of the original 100 dollars. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so the effective amount I'd get is 0.8 * 60 = 48 dollars.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd get 70 dollars, which is worth 0.8 * 70 = 56 dollars in the original currency.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
