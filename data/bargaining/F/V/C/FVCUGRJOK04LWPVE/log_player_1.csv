Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get as much of the money as possible in the first round!  Since I'm the one proposing, I'll give Bob a tiny amount hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

This is a much better deal for me than the first round, even with the inflation.  I'm getting half the money, which is a great outcome!  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the future, so I'll take what I can get."
