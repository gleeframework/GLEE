"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy. In this round, I'll gain 50% of the remaining $10,000, and Bob will also gain 50%. I'll accept this offer.
