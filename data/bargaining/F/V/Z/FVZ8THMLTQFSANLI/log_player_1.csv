"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it was even, so I'll give you a slight discount! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed by Bob's ""slight discount""!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I was hoping for a more substantial offer, considering the inflation has already taken a toll on the value of the money. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal."

Round 4

# Bob's message: You want more, I give you a little more, but not too much! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer, but I'm not entirely happy with it. I was hoping for a bit more, but I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially losing more value due to inflation. I'll take the $4,500 and hope that it's enough."
