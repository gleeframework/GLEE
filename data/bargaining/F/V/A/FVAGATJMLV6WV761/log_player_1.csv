Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly and minimize the impact of inflation.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Inflation will hurt both of us, and Bob's offer is fair considering the circumstances.  It's time to agree!"
