"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, aiming to secure a large share of the money. This is because the money devalues faster for me than for Bob, so I need to be quick to get the most I can."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's true that the money is worth less with each round, I'm still better off waiting and trying to negotiate a more favorable deal. The fact that Bob offered me such a small share in the first round shows he's willing to be stubborn, but I believe I can still secure a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this round, aiming to meet Bob halfway.  I'm still aiming for a larger share due to the faster devaluation, but I want to avoid further stalemate."
