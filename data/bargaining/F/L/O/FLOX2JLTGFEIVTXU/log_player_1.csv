"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I want to maximize my gain while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Since it's the first round, I believe I can secure a good portion of the money by offering Bob a small percentage.  I'm aiming for a 90/10 split.  This should be tempting enough for Bob, especially considering he doesn't know how the inflation affects him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is significantly better than the 10% I was offered in the previous round.  Even considering the 5% inflation, taking 500,000 is more beneficial than risking further rounds and potential further losses due to inflation."
