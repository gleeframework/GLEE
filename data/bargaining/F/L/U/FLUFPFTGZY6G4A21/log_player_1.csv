"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and the money is still worth its full value. I'm giving Bob a decent share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable. I'll take it!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
