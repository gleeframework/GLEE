"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start to our negotiation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a great start, but I'd like to balance it a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 40-60 split, as it's even more skewed towards Bob's favor than my initial offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Middle ground, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise by proposing a 70-30 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split than my initial offer, but still gives me a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a small chance to reconsider 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, especially considering the inflation is affecting me more severely. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's find a fair middle ground""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise by proposing a 55-45 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split and gives me a slightly better deal than the previous offers."
