"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this round, but I'll give you a bigger share later if we play more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me a smaller share now, even if there's a promise of a bigger share later. I'd like to keep the negotiation going and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split this round, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation and the fact that I'm still willing to play more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer. The inflation is taking a significant toll on the value of the money, and I think this split is fair considering the circumstances. I'd rather get a smaller share now and end the game than risk waiting for a better offer that may not materialize."
