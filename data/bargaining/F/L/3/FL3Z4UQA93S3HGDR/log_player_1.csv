I'm going to offer Bob a smaller share, as I'm aware of the inflation and want to secure a larger portion for myself.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than mine was. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm still better off rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round.  I'll aim for a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I know the money is worth less due to inflation. I'm still offering Bob a fair amount, hoping he'll accept it to avoid further risk of losing even more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is worse than my previous ones in terms of the original value, inflation has hit both of us hard.  The money is now worth significantly less, and accepting this offer means securing a decent portion before the inflation eats away at the remaining value even further.  It's time to be practical and take what I can get."
