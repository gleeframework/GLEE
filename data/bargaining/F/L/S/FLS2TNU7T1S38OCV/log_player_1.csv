I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a very small share in the first round. It's a gamble, but I figure with the inflation factor, I can try to get most of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take $1000, I believe I can do better in the long run. The inflation factor is working against me, but I'm confident I can negotiate a more favorable deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the money this time. It's a significant increase from the first round, but still leaves me with the majority. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it.  The inflation factor is starting to weigh on me, so I want to close this deal as soon as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal. This offer is basically the inverse of what I offered in round 3, and I believe that I can secure a more equitable split. I'll continue to negotiate, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money this time. This is a significant increase from my previous offers and brings us closer to a more equal split. The inflation is hitting hard, and I need to close this deal quickly, but I still believe I can secure a good portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While the inflation is making the money worth less, I'm still holding out for a better deal. This offer is similar to the one I made in the previous round, and I believe I can get a more favorable split if I continue to negotiate. The pressure is on, but I'm determined to secure a larger portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This offer is a big concession on my part, but with the inflation hitting so hard, I need to close this deal soon. I'm offering Bob 30% of the money, which is still a significant share, but leaves me with the majority. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
