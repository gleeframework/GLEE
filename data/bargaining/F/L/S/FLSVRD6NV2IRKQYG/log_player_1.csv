"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can end the game before the money loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Accept this fair offer and let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! 

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than before, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me even less than what I had initially proposed. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better next time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and we can wrap this up!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and ending the game before the money loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not giving in yet! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting hard!

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to wait any longer and risk losing even more value. I'll have to accept Bob's offer and hope it's the best I can get.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
