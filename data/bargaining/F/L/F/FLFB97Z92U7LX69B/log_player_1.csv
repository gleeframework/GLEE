"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of the money. However, I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a bigger share this time around.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but still a decent compromise""}

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly smaller share and still being fair. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive!

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of the money. However, I'm not thrilled about Bob taking an even bigger share this time around.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
