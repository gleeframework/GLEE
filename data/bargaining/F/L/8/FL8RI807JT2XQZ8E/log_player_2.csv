Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't like my first offer, let's try to meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take it.  Inflation is a real concern, and getting something is better than risking nothing."
