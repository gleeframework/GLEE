I'm going to propose a very lopsided deal in my favor.  While I'm aware that Bob might reject this, it's my best chance to get the most money.   Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I don't like getting such a small share, it's still better than nothing.  If I reject this offer, I risk getting even less in the next round, as Bob will be able to keep even more of the money."
