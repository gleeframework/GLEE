"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This gives me a good starting point, and allows for some room to negotiate in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Although I would have preferred a larger share, the money is worth less now due to inflation. It's better to accept this offer and secure a gain, rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
