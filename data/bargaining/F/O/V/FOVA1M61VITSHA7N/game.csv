55.0,45.0,"Let's start fair. I propose we split it 55/45, with me getting the bigger share.  What do you think?",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,I rejected your last offer because I think we can find a better deal for both of us. Let's split it evenly this time.  It's a fair compromise and we can both benefit from the remaining value.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
20.0,80.0,"You're trying to be fair, but I'm not buying it. I think I deserve more than 20% of the remaining value. This is my best and final offer... for now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
40.0,60.0,"We're both losing value with each round.  I think we can still reach a deal where we both get a decent share. I'm willing to take a smaller piece this time, but I need to see some compromise from you as well. Let's split it 40/60.  It's a better outcome than our current trajectory.",Alice,5,
