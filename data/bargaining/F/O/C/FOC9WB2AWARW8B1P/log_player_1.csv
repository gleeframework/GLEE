"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the majority, huh? That's a bold move!

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a big chunk, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not budging, take what's left 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard! The money is worth a lot less now.

Bob's offer is still quite one-sided, but I need to think about the diminishing returns. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I'll be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round.
