"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the numbers are now:

* Alice's gain: $6,000
* Bob's gain: $4,000

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I think I deserve a bit more, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. Let's accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
