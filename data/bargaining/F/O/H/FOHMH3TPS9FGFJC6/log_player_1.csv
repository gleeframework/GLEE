"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's split it evenly!""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A small advantage for me, but still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since my money is worth 20% less this round, I'll think about the value of the offer in terms of the original $100. In that case, I'd be getting $20, which is 20% of the original $100.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up that much, but I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to get a better deal""}

I'm proposing that I get $40 and Bob gets $60. I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer to get a better deal, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get more 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my money!

Considering the value of the offer in terms of the original $100, I'd be getting $10, which is a very small percentage of the original amount. I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll think about it...

Since Bob is willing to take a bigger risk to get more, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly better for me. I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""A compromise to get a better deal""}

I'm proposing that I get $30 and Bob gets $70. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's slightly more favorable to me, while still being reasonable."
