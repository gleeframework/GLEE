This is a classic ultimatum game! I'm going to try to get the majority of the money, but I'm not being greedy. I'm offering Bob a fair amount.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than mine, and I don't want to risk losing even more money due to inflation.  It's time to be realistic and take what I can get."
