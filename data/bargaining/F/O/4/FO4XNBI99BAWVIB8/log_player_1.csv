"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him than my original offer, but I'm not willing to give up more than 45% of the total amount.
