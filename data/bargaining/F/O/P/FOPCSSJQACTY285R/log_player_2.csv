Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, Alice is still benefiting significantly more than Bob. With the increasing inflation, it's becoming crucial to secure a deal soon, but not at the cost of a significantly disadvantaged outcome. Bob should counter with a stronger offer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer: a perfectly even split.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point, and inflation is significantly eroding the value of the money.  It's time to make a strong stand for a fair deal. A 50/50 split is the most equitable outcome, and emphasizing the shrinking pot due to inflation might push Alice to accept."
