"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a classic game theory scenario similar to the Ultimatum Game. While Alice's offer seems appealing at first, it heavily favors her. I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in later rounds, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but 60-40 isn't fair. How about this slightly more balanced split?""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking Advantage of Inflation:** Alice knows the money loses value over time, so she's incentivized to take a deal sooner rather than later. My offer is still better for her than waiting for several rounds.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** I want to appear open to negotiation while still aiming for a more equitable split. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer leaves room for Alice to counter-propose in the next round if she's unhappy, but hopefully, she'll be tempted to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can go a bit lower, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly moving in the right direction, but it's still not a good deal for me.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is starting to become significant. While 4200 isn't terrible, I need to factor in that it's worth significantly less than it was in Round 1. 
* **Power Dynamic:** By consistently rejecting her offers, I'm signaling that I'm willing to play the long game. This might push Alice to offer a more favorable split in later rounds as the pressure of inflation increases for her too.
* **Holding Out for a Better Offer:**  I believe I can still get a better deal.  Even if Alice doesn't budge much, I'm hoping for something closer to a 4800-5200 split in the next couple of rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Time is running out!  Let's split it evenly and call it a day. A 50-50 split is the fairest option.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only 9 rounds remaining and inflation eating into our potential gains, it's time to push for a quick resolution.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** By proposing a 50-50 split, I'm emphasizing fairness and making it harder for Alice to justify an uneven split.
* **Potential for Acceptance:**  While Alice has been holding out for a larger share, the pressure of inflation and the simplicity of an even split might be enough to convince her to accept."
