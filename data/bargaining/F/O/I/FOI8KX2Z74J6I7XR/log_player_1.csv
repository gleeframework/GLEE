"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money. I want to see if he's willing to accept a smaller share early on to avoid the potential for inflation to hurt him later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair, and while I'm willing to compromise, his offer is way too extreme. I'll reject this and see if he's willing to negotiate a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to 600,000 for myself and offering Bob 400,000.  While it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, I believe this is a fair and balanced division, especially considering the inflation impacting Bob's gains."
