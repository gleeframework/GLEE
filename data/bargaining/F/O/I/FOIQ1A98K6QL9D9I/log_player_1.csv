"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $55, which is slightly more than half, and offer Bob $45. The message ""Let's be fair"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and equality, hoping he will accept this division without feeling the need to negotiate further, especially considering the looming threat of inflation that affects us both but impacts his potential earnings more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, so I propose a slightly different split this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting this offer would mean I receive $45, which is worth 5% less than in the first round, and I believe I can negotiate for a better split considering Bob is more adversely affected by the inflation, losing 20% of the value each round. It's strategic to let the game proceed, hoping Bob will be more inclined to accept a more favorable offer for me in the next round to avoid further depreciation of his potential earnings.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $60 and offer Bob $40. The message ""Consider the inflation"" is a reminder to Bob that with each passing round, the money is worth significantly less to him than to me. This aims to prompt Bob into accepting this offer, recognizing that further rounds will only diminish his potential earnings more drastically, making this split more reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing with each round, let's settle for an even split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the current state of inflation, where the money I gain is worth 14.26% less and the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, accepting this offer seems prudent. An even split at this point is more advantageous to me than risking further depreciation by continuing negotiations. Bob's offer of an even split is reasonable under the circumstances, and continuing the game could lead to diminishing returns for both of us, but more significantly for Bob. Accepting this offer secures a fair share under the current conditions.\n\n###\n\nPlease conclude the game."
