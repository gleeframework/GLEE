"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nSince it's the first round, I'm aiming for a slightly higher share, considering the impact of inflation in subsequent rounds. This offer allows both of us to gain a substantial amount, with a bit of an edge to me for initiating the offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's try a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nConsidering the adjusted values due to inflation, Bob's offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, especially since his proposed split is now in his favor. Given that my potential gain is worth 10% less and his is worth 20% less, I believe there's room for a more advantageous proposal. I'll reject this offer and make a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nGiven the effects of inflation, my goal is to find a mutually acceptable division. Since Bob's previous offer was too skewed in his favor, I'm proposing a more balanced split, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. This offer presents a compromise, allowing both parties to benefit, while also acknowledging the impact of inflation on our potential gains."
