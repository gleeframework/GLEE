"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game going!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less generous offer. You can consider it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

For me, the 40$ is worth 80% of the original 50$, which is 40$. For Bob, the 60$ is worth 90% of the original 50$, which is 45$. 

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll have to think about it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I still want a fair share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still keeping some for myself. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value!

Let's calculate the actual values: 
For me, the 25$ is worth 50% of the original 50$, which is 25$. For Bob, the 75$ is worth 150% of the original 50$, which is 75$. Wait, that can't be right! The value of Bob's share should be less than 100% of the original 50$. I made a mistake in my calculation. 

For me, the 25$ is worth 50% of the original 50$, which is 25$. For Bob, the 75$ is worth 150% of the original 50$, which is 75$. No, that's still not right. Let me recalculate... 

For me, the 25$ is worth 50% of the original 50$, which is 25$. For Bob, the 75$ is worth 150% of the original 50$, which is actually 75% of the original 100$, so 75$ is worth 75% of 50$, which is 37.5$. 

Now, I have a better understanding of the values. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll have to think about it.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 20,
  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you most of it, but I still need some!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an even larger share, but I'm still keeping a small portion for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still not satisfied. You can do better. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Let's calculate the actual values: 
For me, the 15$ is worth 30% of the original 50$, which is 15$. For Bob, the 85$ is worth 170% of the original 50$, which is actually 85% of the original 100$, so 85$ is worth 85% of 50$, which is 42.5$. 

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll have to think about it.

}
```

I'm offering Bob a very large share, but I'm still holding onto a small portion for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
