"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $160,000. Bob's gain of $800,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $720,000.

Considering the offer, I think I'll reject it. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%) due to the 20% inflation, which is $128,000. Bob's gain is worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90%), but I don't know the exact amount.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A fair share for both of us. Let's end the game.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values:

My gain of $400,000 is worth 40.8% of its original value (100% - 48.8% reduction), which is $288,000.

Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 73.9% of its original value (100% - 26.1% reduction), which is $443,400.

Considering the offer, I think I'll reject it again. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, my gain is worth 38.4% of its original value (100% - 48.8% reduction, then 61.2% of 100% - 20% reduction), which is $192,000. Bob's gain is worth 73.9% of its original value (100% - 26.1% reduction), which is $443,400.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Getting close to the end. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up my last chance to get more 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values:

My gain of $500,000 is worth 50% of its original value (100% - 50% reduction), which is $250,000.

Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 59.05% of its original value (100% - 40.95% reduction), which is $295,250.

Considering the offer, I think I'll accept it. It's a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise, and it's a good opportunity to end the game.
