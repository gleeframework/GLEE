"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself. Since the money doesn't lose value for Bob, I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, especially considering the potential loss of value for me in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money closer to 50/50, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm willing to take that risk to try to get a larger share. Since Bob is willing to negotiate, I believe I can propose a more favorable division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nI'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less for me now, so I'm trying to find a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's previous offer. By offering $57 for myself and $43 for Bob, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that Bob will find acceptable. Since the value of the money is decreasing for me, I'm trying to be more aggressive in my negotiation to make up for the loss."
