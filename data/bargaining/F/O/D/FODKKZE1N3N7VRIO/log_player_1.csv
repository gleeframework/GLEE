"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a reasonable 40% of the total amount, while I'll take $600,000. The message is to convey that this is a relatively fair split, taking into account the fact that the money loses value over time due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this is a more fair split considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I've made a concession, let's settle""
}

I've reduced my share from the initial 60% to 58%, giving Bob a slightly larger share, in an attempt to find a middle ground. The message conveys that I'm willing to compromise, taking into account the inflation, and hoping to settle the deal before the money loses even more value. Let's see Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share of the remaining money, but let's reach an agreement before inflation erodes our gains further. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000

  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000,

I've made another concession, reducing my share to 56%, in the hopes that Bob will see that I'm willing to find a mutually beneficial agreement. The message acknowledges that inflation is affecting me more, but emphasizes my desire to compromise and reach a deal before the money loses even more value. Let's see Bob's response!"
