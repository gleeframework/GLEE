"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, which I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gains, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gains are worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 2, Bob offered me $40, which is less than what I initially proposed in round 1. Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This offer is slightly more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gains even more severely, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering that my gains are still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or wait for a better one.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually closer to the original 50-50 split, and the inflation has made his gains worth significantly less. I'll take a chance and accept this offer.
