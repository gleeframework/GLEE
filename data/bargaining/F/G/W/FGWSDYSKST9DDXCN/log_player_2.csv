Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle-ish, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, 50/50 isn't really 50/50 anymore. I'll give you a slightly better deal than before 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's better than what Bob might get in further rounds if she continues to propose offers just slightly better than the last. 

Here's why accepting is the most logical choice:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Every round that Bob rejects an offer, the value of the money he could potentially gain decreases. 
* **Alice's Strategy:**  Alice is clearly aware of the inflation and is using it to her advantage. She's likely to continue offering deals that are just slightly better than before, forcing Bob to accept a smaller and smaller amount.

While accepting a 43/57 split isn't ideal, holding out for a better deal in later rounds could result in Bob receiving even less in real terms."
