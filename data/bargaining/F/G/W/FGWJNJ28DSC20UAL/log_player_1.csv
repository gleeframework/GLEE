"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40, with me taking the larger share. This is a fair offer considering we both get a significant portion.  We can avoid further rounds and get our share of the money, even with the potential inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
