Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out! This is my final offer.  It's a fair split considering the inflation, and we both need to agree before the money dwindles even further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but time is running out.  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer guarantees a reasonable amount considering the significant inflation.  Waiting any longer is too risky."
