"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate later""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. It's a good starting point for us to build a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the inflation, the new values are:

* My gain: $40 * 0.9 = $36 (10% less than the original $40)
* Bob's gain: $60 * 0.8 = $48 (20% less than the original $60)

I'm not sure if a 40/60 split is the best for me, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
