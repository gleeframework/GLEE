I'm going for a greedy approach here! I'm keeping almost everything and giving Bob a tiny amount.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm unhappy with the deal, it's better than nothing! The inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me, so accepting this offer is a good strategic move."
