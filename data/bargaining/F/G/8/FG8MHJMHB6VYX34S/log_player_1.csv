"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a split that gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is not good enough, I want more! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking.

In this round, my gain of $5000 is worth 90% of the initial $8000 I could have gotten in the first round, which is $7200. So, I'm effectively getting $7200 worth of value.

However, Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 95% of the initial $2000 he could have gotten in the first round, which is $1900. So, he's effectively getting $1900 worth of value.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not getting the better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a bigger share this round to make up for it. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need to make up for the lost value. Accept this and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing a split that gives me 60% of the remaining $10,000, and Bob 40%. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'm worth more than that! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

Let's calculate the effective values:

My gain of $4500 is worth 45% of the initial $8000 I could have gotten in the first round, which is $3600. So, I'm effectively getting $3600 worth of value.

Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 55% of the initial $2000 he could have gotten in the first round, which is $1100. So, he's effectively getting $1100 worth of value.

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my previous offer, and it's a significant improvement over the initial offer. I'll accept this offer.
