"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer this time.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
