Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's compromise.  I'm willing to go down to 70/30 in my favor.  Remember, the money is worth less to you each round, so you're losing more by waiting! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair 50/50 split. Take it before the money shrinks further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm offering 60/40.  This is a good deal for both of us - we can avoid the shrinking value of the money. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
 
It's painful to see the potential winnings shrink, but Alice is unlikely to go higher. Accepting a 40/60 split now is better than risking getting even less in later rounds, or even nothing at all."
