It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal for myself, given the inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm offering a 60/40 split, considering the inflation rates. This is a good deal for both of us, as we both lose value with each passing round.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing loss due to inflation, this is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is closer to my original goal of 6000, and Alice's offer is only worth 4800 for her now due to inflation. It's better than the previous offer from Alice and the likely outcome of further rounds."
