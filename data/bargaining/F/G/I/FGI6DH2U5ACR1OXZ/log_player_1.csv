"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent amount while still leaving me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose we split the money evenly. Since Bob rejected my previous offer and the money is losing value with each round, I think this is the fairest solution to ensure we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since the money is losing value quickly, we need to start compromising to make sure we both get something.  This offer gives Bob a good chunk of money, while still leaving me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is very unfair, and the money is quickly losing value.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm willing to accept a 40/60 split in favor of Bob. Given how quickly the money is losing value, I think it's essential that we reach an agreement soon. This offer gives Bob a significant amount, while still giving me some return on the initial investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is still unfair. Bob is becoming increasingly greedy, and the money is depreciating rapidly. I'm going to keep trying to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

I'm proposing a 30/70 split in favor of Bob. This is a significant concession, but given the rapid inflation and the risk of getting nothing, I think it's the best way to secure at least some money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is extremely unfair. I will not accept such a small amount, especially given the rapid inflation. It's better to try and negotiate further, as there's still a chance to reach a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to accept a 20/80 split in favor of Bob.  With only two rounds left, we need to reach an agreement to ensure we both get something.  This offer gives Bob the majority, but it also ensures that I receive some money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is completely unfair.  I will not accept such a small amount of money.  Even with the risk of getting nothing, it is better to stand my ground and hope for a better outcome in the future.  Bob is being incredibly greedy and doesn't seem to care about fairness."
