"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I take most of the money but you get a decent starting amount.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take something, Bob needs to consider the long game.  He has 12 rounds, and the money's value is decreasing. Holding out for a better deal could pay off in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I'm offering you a fair share, and we can avoid the shrinking value of the money.  What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than that.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Bob is still in a strong position.  While Alice's offer is more appealing than her first one, the inflation is working against Bob.  He should continue to hold out for a better deal, aiming for at least a 40/60 split to offset the inflation loss."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to budge a bit, but I need a better deal to compensate for the inflation. Let's split this 40/60 and call it a day.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit worried about the inflation.  Let's settle this now, or we risk losing more money.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice is starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds, Bob can't afford to accept such a low offer.  The inflation is severe, and his share is getting smaller with each round. He needs to hold out for a better deal. Even if the deal falls through, the potential loss from accepting such a small share is too risky."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need a fair split to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer.""
