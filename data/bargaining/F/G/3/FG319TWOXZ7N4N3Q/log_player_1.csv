"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```
This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd rather wait for a better offer. I'll reject this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
I'm offering Bob a slightly lower amount than in the first round, but still a bit more than 50% to try to get a better deal."
