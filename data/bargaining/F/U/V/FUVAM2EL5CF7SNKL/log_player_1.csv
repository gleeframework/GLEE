"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob. I think this is a fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it evenly this time. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","No, I don't think so! Since the money is worth 5% less now, I think I deserve a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
