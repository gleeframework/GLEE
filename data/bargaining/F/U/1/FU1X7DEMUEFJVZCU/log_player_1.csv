"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'd rather get a larger share while I still can.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, I'm taking 70% of the pie""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too aggressive, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me. Considering the inflation, the money is worth significantly less now, and I'd rather get a larger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll try to make an even more aggressive offer to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'm taking 80% of the pie""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. While it's a slightly better deal than before, the inflation has really taken a toll on the value of the money. I'd rather get a larger share while I still can.

However, I also don't want to risk Bob making an even worse offer in the next round. Considering the current offer, I'll take it.
