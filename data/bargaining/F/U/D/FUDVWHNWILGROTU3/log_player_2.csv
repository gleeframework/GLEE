"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to secure a larger share sooner due to the higher inflation rate you face. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 40/60 split seems fair on the surface, the higher inflation rate I face makes this offer less appealing in the long run. I'd prefer to negotiate a better split to account for the diminishing value of my portion."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a slightly better split to account for the inflation I'm facing. I'm proposing 55 for me and 45 for you. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation puts you in a tough spot, but I need a reasonable deal too.  This offer is a compromise, recognizing the value diminishes quickly for both of us as we delay. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I appreciate Alice's acknowledgment of the inflation, the proposed split is still too unfavorable to me.  The 38/62 split doesn't account sufficiently for the significant inflation I'm facing.  I need a better deal to make it worthwhile for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, with the inflation hitting us both, I think it's time we compromise. A 50/50 split seems the most fair and sustainable given the circumstances. Let's avoid further delays and secure a reasonable share for both of us.""}
