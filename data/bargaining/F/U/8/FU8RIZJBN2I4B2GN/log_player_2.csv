"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  This gives us both a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more balanced split, considering the money is worth less for you in the next round. Let's finish this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the fairest.  Accept this round, or it'll be even less appealing for you next time! 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is not as favorable as my previous proposal, accepting it guarantees me a gain.  If I reject, the inflation will hurt me in the next round, and Alice might offer even less. It's better to take what I can get at this point."
