"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping the majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. I'd like to propose a new offer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the offer again. The gap between our gains is still too large, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a 65% share of the total. I'd like to propose another offer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
