"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor will impact us both differently. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me, considering the inflation. I'm not willing to accept such a large loss in value.  I'll counter with a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

Given the inflation and the fact that Bob's last offer was unfavorable, I propose an even 50/50 split. This is a fair compromise and avoids further losses due to inflation."
