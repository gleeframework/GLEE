"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the total amount, $8,000, and Bob receives 20%, $2,000. I'm framing it as a generous offer, but also one that I think is fair given my proposed split."
