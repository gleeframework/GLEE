Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. This back and forth helps neither of us. I'm willing to compromise for a 52.5/47.5 split, but we need to decide now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000
