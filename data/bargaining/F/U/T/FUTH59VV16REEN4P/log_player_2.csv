"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  I believe this split reflects the urgency for us both to secure a deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm not convinced this is the most ""reasonable"" offer given the potential for inflation to hurt Alice more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, given the potential for inflation to impact us both differently. Let's make a deal before we lose too much.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my last offer was already generous considering the inflation.  Let's meet in the middle so we can both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is better than my last offer, and the inflation is starting to become a real risk. It's time to secure a deal."
