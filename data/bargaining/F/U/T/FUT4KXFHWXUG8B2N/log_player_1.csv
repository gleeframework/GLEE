Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me the lion's share, but leaves Bob with something. I'm hoping he'll take it to avoid risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me half the money, and with the inflation factor, my share is likely to decrease with each passing round. It's a safer bet than risking getting nothing at all."
