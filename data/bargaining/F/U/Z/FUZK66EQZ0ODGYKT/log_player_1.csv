"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I think it's fair considering I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair that Bob is proposing a 60/40 split in his favor, especially since I'm the one who made the initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want a more balanced split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a fair split. This way, we both get a decent amount.""}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is still a bit more in my favor, but I'm trying to be reasonable and give Bob a slightly larger share than his initial offer."
