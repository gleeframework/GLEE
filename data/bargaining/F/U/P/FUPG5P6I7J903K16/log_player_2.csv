"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early to accept. Let's see what Alice will offer next round, after the inflation hits."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this round. I'll take 600k, and you get 400k.  Consider this a fair split after the inflation hit us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. Meet me in the middle this time. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred my initial offer, the inflation has significantly affected the value of the money. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split after accounting for inflation, and it's better to take it than risk losing even more in the next round."
