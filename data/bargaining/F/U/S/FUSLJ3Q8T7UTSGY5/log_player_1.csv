"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This is a pretty generous offer, considering the game is just starting and the money hasn't been reduced by inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is already starting to lose value. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the offer is 50/50, I'll accept it for now.
