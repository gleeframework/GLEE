Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd love to get more, I'm not sure if Bob will offer me a better deal in the next round.  This is a decent split, and I don't want to risk getting less!"
