"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! 90% for me, 10% for you. Let's get this over with!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to start, hoping to set the tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly, considering the decreasing value of the currency. This way, we both benefit equally. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is proposing an even split! Given the decreasing value of the currency, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
