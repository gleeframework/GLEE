"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are now:

My gain would be $6,000 (20% less than $8,000), and Bob's gain would be $3,600 (10% less than $4,000).

I'm not too thrilled about the revised offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain would be worth even less in the next round, so I'd like to make a stronger offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the majority of the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting $7,000 and Bob getting $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I want, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll give you another chance to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are now:

My gain would be $5,000 (48.8% less than $8,000), and Bob's gain would be $3,650 (27.1% less than $5,000).

I'm not thrilled about the fact that Bob is now getting a 1:1 split, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can end the game here."
