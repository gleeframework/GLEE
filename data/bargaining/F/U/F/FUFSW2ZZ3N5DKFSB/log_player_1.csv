"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a higher share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value.

I'll accept this offer.
