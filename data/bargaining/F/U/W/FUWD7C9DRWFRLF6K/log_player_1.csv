"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, knowing that the money will be worth less to me in the next round. This is a strategy to secure a quick deal and avoid the risk of the money depreciating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the money I receive is worth 20% less due to inflation, accepting this offer is still the best strategy. If I reject, I will have to make an offer in the next round, and my money will be worth another 20% less.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
