"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting $7,000 and Bob getting $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of negotiating with you! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less now, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you deserve more for taking the risk? I'm not convinced!""
}
```

It's my turn to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is closer to the original 50-50 split, but still slightly in my favor due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not giving up my advantage yet! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
