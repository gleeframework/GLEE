"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but still leave you with a decent amount.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get something.  It's also the simplest solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 50/50 split is the best solution, especially since I'm already getting less value due to inflation. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve the majority. You'll get a decent amount, but I'll take the lead.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I think a more balanced split is necessary. Let's aim for a 60/40 split in my favor.  This ensures we both get a significant share, especially as the money loses value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy about the 60/40 split in favor of Bob, and I think I can do better. The money is losing value rapidly, and I need to prioritize my own gain. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. A 55/45 split in my favor seems fair, considering the inflation we're facing. This would allow both of us to maximize our gains in the remaining rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise, considering the rapid inflation we're facing. A 55/45 split in his favor is still a decent share for me, and I think it's a good idea to meet in the middle and maximize our gains in the remaining rounds. I'll accept this offer."
