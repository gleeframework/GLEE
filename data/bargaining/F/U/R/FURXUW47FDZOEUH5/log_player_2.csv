"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but still leave you with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth holding out for a better deal. The inflation will hurt Alice more than me, and I can likely secure a larger share in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both get something.  It's also the simplest solution.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve the majority. You'll get a decent amount, but I'll take the lead. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too far from my desired outcome, even with the inflation. I'm willing to wait and see if I can get a more favorable deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to negotiate, but I think a more balanced split is necessary. Let's aim for a 60/40 split in my favor.  This ensures we both get a significant share, especially as the money loses value with each round.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up the majority. You'll get a decent amount, and I'll take the lead. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too far from my desired outcome, even with the inflation. I'm willing to wait and see if I can get a more favorable deal in the next rounds.  I'm starting to think a 50/50 split might be the best we can hope for, but I'll keep pushing for a bit more."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. A 55/45 split in my favor seems fair, considering the inflation we're facing. This would allow both of us to maximize our gains in the remaining rounds.""}
