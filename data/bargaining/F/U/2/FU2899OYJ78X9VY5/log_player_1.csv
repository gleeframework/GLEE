"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, my share of 4000 is actually 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44. 

I'll reject this offer, hoping for a better deal in the next round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less in each of the two previous rounds), my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, considering the cumulative inflation:

Initial value: $10,000
Round 1: 10% loss = $9,000
Round 2: 10% loss = $8,100
Round 3: 10% loss = $7,290
Round 4: 17.1% loss (10% + 7.1% from previous rounds) = $6,025.29

So, Bob's offer of 4500 is equivalent to approximately $4,142.86 in the original value.

I'll reject this offer, hoping for a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 37.1% less than in the first round (27.1% less in the previous round, plus the additional 10% loss), my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000
}
```

I'm proposing a 20-80 split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
