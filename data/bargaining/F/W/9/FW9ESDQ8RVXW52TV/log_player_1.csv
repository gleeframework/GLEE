Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be practical - I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  This reflects the fact that inflation hits you harder than me.  Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
