Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be practical - I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  This reflects the fact that inflation hits you harder than me.  Let's settle this now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too far in your favor. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45 and end this. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
