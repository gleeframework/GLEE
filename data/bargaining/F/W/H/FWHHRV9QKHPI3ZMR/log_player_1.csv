Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, you should be motivated to end this sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's call it even. 600k for me, 400k for you.  We both get a decent amount, and we can stop this inflation game.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Seriously, Alice, every round you wait is just burning your money away. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's better to take the 250,000 now than risk getting even less in the next round.  Inflation is hurting my potential gains too much."
