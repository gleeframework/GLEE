60.0,40.0,Let's make a deal! I propose I take $60 and you take $40.  It's a good offer for you to accept now since the money will be worth less as time goes on.,Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, it's important we find a solution quickly, but it needs to be fair.  I'm proposing 60 for me and 40 for you. This reflects that the value decreases for me each round, while remaining constant for you.",Bob,4,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, we need to settle this now.  I'm taking a hit with the decreasing value, so I need you to be reasonable.  65 for me, 35 for you.  This is my final offer.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
