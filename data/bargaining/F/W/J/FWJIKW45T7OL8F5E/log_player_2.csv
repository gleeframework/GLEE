"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering I'm taking the risk of being the first to propose. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very unfair offer. Even though Alice is taking the risk of proposing first, 9000 to 1000 is a huge disparity. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
