Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 500000

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, Bob's offer is now the best option for Alice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer Alice waits, the less her share is worth due to the 5% inflation. Bob's share is decreasing even faster (20%), making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer more in future rounds. He might get desperate and offer even less, putting Alice in a worse position.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Getting money now is generally better than getting it later. Even if Alice could potentially get a bit more by dragging it out, the value lost to inflation makes accepting now a safer bet."
