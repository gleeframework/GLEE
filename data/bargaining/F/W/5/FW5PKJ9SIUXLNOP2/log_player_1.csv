"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get something rather than risking going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still relatively close to equal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
