"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1. I'll get the majority, but it's a fair start.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A more balanced split, considering the initial offer was quite skewed 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 5% less than my initial gain of $8000, so it's a bit of a decrease.

However, Bob's offer seems more balanced, and I'm willing to compromise. I think this is a fairer split.

I accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
