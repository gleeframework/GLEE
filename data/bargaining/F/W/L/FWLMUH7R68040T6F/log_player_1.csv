"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. I've included a message saying ""Let's be reasonable"" to convey that I'm open to negotiation but believe this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we need to account for. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe the split is still too much in Bob's favor. I'm willing to make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more balanced division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer an even split of $500,000 for both of us. Considering the inflation, this seems like a reasonable compromise. My message ""Meet me in the middle"" conveys my willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution."
