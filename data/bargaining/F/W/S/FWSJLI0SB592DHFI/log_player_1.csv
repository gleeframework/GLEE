"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, but I want to leave room for negotiation in case Bob wants to play it safe and accept.  Since it's the first round, there's no inflation to worry about yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While I'm taking a hit from the inflation, I'm still in a strong position.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is a fair deal, considering the inflation and the fact that I know Bob is likely feeling the pressure to get something.  If he rejects this, I'm confident I can still get a decent deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but with the inflation really starting to bite, I'm going to accept this offer.  While I'm getting significantly less than I initially hoped for, it's better than risking getting an even worse deal in the next round.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
