"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This way, I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'd rather take the original amount I proposed in the first round. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to improve my chances this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

This way, I get a slightly larger share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 512500 
# Bob gain: 487500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the money:

Alice's gain in Round 4 is worth the same as in Round 1, which is 600,000 dollars.
Bob's gain in Round 4 is worth 1,000,000 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 * 0.85 = 486,406.25 dollars.

Since Bob's offer is very close to the actual value of the money, I'll accept it. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
