Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her potential winnings decreases. While her offers are getting closer to a more even split, I believe I can still secure a better deal by continuing to reject and proposing slightly better offers for myself in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time to be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I believe I could push for a slightly higher gain, offering a 50/50 split at this stage has several benefits:

* **Fairness:** It eliminates any potential argument of unfairness and could make Alice more likely to accept.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing increases significantly with each rejection.
* **Inflation:** While my money's value remains the same, Alice's continues to decrease. A 50/50 split now is better for her than a potentially worse offer later."
