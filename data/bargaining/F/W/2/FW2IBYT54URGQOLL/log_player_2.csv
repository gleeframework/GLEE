Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's aim for a split that's more equitable for both of us. This offer is a step in that direction. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant for Bob. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, consider these points:

* **Inflation Impact:** Bob is losing value quickly. Waiting longer means getting even less in real terms.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems firm on getting a larger share. It's unlikely she'll agree to anything significantly better for Bob. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a decent sum, even if it's not the absolute maximum possible. 

Waiting any longer is a risky gamble that Alice might offer even less favorable terms in subsequent rounds.
