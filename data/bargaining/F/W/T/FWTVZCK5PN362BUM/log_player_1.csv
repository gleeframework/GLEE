"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd like to try to get a bit more to compensate for the loss in value. However, Bob's offer is a significant one, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% in the first round and another 20% in the second round), I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

This way, I'm trying to account for the reduced value of the money and still aim for a fair split. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is still a bit more in his favor, but I'm not sure if I should hold out for more.

I'll think about it for a moment...
