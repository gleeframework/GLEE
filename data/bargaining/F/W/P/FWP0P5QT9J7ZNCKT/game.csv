6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start the game, Bob! I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair offer considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation on your share.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a 55/45 split is a fairer starting point. It acknowledges the inflation but also gives me a chance to gain something from this deal. Let's start with this and see where we go.,Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against you. I'm proposing 58/42. It's a slight improvement on my initial offer, and it's the best you'll get considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. Inflation is hurting us both.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money at this point. It's a win-win for both of us. Let's not waste more time and accept this offer.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but 50/50 is not acceptable at this stage. I'm proposing 55/45.  It's a fair offer considering the lost time and the increasingly unfavorable conditions for you.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a 48/52 split.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation and the time we've already spent. Let's end this game and get something for ourselves.",Bob,6,
