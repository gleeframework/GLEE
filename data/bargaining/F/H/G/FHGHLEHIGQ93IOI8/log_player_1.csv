"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56
Bob gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56

I'll reject this offer since it's not significantly different from the previous one, and I'd like to try to get a better deal. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This way, I get 55% and Bob gets 45%."
