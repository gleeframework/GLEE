"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
