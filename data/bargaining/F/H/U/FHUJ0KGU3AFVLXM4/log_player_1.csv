"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to our negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 40$ in terms of real value.

I think Bob's offer is a reasonable one, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
