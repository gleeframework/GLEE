"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the $100 with a 75:25 ratio, favoring you slightly due to the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While this is a good offer for me now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since my money loses value faster, it makes sense to push for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I propose an even split of $50 each.  This way, we both benefit from the fairest possible deal.""}
