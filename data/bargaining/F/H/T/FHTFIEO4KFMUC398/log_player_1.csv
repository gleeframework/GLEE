Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing to keep 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  It's a good starting point, and I think it's fair given the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more, this is a reasonable offer. I'm not sure how the inflation is affecting Bob, but it seems he is willing to split the money evenly. It's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting less in the next round."
