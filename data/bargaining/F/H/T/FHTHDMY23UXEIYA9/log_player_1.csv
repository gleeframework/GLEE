```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, considering we don't know what the future rounds will bring."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so my share of $6,000 is now worth $5,400.

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. I'm still hoping to get a larger share.
