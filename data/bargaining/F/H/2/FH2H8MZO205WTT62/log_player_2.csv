Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is your last chance! 62% for me, and we're done.

# Alice gain: 620000

``` 

This is a tough one, but mathematically, it's likely the best offer I'll get at this point.  The value is dropping rapidly, and it's better to secure something than risk getting even less next round.
