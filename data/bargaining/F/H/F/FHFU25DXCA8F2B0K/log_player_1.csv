"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
 I propose to take 90$ and give Bob 10$.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the inflation rates.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
 I reject this offer.  While I'm losing value on my money, I'm also gaining more leverage with each round that passes since Bob is losing more value on his money than I am. I can probably get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}
```

I'm going to try and push for a larger share in this round.  I'm offering Bob 28 dollars, but since his money is worth 10% less than last round, this is equivalent to 31 dollars in round 2 terms.  I'm taking 72, which is equivalent to 60 dollars in round 2 terms.  This seems like a fair deal given the inflation rate and my increased leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 28 
# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  Even though the inflation is hitting me harder, my ability to negotiate is starting to diminish because Bob is losing value even faster than I am. Taking the $28 is the best I can do at this point."
