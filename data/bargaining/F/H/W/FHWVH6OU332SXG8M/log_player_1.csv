Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very uneven split, hoping to secure most of the money. Since we have 12 rounds, I figure there's room for Bob to negotiate in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better deal later on. The inflation is working in my favor, and I'm sure Bob will be more open to negotiation as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still trying to secure a majority of the money.  I'm reducing my offer slightly from the first round, but I believe Bob will be more willing to negotiate as the rounds progress and the money becomes less valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  Even though the inflation is hitting Bob harder, I believe I can still get a better deal.  My gains are significantly diminished, but I'm willing to hold out for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm reducing my offer again to try and find a middle ground. The inflation is impacting me more now, but I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise with fewer rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting the offer. While the inflation is significantly impacting both of us, I'm hoping to secure a more even split. I believe that Bob will be more open to negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

With fewer rounds left, I'm adjusting my offer to be more balanced. While I still aim for a larger share, I'm acknowledging the increasing impact of inflation and Bob's potential desperation. This might be my last chance to secure a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only a few rounds left and the inflation hitting us both hard, I'm accepting this offer.  A 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
