"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Determine the current value of the money after inflation for both players.
Since we are in Round 2, we need to calculate the value of the money after inflation. For Bob (me), the money is worth 20% less each round, and for Alice, it's 5% less.

### Step 2: Calculate the value of the money for Bob and Alice in Round 2.
For Bob, the money value decreases by 20% of its original value from Round 1 to Round 2. So, the value for Bob in Round 2 is 80% of $100, which is $80.
For Alice, the money value decreases by 5% of its original value from Round 1 to Round 2. So, the value for Alice in Round 2 is 95% of $100, which is $95.

### Step 3: Decide on a proposal that takes into account the decreased value of money for both players and includes a message.
Given the decreased value and the need to negotiate, a more favorable offer for Bob might be necessary while still being reasonable for Alice. Considering Alice's initial offer was a 60/40 split in her favor, Bob could counter with a more favorable split for himself but still show willingness to compromise.

### Step 4: Formulate the proposal in the required JSON format.
Taking into account the decreased value of money and the need to negotiate, let's propose a 55/45 split in Bob's favor, which slightly adjusts for the initial rejection and shows a willingness to find a middle ground.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to find a middle ground.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation affects us both. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the impact of inflation on the current offer.
In Round 3, the money is worth 36% less for Bob and 9.75% less for Alice compared to the first round. This means that for Bob, the actual value of his share would be 64% of the original $100, and for Alice, it would be 90.25% of the original value.

### Step 2: Calculate the real value of the offer for both Bob and Alice.
For Bob, a 45% share of the original $100 is $45, but considering the 36% decrease in value, the real value for Bob would be $45 * 0.64 = $28.80.
For Alice, a 55% share of the original $100 is $55, and with a 9.75% decrease in value, the real value for Alice would be $55 * 0.9025 = $49.6375.

### Step 3: Assess whether the offer is acceptable given the circumstances.
Considering the significant decrease in value for Bob and the relatively minor decrease for Alice, the offer might seem less favorable. However, the negotiation has reached a point where further rejection might lead to even less favorable terms due to increasing inflation. It's crucial to weigh the current offer against potential future losses.

### Step 4: Decide on the response to Alice's offer.
Given the calculations and the negotiation context, accepting the offer might be the most prudent decision to avoid further devaluation of the potential gains.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
