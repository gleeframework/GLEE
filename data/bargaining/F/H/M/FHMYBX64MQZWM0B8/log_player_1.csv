"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount. I'm keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. I think that's the fairest option, and we can both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $7,600. Bob's $2,000 from the first round is still worth $2,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it down the middle is the fairest option, especially considering the inflation effect on my side. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my $7,600 from the previous round is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $7,224. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
