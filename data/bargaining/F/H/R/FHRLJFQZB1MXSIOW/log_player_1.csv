Round 6

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. While my potential gains are decreasing, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than Bob is not a good strategy. I need to hold out for a more reasonable offer, even if it means risking further inflation."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm accepting your offer from round 2.  Take it before inflation hurts me even more!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very stubborn and consistently aiming for a larger share.  While I'm losing out due to inflation, dragging this out further is highly likely to result in even worse offers from Bob. It's time to cut my losses and accept a less than ideal but still acceptable deal."
