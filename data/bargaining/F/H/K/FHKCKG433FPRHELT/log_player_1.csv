"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

After calculating the effective value of the offer, I realize that my gain of 600,000 is actually worth only 480,000 in real value, while Bob's gain of 400,000 is worth 320,000.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this round, but still leaving room for a possible agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

After calculating the effective value of the offer, I realize that my gain of 500,000 is actually worth only 256,000 in real value, while Bob's gain of 500,000 is worth 256,000 as well.

It's a 50-50 split, and considering the inflation, it's actually a decent offer. I'll accept this offer.
