Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  I figure he'll be more likely to take something now than risk getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing later. The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to gamble with what's left."
