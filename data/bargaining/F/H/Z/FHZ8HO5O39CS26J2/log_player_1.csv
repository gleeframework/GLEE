Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is a fair offer considering the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently aiming for a 60/40 split in his favor. While time pressure is a factor, accepting this offer at Round 4 would mean settling for significantly less due to inflation. It's riskier, but I need to push for a better deal."
