"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair share?""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a fairly even split, slightly in my favor. Since the money loses value for me with each round, I'm motivated to end the game quickly. This offer tests Bob's willingness to accept a reasonable division early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer is better for both of us in the long run. Let's settle and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer might seem reasonable at first glance, considering the inflation that affects my share, accepting this offer would mean I'm actually getting less value compared to if we had settled in the first round. Given that the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm motivated to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round, hoping Bob might be willing to give me a larger share to end the game sooner.\n\n###\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if we can negotiate a better deal.\n\n###\n\n###\n\n###\n\nMy turn now. Here's my new proposal:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Equal split considering my loss.""}\n\nGiven the inflation, an equal split at this point would actually be slightly less advantageous for me compared to the first round, but I'm hoping the gesture of an equal split might appeal to Bob and end the game sooner, minimizing further loss in value for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Equal split considering my loss.""}\n\nAs previously calculated, considering the 20% decrease in value for me, an equal split at this point is actually a compromise on my part. I'm hoping this gesture towards fairness will be enough for Bob to accept, given that further rounds will only continue to decrease the value for me, potentially making his share larger in real value if he waits. However, the incentive for him to accept now is to secure his share before I might decide to offer less in subsequent rounds due to the decreasing value of the money for me."
