"Round 1

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""This offer is better for both of us in the long run. Let's settle and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Equal split considering my loss. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is now much closer to a fair split considering the inflation. Accepting ensures I get a reasonable share, whereas rejecting risks further losses for her, potentially leading to a worse offer in the next round."
