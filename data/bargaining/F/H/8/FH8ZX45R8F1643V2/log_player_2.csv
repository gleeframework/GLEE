"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm happy to negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better split. Since the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round, I want to try to get a good deal before the value decreases too much. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. I think 55-45 is a fair split considering the inflation rate is higher for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is impacting us both, and this seems like the fairest solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept Alice's offer this time. Since the money is worth 9.75% less to me than in the first round, and 36% less to Alice, I think an even split is a reasonable compromise. The difference in inflation rates is significant, but I don't want to risk going further and potentially getting nothing. An even split seems like a safe choice at this point."
