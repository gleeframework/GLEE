Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both walk away with something.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair to me, especially considering inflation.  I'm not going to accept such a small share, even if I'm the one proposing next. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a more even split this time, but still taking into account the impact of inflation on my side. I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer, as we both get a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse!  I refuse to accept such a small share, especially with the increasing impact of inflation. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a 50/50 split, acknowledging the inflation impacting my share but hoping Bob sees the value in a fair outcome for both of us.  It's the best I can offer without risking even less in the next round."
