"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good one. Think about it! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to consider the offer carefully.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, my gain of $40 is actually worth $32 (80% of $40).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll think about it... 

After considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Consider this offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the remaining $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. Don't pass it up! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the money I would gain in this offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $45 is actually worth $23.64 (52.2% of $45).

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, I'll think about it... 

After considering the offer, I'll decide to accept it.
