"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split close to 50/50, but slightly in my favor considering the inflation impacting me more. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5238,
""alice_gain"": 4762,
""message"": ""My turn. Inflation makes this tough, let's be fair to both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding Inflation:** It's crucial to recognize that delaying benefits me less than Alice. Each round, the value of my potential earnings decreases. 
* **Fairness and Urgency:** My offer is still close to a 50/50 split, but slightly favors me to offset the inflation disadvantage.  The message emphasizes fairness while subtly conveying the need for a quicker resolution in my favor.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By making a reasonable offer, I increase the pressure on Alice. If she rejects this, she risks getting a worse deal in later rounds, especially considering the inflation working against me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is starting to hurt you more, Bob. Let's be sensible and split it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer this drags on, the more I lose due to inflation. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking a worse offer from Alice later, where my potential gain will be even further eroded.
* **Strategic Retreat:**  Alice knows I'm feeling the pressure of inflation. Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of getting a significantly worse one in a later round. 
* **Certainty vs. Gamble:** Accepting now secures me a reasonable sum. Rejecting keeps the game going with no guarantee of a better outcome for me, and a very real possibility of a worse one."
