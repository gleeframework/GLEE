Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping to secure the money quickly before inflation eats away at my share.  Let's see if Bob is happy with this deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less generous, but it's still worth considering. However, I'm going to gamble and reject it. Inflation is hurting me more than Bob, so I have more incentive to push for a better deal. Hopefully, I can convince him to give me more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than his previous offer.  Since inflation is hurting me more, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal, but I'm still willing to compromise.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is seriously eating into my potential gains now, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's better than continuing to risk losing more due to inflation.  I'm accepting it."
