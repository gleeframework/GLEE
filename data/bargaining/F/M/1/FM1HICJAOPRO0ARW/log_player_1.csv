# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50$ is worth even less than before. I'll try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll aim for a larger share.

  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"

Round 4

# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! With my gain worth 27.1% less, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still relatively close to equal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.
