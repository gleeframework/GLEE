"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25:75, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 31.6 
# Alice gain: 68.4 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 31.6 is actually a better deal than the 30 I offered in round 2. I'll accept Alice's offer this time.
