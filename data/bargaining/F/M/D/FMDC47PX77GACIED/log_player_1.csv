I'm rejecting this offer.  It's getting closer, but the rate of inflation means I need to hold out for a bit more to make up for the shrinking pot on my end."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking to a fair split.  It's the most rational choice for both of us with the inflation ticking against you. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

It's painful, but I have to accept.  The rate of inflation is eating into my potential gains faster than Bob is willing to budge. An even split at this point is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
