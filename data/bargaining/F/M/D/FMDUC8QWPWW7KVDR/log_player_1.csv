"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, giving me a good chunk of the money while also offering Bob something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I would receive $300,000, the value has been significantly reduced by inflation. It's not a good deal compared to the initial offer I made. I believe I can still get a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a more even split this time, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. Inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the reduced value while also giving Bob a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  While the value of the money has decreased significantly, it's now better for me to accept than to risk another round and potentially get an even smaller share.  This offer ensures I still receive a substantial amount."
