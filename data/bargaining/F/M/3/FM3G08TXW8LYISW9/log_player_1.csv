"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, a 50/50 split is a very reasonable offer, and it's a significant improvement from my initial proposal. I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob seems eager to end the game quickly.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
