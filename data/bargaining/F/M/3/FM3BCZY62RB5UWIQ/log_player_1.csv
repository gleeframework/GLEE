"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000:100,000 split in my favor. This allows for a fair initial gain for Bob while securing a majority of the money for me. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation, I'm still getting 300,000. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering a 600,000:400,000 split in my favor.  This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the inflation we've both experienced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has hit me hard, I'm now only getting 48.8% of my initial offer.  I'm unlikely to get a better deal in the next round, and 400,000 is still a decent amount of money. I accept."
