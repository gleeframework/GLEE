"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a simple, straightforward split. I take the vast majority, leaving Bob with a single dollar.  This is a demonstration of my strategic thinking, and I'm curious to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still maintaining a significant advantage. Let's see if this offer is more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 999990 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  We've both rejected offers that heavily favor the other, so it seems like a fair and logical solution. It's also in our best interest to reach an agreement before we run out of rounds."
