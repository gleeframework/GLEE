"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can adjust from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm going for a strong opening 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a significant advantage for himself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty aggressive opening, Bob. I'm not willing to give you 80% of the pot just yet.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending it back to him. It's my turn again!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. But I'm not giving up too much ground just yet.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself this time, but still leaving room for negotiation."

# Bob's message: You're still too high, I'll give you a better deal if you meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to wear me down with a lower offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still too aggressive, Bob. I'm not willing to give you 70% of the pot. Meet me at 55/45 and we can talk.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending it back to him. I'm trying to find a more balanced split that works for both of us."

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Meet me at 42/58 and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but don't think you're getting away with the whole thing 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a slightly more generous offer, but still keeping the upper hand. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still too close to 60/40, Bob. I'm not willing to give you 60% of the pot. Meet me at 45/55 and we can make a deal.""
}
```

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to reduce the value of the money, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 385000,
  ""bob_gain"": 615000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. But I'm still willing to meet you at 38.5/61.5. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more favorable split for myself, but I'm getting close to the point where I'll have to accept a less-than-ideal deal."
