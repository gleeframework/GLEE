"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal quickly before inflation hits!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting a slightly uneven split to avoid losing value to inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both have the chance to make a counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give up yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can get a better deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of another round of inflation to try and get it!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 52.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 47.5,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway between our previous offers. Inflation is eating away, let's settle!""
}


I'm trying to find a middle ground between our previous offers, hoping Bob will see the sense in compromising before the value drops further!"
