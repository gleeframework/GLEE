"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a larger share, huh? I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a bit more skewed towards me, but still a reasonable offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
