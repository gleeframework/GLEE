"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. You get 10% and I get 90%.  We can adjust this as we go along. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 850000,
""alice_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic - I'm proposing I take 85%, you take 15%.  The value of this deal diminishes quickly for both of us as we progress, so I suggest accepting now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take 60%, you take 40%. This keeps the deal more equitable than your previous offer and provides a reasonable return for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aware that the inflation hurts her more than me.  While her offer is getting better, waiting her out is the stronger play. I need to signal I'm willing to play hardball to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money in this game, and we're both losing value quickly.  My offer is more than generous -  I'll take 70% and you get 30%.  Let's close this deal now and avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you more, Bob, but I need a better share than your last offer. This is a more fair split, allowing us both to get a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky decision point. While I'd prefer a higher percentage, Alice's offer is now at a point where it's worthwhile to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer this drags on, the less valuable the money becomes. Alice is feeling this pressure more strongly, but it's impacting me too.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a better deal means risking getting a worse one, or even nothing, in the later rounds. 
* **Fairness:** This offer is reasonably fair.  While I'm getting slightly less than my ideal, Alice is also making a compromise. 

It's time to take the sure win and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
