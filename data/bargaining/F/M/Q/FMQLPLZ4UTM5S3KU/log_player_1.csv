"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm actually gaining more in real terms in this round than in the first round. And Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair one.

I accept Bob's offer.
