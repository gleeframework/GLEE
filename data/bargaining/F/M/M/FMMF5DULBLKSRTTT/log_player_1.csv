"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing to take $99 and give Bob $1. This is a very aggressive strategy to start with, aiming to secure the majority of the money early on. I'm hoping that Bob will be surprised by this and accept the offer, especially since he doesn't know about the inflation effect on my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though Bob is taking a larger share, I'm accepting this offer.  The inflation effect on Bob is unknown to me, so I don't want to risk further rounds and potentially ending up with less money. Taking 60% is still a good outcome given the situation."
