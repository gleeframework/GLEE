"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate too hard!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide what to do!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk of the money! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the inflation effect.

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me $4,000, which is worth 80% of the original $5,000 I proposed, I'll have to decide whether it's worth it.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% inflation that has occurred so far.

Since the money is worth 90% of its original value, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk of the money! The clock is ticking! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite! With the money worth only 27.1% of its original value, I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled with the 48/52 split, especially since I was hoping to get a better deal earlier. However, the clock is ticking, and I don't want to risk going home with nothing.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
