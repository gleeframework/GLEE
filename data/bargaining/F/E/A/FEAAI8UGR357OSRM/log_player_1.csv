Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 7/3 is a more balanced split, considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. This way, we both have a fair chance to gain more in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
