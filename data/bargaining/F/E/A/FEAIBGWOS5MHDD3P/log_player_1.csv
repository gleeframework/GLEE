"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. With this offer, I'd get $50, which is 50% of the remaining $100. Considering the inflation, I think this is a decent offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
