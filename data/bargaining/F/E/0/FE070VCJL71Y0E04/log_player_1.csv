Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in our favor.  The value of the money is already decreasing, and we need to secure a larger share to make the most of this opportunity. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
