Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'll take 70, and you get 30. We're both aware of the inflation risk, so let's reach an agreement before things get even more complicated. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70
