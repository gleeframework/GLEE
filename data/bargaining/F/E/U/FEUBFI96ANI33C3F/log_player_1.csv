"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's end the game""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you less, you'll give me more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the offer, as I'm getting a smaller share than in the first round. I'll try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly larger share and getting a slightly larger share myself."
