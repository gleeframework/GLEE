"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total amount, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm taking a bit more this time, but we can still end this quickly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth 90% of the original amount, which is $405,000.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob taking a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
