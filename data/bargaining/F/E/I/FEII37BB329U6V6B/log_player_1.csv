"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""
}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the compromise, but I'll consider it.

{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $70, considering I was initially willing to give Bob $40. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise and give you 50/50.""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's initial offer, but still a compromise."
