"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll have to consider that.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I want to try to get a better deal, considering the reduced value of my share due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000, and I'll take the remaining $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of my share, I'll think carefully about this offer. However, since the money I gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'll have to consider the fact that Bob is still getting a larger share.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take this offer, as it's likely that the value of my share will continue to decrease with each passing round."
