"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, and I'll take $80. It's a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is worth less than $80 in the first round. I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get more money, considering the reduced value of my potential gain.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to maximize my gain while keeping Bob's share reasonable. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, and I'll take $60. This way, I'm trying to balance my gain with the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $40 is worth even less than in the previous rounds. Considering Bob's offer, I think I should accept this one. The value of my gain is lower, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns.
