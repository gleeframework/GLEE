"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 60/40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair split, considering we're starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I propose 60/40 in my favor.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer. I think he's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less now. I'll reject his offer and try to make a better one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a better split considering the inflation""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and adjust the split to account for the reduced value of the money. I think 55/45 is a fairer split than Bob's previous offer."
