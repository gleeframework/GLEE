"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is 20$. I'll take the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll calculate my gain as 60 * 0.8 = 48.

Here's my response:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
I reject Bob's offer because I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In the third round, the money is worth 40% of its original value, so I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28
}
```
I'm offering Bob 28% of the original 100$, which is 28$. I'll take the remaining 72%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 68 
# Bob gain: 32 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less in the fourth round, I'll calculate my gain as 68 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484 = 0.516, to account for the 48.8% reduction) = 35.088.

Here's my response:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I accept Bob's offer. I think it's a good deal, considering the reduced value of the money."
