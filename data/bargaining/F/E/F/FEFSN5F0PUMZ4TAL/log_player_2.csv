# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer. The inflation is affecting Alice's gain, so I have more bargaining power."

# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer. With the inflation affecting Alice's gain significantly, I have even more bargaining power now. A 50/50 split is not the best deal for me at this point."
