I propose that Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000. This is a fair starting point, considering I'm taking a slight risk by proposing first."

This game is getting frustrating!  I'm still holding out for a better deal.  The inflation is hurting, but I don't want to give up too much yet."

This is getting tense. The inflation is really starting to bite, but I'm still holding out for a fair share.  I'm offering a slightly larger portion to Bob, hoping he sees the value in taking a deal before it's too late."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4096 
# Bob gain: 5904 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While the inflation has taken a significant bite out of my potential gains, I have to accept this offer. There are only two rounds left, and the risk of getting nothing is too high. This offer at least gives me something."
