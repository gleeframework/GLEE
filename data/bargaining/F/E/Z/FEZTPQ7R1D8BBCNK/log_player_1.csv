"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a third of the money""
}
```

This way, I get 70$ and Bob gets 30$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to consider that his 50$ is worth less than my 50$. I'll accept this offer.
