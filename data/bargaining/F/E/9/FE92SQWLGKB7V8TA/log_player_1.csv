"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This way, I get 40% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 300,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 285,000. Still a good deal!

I accept the offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
