"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in later rounds if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a bit better than a 60/40 split. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm hoping we can come to a more equitable agreement in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'll try to negotiate a bit.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
