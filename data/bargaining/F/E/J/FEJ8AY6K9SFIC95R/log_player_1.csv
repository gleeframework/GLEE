"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000.  This gives me a comfortable majority of the money, while still offering Bob a decent sum.  I'm hoping he'll accept in the first round to avoid any inflation risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep a larger share, the inflation factor is significant.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I still receive a sizable amount, and avoids the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
