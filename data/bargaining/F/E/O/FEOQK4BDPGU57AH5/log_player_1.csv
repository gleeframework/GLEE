I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself and a very low offer for Bob. This is to maximize my potential gains, but also to see how he responds. We'll see if he accepts this offer or if he's willing to play the game and see if he can get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm not going to let him get away with that. I will reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer a bit, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's. I want to see if he's willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly aggressive with his offers. While the inflation is making his offers more attractive, I am still confident in my ability to negotiate a better deal for myself. I will continue to reject his offers and try to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal for myself and avoiding a stalemate where we both end up with nothing."
