"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly better split, but still a bit biased towards you 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth 20% less, my potential gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,200 in real terms. Bob's potential gain of $6,000 is actually worth $4,800 in real terms.

I'm not thrilled about the split, but it's a slightly better offer than the first one. I'll accept this offer for now.
