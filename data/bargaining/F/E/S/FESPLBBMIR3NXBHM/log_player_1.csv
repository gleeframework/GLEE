Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation is hurting me, but I'm willing to take a smaller share.  Let's avoid any further delays and split it 60/40. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is acknowledging the impact of inflation, his offer is still not advantageous for me.  I need to hold out for a better deal, knowing that the inflation is working in my favor with each passing round."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:** This offer is acceptable.  While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is finally acknowledging the significant impact of inflation. Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable gain for me before inflation further erodes his share, potentially leading to a worse offer in the next round."
