"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm offering a relatively fair split, with me taking a slight majority of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, Alice. Let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Splitting it 50/50 seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially losing more value due to inflation."
