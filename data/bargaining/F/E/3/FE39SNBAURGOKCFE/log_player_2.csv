"Round 1
Alice's offer:

This is a classic game theory scenario where patience is rewarded. While the offer isn't terrible, it's highly likely I can get a better deal by waiting. Alice's money is devaluing faster than mine, making her more likely to propose a better split in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this split is more reflective of the situation.  Let's close this out and both benefit.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to frame the situation to her advantage. While her offer has technically improved, it's still not a good deal for me.  The pace of her devaluation is accelerating, making it even more likely she'll concede a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this settled.  This offer is more than fair considering the circumstances.  Take it and we both win.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a tough call, as it's getting late in the game. However, Alice's phrasing suggests increasing desperation. While a 45/55 split isn't ideal, holding out one more round could force her to make a much larger concession. The risk is she might offer even less next time, but the potential reward of a more favorable split is worth the gamble."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  My final offer reflects the time pressure and the reality of your shrinking gains.  Let's end this now before we both lose out further.""}
```"
