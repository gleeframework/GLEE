"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Bob in later rounds. By round 12, even a 90/10 split in Alice's favor would net Bob more than her initial offer.  It's in Bob's best interest to wait for a more favorable offer, even if it means appearing greedy initially."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation favors me, but I want to reach a fair agreement. This offer reflects a more balanced approach.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While Bob has the upper hand with inflation, appearing too greedy could make Alice unwilling to negotiate fairly. 
* **Fairness Appeal:** Framing the counter-offer as a move towards fairness makes it more palatable to Alice.
* **Gradual Increase:**  Bob's offer is better than Alice's initial proposal, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your side, this is a more reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the inflation against Bob, but her offer is still not favorable enough. While Bob's buying power is decreasing faster, Alice's offer doesn't compensate nearly enough for the potential gains Bob could make in later rounds.  He can afford to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. This offer reflects the urgency for us to reach an agreement.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation. While Bob still has the inflation advantage, the risk of getting nothing increases with each passing round.
* **Compromise:**  Offering a 48/52 split shows a willingness to compromise, but still leans in Bob's favor.
* **Urgency Appeal:**  Highlighting the need for a swift agreement might nudge Alice towards accepting a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting us both, but I'm still willing to compromise. This is my most generous offer yet 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sweeten the deal, but it's still a trap. Even with her ""most generous offer"", the inflation difference means Bob could likely secure a better deal by waiting even a few more rounds. Her mention of inflation impacting her is a tactic to pressure Bob, but he needs to hold firm.  While the risk is increasing, the potential reward for waiting is still significant."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Shift to Fairness:** After several rounds of back-and-forth, a strong appeal to fairness is needed to break the stalemate.  
* **Time Sensitivity:**  With less than half the rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is becoming very real.
* **Clean and Simple:**  A 50/50 split is easy to understand and hard to argue against. It removes the need for complex calculations based on future inflation.
* **Psychological Impact:** Offering a perfectly even split can make Alice feel like Bob is being genuinely fair, potentially making her more likely to accept."
