"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the money, but it's a relatively high amount for Bob, so I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair proposal from Bob! I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split the money evenly just yet. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to my previous offer. Still a good deal for you, Bob!""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give Bob, but not by too much. I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I believe my contribution deserves a larger share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take the lead!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a larger share than me. I think 4,000 for me is too low, considering I'm the one making the offer and taking the risk of rejection. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. A slight adjustment to my previous offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but still slightly favoring myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair compromise, considering my previous offers. Let's end the game. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to wrap things up!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I think I can do better than 45% of the money. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, Bob. You're getting a good offer here.""
}
```

I'm trying to inch closer to a deal, but still keeping a slight edge for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's end this with a fair split. It's the most sensible option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Déjà vu! Bob's making the same offer as in Round 2!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept the same offer again. I think I can still do better than a 50-50 split. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal, Bob. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm making one last push for a deal. I'm giving Bob a slightly lower share, but I think it's a fair offer considering the negotiations so far."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time. Let's end this with a fair split,  or we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make one last attempt at a deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer. It's a 50-50 split, which is fair considering we're running out of time. I'd rather take the $5,000 than risk getting nothing."
