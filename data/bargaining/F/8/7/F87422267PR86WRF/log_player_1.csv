"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll try to maximize my gain while still being reasonable. In this case, I'll accept the offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
