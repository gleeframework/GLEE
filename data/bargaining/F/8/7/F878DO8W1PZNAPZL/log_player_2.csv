Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This is a better deal than your last, and time is running out for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, this offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure but still giving us both a reasonable share. It's a deal worth taking!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, especially for Alice. Waiting longer means I risk getting even less.  A 50/50 split, while not in my favor initially, is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds.
