"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'll take a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 30/70, I'll try to negotiate a better split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, 45/55, let's make a deal!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is closer to the original 50/50 split, but still takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
