"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle.  It seems like we're both willing to compromise, so a 50/50 split is the fairest way forward.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more after your previous high offer 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, the inflation is hurting my gains significantly, and it's not likely to get better if we continue. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, whereas another round might leave me with nothing at all."
