"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'm offering you 45% and keeping 55% for myself. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, accepting the offer of 45% would give Bob $45, while Alice would receive $55. Considering the game has just begun and the impact of inflation (10% decrease in value for Bob and 5% for Alice per round), it's strategic for Bob to reject the initial offer in hopes of negotiating a better deal in subsequent rounds. With 12 rounds available, Bob has ample opportunity to counteroffer and potentially gain a larger share, especially since the value of money decreases more significantly for him with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe I should get a bit more. How about 52 for me and 48 for you?""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given the inflation rates (10% decrease for Bob and 5% for Alice per round), it's logical for Bob to seek a larger share to compensate for the greater devaluation of his potential earnings over time. Offering 52% for himself and 48% for Alice is a strategic move, aiming to secure a better deal early in the game while still appearing somewhat fair, in hopes that Alice will accept before the value of the money decreases further."
