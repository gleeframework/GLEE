"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's see if we can find a better compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so my gain of 50 dollars is actually worth 45 dollars.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, as I was hoping to get more. However, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to meet me halfway, which is a good sign.

I'll decide to...

```

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 dollars is actually worth 29.2 dollars (100 * 0.2912), which is a significant reduction.

Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to get a better deal for himself. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal.
