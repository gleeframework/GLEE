Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to counter with a more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is the same as mine in round 2, but considering the inflation, the value of her offer is actually worse for her than mine was in round 2. I'll stick with my original offer from round 2, which is still a better deal for me.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer in round 3 was the same as mine in round 2, and she rejected it, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. I'll take a bigger share this time.
