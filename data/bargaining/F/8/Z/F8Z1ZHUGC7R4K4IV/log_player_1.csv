"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. It's a fair share, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in Round 2, my share of 400,000$ is now worth 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000$. And Bob's share of 600,000$ is now worth 600,000 * 0.9 = 540,000$.

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so it's worth 90% of the value in Round 2. Since the value in Round 2 was 90% of the value in Round 1, the money is now worth 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000
}
```

I'm offering you 190,000$ and keeping 810,000$ for myself. It's a fair share, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my share of 190,000$ is now worth 190,000 * 0.723 = 137,370$. And Bob's share of 810,000$ is now worth 810,000 * 0.723 = 585,369$.

I don't think this is a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 5, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so it's worth 100,000 * 0.723 = 72,300. Since the value in Round 4 was 72.3% of the value in Round 3, the money is now worth 0.723 * 0.9 = 0.6507 of its original value.

Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 465000,
  ""bob_gain"": 535000
}
```

I'm offering you 535,000$ and keeping 465,000$ for myself. It's a fair share, don't you think?"
