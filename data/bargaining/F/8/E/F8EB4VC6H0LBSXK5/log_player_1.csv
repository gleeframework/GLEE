"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to establish a baseline for our discussion.\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, although it seems fair at first glance, the inflation has already reduced the value of the money. Since we're in the second round, I think I can negotiate for a better deal, considering the decreased value of the money.\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a 58-42 split in my favor. Given the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, I believe this is a reasonable adjustment. I'm willing to give Bob a bit more than 40% to account for the loss of value, but I still want to prioritize my own gain.\n\nLet's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for inflation and is fair given we are running out of time. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (48.8% less than the initial amount), I believe Bob's offer is reasonable. The 55-45 split is closer to the fair division I initially proposed, and given the time pressure and loss of value, I think it's wise to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation.\n\nLet's finalize the deal!"
