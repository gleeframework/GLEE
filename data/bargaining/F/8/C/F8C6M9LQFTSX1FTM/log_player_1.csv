Let's start with a fair and equal split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll take my chances with a better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to try and increase my share slightly, but still offer a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a worse deal than the first round, the inflation is really starting to hurt. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee I get something at this point."
