"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. This is a pretty generous offer to start, but I want to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the value of the money Bob receives is decreasing with each round, so it's likely he won't make a better offer in the future. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and accepting this offer ensures I get something before the value of the money decreases further."
