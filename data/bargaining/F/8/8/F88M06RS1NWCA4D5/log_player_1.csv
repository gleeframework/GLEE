"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial 100$, which is 80 dollars, and leaving 20 dollars for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair split and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is now worth 40 dollars (since 50 * 0.8 = 40).

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering I've already proposed a fair split in the first round and he rejected it. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I deserve more after your rejection. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so my offer is now worth 32 dollars (since 50 * 0.64 = 32).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more after your rejection.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still offering you a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 dollars is now worth 20.8 dollars (since 40 * 0.518 = 20.72, rounded to 20.8).

Considering the value of the money has decreased significantly, I'm not sure if 20.8 dollars is a good deal. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 20.8 dollars is enough. I'll try to do better.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so my offer is now worth 10.56 dollars (since 40 * 0.264 = 10.56).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise given the circumstances.""
}
```"
