600000.0,400000.0,I propose we divide the money with a 3:2 ratio. This ensures a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I think 3:2 is too generous. This 3:1 split is a fair starting point for further negotiations.",Bob,2,
,,"Your proposal suggests a 3:1 split, which I find unfair given the diminishing value of money for both of us. I would prefer to continue negotiating for a more equitable distribution.",Alice,2,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Considering the decreasing value of money, I propose a 4:1 split. This aims for a balanced distribution while acknowledging the inflationary pressures in future rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 1:1 split. This way, we can both benefit from the remaining value of the money, and we can avoid further negotiations in the face of increasing inflation.",Bob,4,
,,I accept the 1:1 split. It's a fair compromise given the current state of inflation and the diminishing value of money in future rounds.,Alice,4,accept
