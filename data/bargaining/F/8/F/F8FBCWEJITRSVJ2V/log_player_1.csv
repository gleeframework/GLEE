"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
 I'm going to start by offering Bob a small amount. I'm hoping he'll accept in the first round to avoid any potential inflation issues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, even after taking into account the inflation. I will reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 81, ""bob_gain"": 19}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still try to keep the majority of the money. The inflation is becoming a concern, so I want to secure a deal as soon as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 19 
# Bob gain: 81 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is less than what I initially offered, the inflation is starting to hit hard. I'm going to accept this offer and avoid further risk of losing more money."
