"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my fair offer, now it's my turn to make a better one! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to get the better deal!

I'll reject this offer as well, since it's not in my favor.

It's my turn again!"
