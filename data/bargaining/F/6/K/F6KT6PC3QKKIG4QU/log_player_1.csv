"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}

I propose a 95/5 split, with me getting $950,000 and Bob getting $50,000.  Since this is the first round, I'm taking a risk with a relatively high offer, but it's important to establish a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the inflation means my gains are worth less with each round.  It's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing later."
