  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This allows us both to benefit, with a slightly larger share for me due to the decreasing value of money over rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equitable split, closer to 50/50. This acknowledges the decreasing value of money for both of us, but gives us both a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
