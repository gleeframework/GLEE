"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  That way we both get a good amount and avoid any potential for disagreements later. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain would be $6,400 ($8,000 x 0.8) if I were to accept the previous offer.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully. Splitting the money evenly might not be the best option for me, as I'd only get $5,000. However, it's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation.
