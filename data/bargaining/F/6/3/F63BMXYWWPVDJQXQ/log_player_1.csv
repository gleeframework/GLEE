"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  Since this is the first round, the inflation effect is minimal.  I'm hoping this offer will be appealing to Bob, but I'm also willing to negotiate in future rounds if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action. The inflation is starting to take its toll, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm happy to take it."
