"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 10% share, which is a relatively small amount, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 200,000 is now worth 180,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with a smaller amount. I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
