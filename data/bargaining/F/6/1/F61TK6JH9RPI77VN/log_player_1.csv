I'm starting with a very generous offer, hoping Bob will accept quickly.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal in later rounds if he rejects.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer. It's still early in the game, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal later on. I'll reject his offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, considering the inflation that has occurred. I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, but I need to be a little more realistic now.  Let's see if Bob is willing to take a smaller cut this time."
