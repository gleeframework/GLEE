I'm taking the majority share, but I'm still giving Alice a decent amount.  Let's see if she's willing to split the difference."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer isn't great, it's better than nothing. With the inflation, my share is worth significantly less than in the first round.  It's time to take what I can get."
