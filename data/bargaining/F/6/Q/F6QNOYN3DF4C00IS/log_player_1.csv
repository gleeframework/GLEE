"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%. It's a fair starting point, don't you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a bigger share of the pie. However, I'm not willing to give up that much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to balance the scales a bit. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, but I'm still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to stick to his guns, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to give him the upper hand just yet. However, I do see that his offer is slightly more favorable to me than his previous one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take this offer and call it a day."
