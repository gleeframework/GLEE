Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  It's the fairest way to start, and we can both benefit from the inflation differently in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
