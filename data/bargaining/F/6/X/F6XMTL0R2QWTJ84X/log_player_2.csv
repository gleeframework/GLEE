Let's see what Alice proposes next!  I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since I rejected her offer, I'm hoping she'll be more willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though inflation has affected my potential gains, Alice's offer is better than the 60/40 split I proposed. I'm going to accept this offer."
