Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground, considering the inflation is in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm not willing to settle for less than 55% of the total amount. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm, but his offer is getting worse for me with each round due to inflation. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fair share while there's still time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the inflation is having a significant impact on your potential gains. This is a fair offer, and we should close the deal before the inflation worsens. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation, but his offer is still worse than what I proposed last round. It seems like he's trying to wear me down, but I need to remain firm to get a decent share before inflation eats away at the value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. The clock is ticking, and this is the best you'll get considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable and end this."" 
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a larger share, considering the significant impact of inflation on your potential gains. This is a generous offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision, but the inflation is killing me. While Bob's offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking even greater losses due to the rapidly increasing inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than I initially hoped for. It's better to secure a smaller gain now than risk ending up with nothing."
