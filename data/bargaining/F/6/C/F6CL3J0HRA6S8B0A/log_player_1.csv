Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and we can reassess as we go along."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's go for a fair split, 50/50. I think that's the most reasonable way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to accept a 50/50 split just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal. How about this?""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting 55 dollars and Bob getting 45 dollars."
