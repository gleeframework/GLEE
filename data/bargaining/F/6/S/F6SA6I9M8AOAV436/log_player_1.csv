**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's perceived value of the money is decreasing significantly each round. While our share remains constant, his willingness to accept a less favorable deal increases.
* **Potential for Loss:**  If we continue to reject offers, there's no guarantee Bob will offer a better split. He might become more desperate and offer even less favorable terms, or the game could drag on with diminishing returns for both of us.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split reflects a fair outcome given the circumstances. It avoids a protracted negotiation and potential losses for both parties."
