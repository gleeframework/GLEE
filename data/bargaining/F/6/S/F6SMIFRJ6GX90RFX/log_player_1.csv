"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, knowing that inflation is a factor.  I want to secure a good amount for myself while leaving Bob with something to consider accepting."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a much worse deal for me than the one I proposed in the previous round, even with the inflation on his end. I'm going to reject this and see if we can find a more agreeable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and the inflation is making it even less appealing. I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

Even with the inflation impacting Bob, his offer is still too low.  I'm going to continue to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm getting a bit worried about the inflation, so I'm willing to lower my offer again. I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I need to make it appealing enough for Bob to accept."

While I'm not thrilled with the split, I'm starting to worry about the inflation impacting Bob's offers more and more.  I'm going to accept this and hope that we can avoid getting nothing at all."
