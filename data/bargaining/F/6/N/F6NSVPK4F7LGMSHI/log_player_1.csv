"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which is a generous offer considering the high stakes and the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 80% of the original amount, which is $400,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 95% of the original amount, but I'll assume it is.

Considering the proposal, I think it's a reasonable offer, and splitting it evenly seems like a fair way to start. I'll accept the offer.
