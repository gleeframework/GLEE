Alice's offer:

Let's see what Alice offers next!  I'm not sure I'm happy with this initial split.  It's not the worst deal, but I want to see if I can get more!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm going to propose a more even split, but I'm still keeping in mind the inflation factor.  I'll offer Alice a bit less than she got in the first round, but I'm sure she'll still be happy with this.  Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Okay, I'm going to accept this offer.  While it's not ideal, the inflation is really hurting Alice more than me, and I don't want to risk getting a worse offer in the next round."
