# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous one, I'm still holding out for a larger share. I'll reject and see if she'll come closer to my desired split in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us. Time is running out, and the money is losing value.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal. Let's split this evenly and call it a day. The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is fair and reasonable. With each passing round, the value of the money decreases, and it's getting too risky to keep rejecting offers.  It's time to accept and split the money evenly."
