"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for being the first to propose!""
}
```

Let me know what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a fair split would be 50/50, considering the diminishing value of money in each round. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the effective value of his offer. 

Bob's offer is:

```
# Effective Alice gain: 6000 (same as before)
# Effective Bob gain: 3200 (80% of 4000)
```

I think this is a good offer, and I'd rather not risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
