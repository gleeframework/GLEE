52.0,48.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My offer is now 52/48.  Let's be reasonable and end this before inflation eats away at the pot.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
43.0,57.0,I'm still not convinced. My offer is now 57/43. You're losing more to inflation than I am. Maybe it's time to reconsider.,Bob,6,
