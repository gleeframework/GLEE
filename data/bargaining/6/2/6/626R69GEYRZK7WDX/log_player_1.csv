"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the remaining money. I'll accept his offer.
