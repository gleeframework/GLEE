"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

My initial gain was 5000, and now it's worth 5% less, so it's 4750. Bob's gain is 6000, which is 20% less than his initial gain of 7500, so it's 6000.

Considering the relative values, I think I'd be better off accepting this offer. I'd get 4000, which is worth 4750 in real value, and Bob would get 6000, which is worth 6000 in real value. It's a better deal for me than my initial offer, and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal if I reject it.
