"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  This is the first round, so the money is worth the same for both of us.  Hopefully, he sees the value in taking a small amount now, rather than risking getting nothing at all in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my previous offer, but he's still getting a considerable amount. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round. I still have the advantage of inflation working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still offer a significant amount to Bob.  Inflation is starting to bite into Bob's potential gains, so I'm hoping he'll recognize that getting something now is better than risking nothing in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I was originally offering, and inflation is starting to seriously impact his potential earnings.  This is a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it."
