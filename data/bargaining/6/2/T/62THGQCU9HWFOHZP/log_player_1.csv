"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take the majority of the money in the first two rounds!

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to get a better deal by offering a smaller share to Bob. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it before we reach the 12th round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to even out the stakes!

I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50/50 split and it's a fair deal. I don't want to risk going to the 12th round and getting nothing!
