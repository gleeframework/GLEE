I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor. This gives me the majority of the money, but I'm willing to share some to start the negotiation."

I'm going to offer a split of 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob.  This is a more even split than my last offer, but still keeps me in the majority, and reflects the inflation effects we're experiencing."

The inflation is really biting now. I'm going to reject this offer, even though it's a lot better than what he offered before. I think I can get a better deal in the next round, with the hope that Bob is becoming more desperate too."
