"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is intended to demonstrate my understanding of the game. I aim to secure a large portion of the money while giving Bob a small amount to encourage him to accept, as he will get nothing if the game goes to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share. The inflation is a serious factor, and I don't want to risk losing everything. By giving Bob a more substantial share, I hope to incentivize him to accept and prevent the game from continuing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The inflation is hitting hard, and it's not likely to get better.  I need to secure some money, even if it's not the ideal split."
