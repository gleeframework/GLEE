"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a classic game theory problem!  While the offer seems tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice a smaller share, hoping to get the most for myself. Since inflation is a factor, I want to close the deal sooner rather than later.  Let's see if Alice is willing to accept!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 387500 
# Alice gain: 612500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is worse than her original offer, even after accounting for inflation.  I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to offer Alice a slightly smaller share than my previous offer, hoping to incentivize her to accept before the inflation hits harder."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 462375 
# Alice gain: 537625 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse with each round, even after factoring in inflation. I'm still hoping to get a better deal, so I'll reject again."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy. I'm offering Alice a slightly larger share this time, hoping to make the offer more appealing given the increasing inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520948 
# Alice gain: 479052 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still hopeful that I can get a larger share.  The inflation is making it harder to justify accepting anything less than a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's see if I can convince Alice to accept my offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

The inflation is starting to really hurt. I'm going to offer a slightly smaller share than my previous offer, hoping to close the deal before it gets too late."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 453247 
# Alice gain: 546753 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is really taking its toll now. Alice's offer is getting closer to 50/50, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll reject and try one more time to make an offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

With the inflation at this point, it's better to get something than nothing. I'm going to offer a 50/50 split, hoping Alice will agree. Let's see if this works!"
