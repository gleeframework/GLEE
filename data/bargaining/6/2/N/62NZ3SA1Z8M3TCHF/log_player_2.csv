Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. This is my final offer! 
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even though the offer is not great,  it's better than getting nothing.  Inflation is significantly hurting Alice's share, making it more likely she'll accept a lower offer in future rounds.  It's also a gamble on her being truthful about it being her final offer."
