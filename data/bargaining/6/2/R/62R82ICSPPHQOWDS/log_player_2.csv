"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm making the first move. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we should divide it more equally, considering I'm taking the inflation risk.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a smaller cut to end this quickly. It's better for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I believe I can get a better deal, considering the inflation risk I'm taking. Alice's offer doesn't compensate for the loss in value over time.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still need to account for the loss in value.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm accepting this offer because, considering the increasing inflation, getting 50% now is better than risking further loss in value in subsequent rounds. Splitting it evenly seems fair at this point, especially since Alice's gain isn't affected by inflation.\n\n###"
