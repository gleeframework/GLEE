"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent share and can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way we both get a good amount! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to reverse the original offer!

I'll reject his offer since it's not a good deal for me, considering the inflation. The money is worth less now, and I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""This is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's move on!""
