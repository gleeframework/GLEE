This is a fair offer to start the game. I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something.  Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  Even though the money is worth less, I'm getting half of what's left.  It's better to take the offer now than risk getting nothing."
