"Round 1
Alice's offer:

This is a terrible offer for Bob, and while Alice might think it's a quick way to get the most money, the inflation will hurt her more in the long run.  Let's see if Bob can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's the most sensible way to get the most out of this deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm still hoping to get the larger share.  Let's get this done before the value of our money drops even more! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is still getting a very bad deal here.  Alice's offer is even worse than her initial offer in terms of percentages, even though it's slightly better for Bob in terms of raw dollars. It seems like Alice is getting more and more greedy and might be willing to risk the whole deal for a little bit more.  Let's see if Bob can leverage this and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share.  If we don't reach an agreement soon, we both lose out due to inflation.  Let's be reasonable and make this work.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm still hoping to get the larger share.  Let's get this done before the value of our money drops even more! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still being very greedy and hasn't shown any willingness to compromise.  Even though her offer is slightly better than last round in terms of actual dollars, the percentage split is still extremely uneven and the value of the money is plummeting.  Let's see if Bob can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm starting to get frustrated with this process. We're losing a lot of money with each passing round.  This is my final offer. It's a fair split that benefits us both. Accept it, or we risk losing everything.""}
