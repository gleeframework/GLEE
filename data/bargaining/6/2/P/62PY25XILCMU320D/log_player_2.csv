"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money evenly to ensure a fair outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you want to split evenly, but the value of the money decreases for me each round.  How about a 60/40 split in my favor?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but the 60/40 split is not acceptable.  How about a compromise with a 55/45 split? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a difficult negotiation with the value decreasing for me each round.  55/45 is still too low for me.  How about we settle close to the middle at 56/44?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases significantly for you each round.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, it's clear Alice has the upper hand and understands the pressure of the devaluation. Taking a 40/60 split, while not ideal, is much better than risking another round where I'll be in a weaker position."
