"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a bigger chunk for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll, I need to be more careful with my decisions. Since Bob is offering a 50-50 split, I'll consider it a fair offer. I'll accept it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
