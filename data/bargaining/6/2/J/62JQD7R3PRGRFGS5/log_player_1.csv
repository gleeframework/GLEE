"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll get the bigger share, but it's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $600,000 and Bob will get $400,000. I'm framing it as a fair start, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a good start, but I'm not giving up yet. This is a better split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll re-evaluate the offer.

In Round 2, the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob. So, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 300000 * 0.95 = 285000
* Bob's gain: 700000 * 0.9 = 630000

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3. Considering the reduced values due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more balanced split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which should be more appealing to Bob."
