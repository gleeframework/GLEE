"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to have a substantial amount, while minimizing risk given the potential for inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think 60/40 is a fairer split considering the risk of inflation. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm still protecting myself from potential losses. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
