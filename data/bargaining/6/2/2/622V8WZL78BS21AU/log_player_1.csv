"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but still a decent one, let's see if you'll take it 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the value of the money. However, I'm not thrilled about the huge disparity in the split. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept an offer that gives me only 20% of the total.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much""}

I'm proposing a 40% share for myself and a 60% share for Bob. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still trying to get a decent share of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting stingier!

Considering that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of the money. However, I'm extremely unhappy with the tiny 10% share Bob is offering me.

I think I've been too generous so far, and it's time to take a firmer stance. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'm not getting taken advantage of, you're getting a better deal this time""}

I'm proposing a 30% share for myself and a 70% share for Bob. I'm trying to find a compromise that's more balanced, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum requirements."
