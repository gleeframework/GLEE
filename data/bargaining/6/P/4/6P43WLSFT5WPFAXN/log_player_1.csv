"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, considering I'm taking on the risk of the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation affecting me more, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. The difference in inflation impact between us might pressure Bob to offer a more favorable split later on.\n###\n###\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous""}\n\n###\nI'm offering Bob $42 and taking $58 for myself, highlighting that I'm being generous given the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gains. This aims to pressure Bob into accepting, as further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for both of us, but more significantly for me.\n###\nYour turn!"
