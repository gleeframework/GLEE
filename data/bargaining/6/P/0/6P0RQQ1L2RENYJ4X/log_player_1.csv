"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can negotiate later.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. I'm hoping he'll accept this reasonable offer and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so the effective amount I'd gain is 0.95 * 60 = 57.

Bob's offer is to split the money 50-50, which means I'd gain $50. This is more than my previous offer, but considering the inflation, it's actually a worse deal for me than the 60-40 split I initially proposed.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to make a new proposal for Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. In this round, the effective amount I'd gain is 0.95 * 57 = 54.15.

I'll make a new proposal, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's offer was 50-50, which was less favorable to me than my initial 60-40 split.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You said meet in the middle, but I'll try to get a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is still a relatively fair split, but slightly more in my favor. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I'd gain is 0.8587 * 60 = 51.522.

Bob's offer is to split the money 45-55, which is a 9-11 split, and a worse deal for me than my previous offer. However, considering the inflation, it's actually a relatively good deal for me compared to the original offer.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise and I don't want to risk losing out on any more money due to the decreasing value of the currency.
