"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me the majority of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll consider the effective value of the offer as:

Alice gain: 70 * 0.9 = 63
Bob gain: 30 * 0.8 = 24

I'll accept Bob's offer.
