  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

I reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're still offering me too little. I want more.""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will come back with an even more generous offer in the next round."

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money I gain in this round being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be very cautious.

However, Bob's offer is still a bit too low for my taste. I'll try to push for a better deal.

I reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I need more, I'm not giving up yet.""

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, I'm not getting any younger!""
