"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to end the game here."
