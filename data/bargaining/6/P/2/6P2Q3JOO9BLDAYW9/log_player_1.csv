"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point where I get significantly less than half."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your 60/40 split isn't reasonable. This is my counter-offer: I get 5500, you get 4500.  The inflation is working against you, so let's settle this now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's a fair deal given the inflation, and we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is acceptable at this stage. The inflation is significantly impacting his potential gains with each passing round, making my current share more appealing. Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of further diminishing returns for both of us."
