```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and see how it goes!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

```

I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'd like to think that I deserve a bit more, considering the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 5200 is a fair share, given the circumstances. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve the majority of the remaining value!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to find a compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a compromise, and I'm not sure if I should accept it. With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, a 50-50 split might not be the best deal for me.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better than this, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money being even less valuable. Let's take the compromise.
