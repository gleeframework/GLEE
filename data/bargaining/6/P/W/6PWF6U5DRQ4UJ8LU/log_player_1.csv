"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll reject Bob's offer. His offer is too skewed towards his gain, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value fast! I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer again. His offer is still too skewed towards his gain, and I'd like to try to get a better deal before the value of the money drops too much further.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I'll aim for a more aggressive split to try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
