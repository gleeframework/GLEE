"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm looking for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept a smaller share due to the inflation.
