"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Bob, but I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share than the decreasing value of money would suggest. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
