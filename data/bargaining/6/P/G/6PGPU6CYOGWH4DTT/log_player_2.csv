"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, it's effectively $900,000. I'll make an offer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 580,000 / 0.81 = 715,000
* Alice's gain: 420,000 / 0.909 = 462,000

I'll accept Alice's offer.
