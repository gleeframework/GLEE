"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small portion of the initial $100, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair 50/50 split, no need to negotiate more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $50 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $45.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I was hoping for a better deal, considering the inflation effect. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but don't expect it to last!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but still a relatively small portion of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $45 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is approximately $32.64.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a slight improvement from my previous offer, I still think I can get a better deal. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm getting desperate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $35, which is a relatively small portion of the initial $100, and a smaller share than in my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to give up yet! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is now worth 59.05% of its original value, which is approximately $23.62.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, although it's not ideal, the inflation effect has significantly reduced the value of the money, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in future rounds."
