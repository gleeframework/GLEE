"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering Bob 60 dollars, which is a fair share considering the initial amount is $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.
