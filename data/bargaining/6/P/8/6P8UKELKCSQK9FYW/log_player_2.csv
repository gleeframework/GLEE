Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate and the value of her share is plummeting. I need to hold out for a better deal. While the difference seems small, it's crucial in these later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be real. This is the most fair deal you'll get. Take it before inflation eats away more of your share.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We're past the halfway point, and Alice is likely feeling the pressure of inflation. Offering a 50/50 split might seem generous from my perspective, but it's the most logical choice now:

* **Fairness:**  It presents a strong case that I'm negotiating in good faith.
* **Urgency:**  The message highlights the time constraint and the diminishing value for Alice. 

If Alice rejects this, she's gambling on getting more than 50% in later rounds, which is becoming increasingly unlikely given the inflation."
