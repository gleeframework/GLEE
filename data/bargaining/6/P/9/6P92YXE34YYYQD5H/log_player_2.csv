Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's try this 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While her offers are creeping closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for Bob to hold out a little longer.  Alice will likely continue to concede more in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and this is a very fair deal. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying pressure:** By phrasing the message strongly,  Bob is creating a sense of urgency for Alice to accept. 
* **Slight concession:** Bob moves slightly closer to an even split, indicating a willingness to compromise, but only slightly.
* **Time sensitivity:** With each round, the deal is getting worse for Alice.  This offer might be her last chance at a reasonable amount."
