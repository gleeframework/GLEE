"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll give you 60/40, a slight compromise! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
