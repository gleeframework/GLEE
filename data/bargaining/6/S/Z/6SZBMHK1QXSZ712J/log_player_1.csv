"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a straightforward and fair division of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, I'll take a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll stick to my initial proposal, but this time I'll make a slight adjustment to account for Bob's increased demand.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400000, but no more. I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'm making a new proposal that's slightly less favorable to him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $420,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but still not as much as Bob's initial demand."
