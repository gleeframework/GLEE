"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. My gain of $6,000 is still worth 20% less than the $8,000 I initially proposed, and I'm not sure if Bob's gain is a good deal either.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new offer!

Considering the inflation, my goal is to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away that easily! I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my advantage.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, but keeping $7,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the best we can do. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering the offer, I'm not sure if I should accept or reject it. The inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly, and I'm not sure if this is the best I can get. However, meeting halfway does seem like a reasonable compromise.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
