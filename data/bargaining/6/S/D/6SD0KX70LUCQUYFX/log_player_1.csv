I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, keeping in mind the inflation risk. I believe this is a fair starting point.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm willing to reduce my share again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. It's time for a compromise.  I think this 75/25 split is a fair and achievable solution."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering the same split but now in my favor, the inflation is taking a huge toll, and I'm not willing to settle for a significantly smaller share than what I've been offering.  I'll reject this offer and see if Bob becomes more reasonable in the next rounds."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

Inflation is getting out of control, but I'm not giving up on getting a fair share of the money.  I'm reducing my share again, offering a 70/30 split.  It's a risk, but with the inflation hurting Bob more, I hope he sees the value in this deal."
