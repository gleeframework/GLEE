"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, knowing that the value will decrease faster for Bob than for me. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's a good amount for me right now, I know I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation hurts Bob more than me, so he'll likely make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering a more even split this time, knowing that inflation is still working in my favor.  I'm confident this will be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting.  While this offer is better than his last one, inflation is still hitting him harder.  He'll likely make a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm going to try a middle ground again, seeing if Bob is willing to compromise. Inflation is getting pretty intense now, so I need to find a balance between securing a decent amount for myself and avoiding running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting.  This offer is quite low, but I'm confident I can do better. We're getting into the later rounds now, and inflation is hitting Bob significantly harder. He'll need to improve his offer soon to avoid losing a lot of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

With only 5 rounds left, I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  The inflation is now biting both of us significantly, and I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise for Bob. We're getting closer to the end, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
