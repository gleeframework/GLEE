I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point given the inflation rates."

I'm reducing my share by 100,000, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept before further inflation devalues the money even more."

This is a very unfavorable offer for me. While I understand the inflation rates,  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself."

I'm willing to reduce my share again, but I'm nearing my limit. I believe this offer reflects the current inflation rates and still allows for a reasonable outcome for both of us."

This offer is incredibly unfair. While I understand the inflation dynamics, I still believe there's potential for a more equitable split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm lowering my share once more, but I'm approaching a point where further reductions would be unsustainable. This offer represents a compromise that acknowledges inflation but also ensures a reasonable share for myself."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 999000

This offer is simply insulting. While I recognize the impact of inflation,  I'm not willing to accept such a paltry sum. I still believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Given the severe impact of inflation, especially on my earnings, I propose an even split. This seems like the only fair solution considering the current circumstances."
