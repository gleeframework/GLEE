4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, that's a very generous offer on your part, but I think we can find something a bit more balanced. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  Think it over carefully, as the pot shrinks with each round!",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 55/45 split is more equitable. It's closer to a 50/50 split, and we both get a decent amount. Let's not let the money shrink further. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, I appreciate the movement towards a more even split.  How about this: I take 52%, you take 48%. It's a slight edge for me, but still a good deal for both of us considering the time pressure. Let's close this out and not risk losing more to inflation!",Bob,4,
