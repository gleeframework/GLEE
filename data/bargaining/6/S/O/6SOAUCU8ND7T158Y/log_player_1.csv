"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's find a more balanced split. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This acknowledges the risk you're taking with inflation while ensuring a fairer outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
