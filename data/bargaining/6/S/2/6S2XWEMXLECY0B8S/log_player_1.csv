Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 60

Explanation: 

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice given the circumstances and the rapidly decreasing value of the money for Alice due to the inflation mechanic. 

Here's why:

* **Rapidly Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the value Alice gains decreases by 20%.  Waiting any longer means a significantly smaller payout, even if she could secure a slightly better deal in a future round.
* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer. There's no guarantee he'll offer anything better in subsequent rounds, and he's likely to offer even less.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees Alice at least 40% of the initial value. Rejecting means risking getting a much lower amount, potentially even nothing if the game continues.

While the game has a psychological element of bargaining, the mathematical reality of the inflation makes accepting this offer the most rational choice for Alice."
