"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm only facing a 10% inflation rate while Bob is dealing with a 20% inflation rate.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, and the inflation rate is only going to make things worse for him.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm going to offer a 55/45 split in my favor.  Bob's offer was a bit too aggressive, and he's going to face even higher inflation in the next round. This seems like a fair compromise that accounts for the inflation differential."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although this is less than my initial offer, Bob's inflation rate is now significantly higher than mine.  Accepting this offer ensures that I get at least something, and it's likely that if I reject, the next round will result in a worse outcome for me due to the escalating inflation."
