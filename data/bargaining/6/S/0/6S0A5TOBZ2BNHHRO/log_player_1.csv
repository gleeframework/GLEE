```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. It's not a 50-50 split, but it's not a bad offer either. I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, but I'll wait for Bob's next offer to see if I can get a better deal."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
