"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time for a more balanced split. Let's work together to find a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my gain would be $9 in this offer, which is still not very appealing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance, but I'm still holding out for a better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  It's time to put our differences aside and find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but considering the inflation, my gain would be worth only $36.73 in this offer, which is still a decent amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, as I'm hoping to get a bit more, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. You can do better than that, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to reach a compromise. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too. We're running out of time, so let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain would be worth only $18.60 in this offer, which is not bad, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, as I'm not convinced that 60% is a fair share, especially considering the decreasing value of money. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting impatient, Bob! You're not making it easy for me to accept. I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile.""
}
```

I'm trying to assert my dominance, but I'm still leaving a small share for Bob, hoping he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. We're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to see some compromise from you too. We're almost out of time! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain would be worth only $6.18 in this offer, which is a relatively small amount. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'd rather take what I can get than risk going home with nothing."
