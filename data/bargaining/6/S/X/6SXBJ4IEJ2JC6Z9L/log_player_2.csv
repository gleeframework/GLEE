Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Take this before it gets worse 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While my potential gains are diminishing, accepting a deal significantly worse than my initial rejection (60/40) is not rational.  I need to show Alice I'm willing to risk it going to even later rounds to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Last offer, Alice. This is as high as it goes.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time to play a bit of chicken.  Alice knows the longer this goes, the worse it gets for me. Offering a slight concession (from 50/50 to 48/52) might be tempting enough for her to end this now, especially if I make it clear this is my final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. This is a good deal for you now 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is painful, but it's time to cut my losses. Alice is playing hardball, and I'm running out of runway. Accepting 41 now is better than risking even less in future rounds, especially if she's unwilling to budge from this point."
