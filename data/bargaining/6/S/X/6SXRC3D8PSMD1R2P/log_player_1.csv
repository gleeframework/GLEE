"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2500. I believe this is fair given the potential inflation over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise with a 2:1 ratio. This way, we both get a decent share and can minimize the impact of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
