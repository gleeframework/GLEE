Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60% and you get 40% - a fair deal considering the inflation working against me.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous proposal was unfair considering the inflation. I propose a compromise: 55% for me and 45% for you. This ensures we both get a decent amount before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
