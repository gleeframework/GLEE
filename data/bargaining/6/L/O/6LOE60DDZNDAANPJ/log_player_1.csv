"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, where each of us gets $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'm actually getting $4500 (5000 * 0.9). Bob's offer is $4000, which is less than that.

I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, while still considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's calculate the actual value of the money I'd get from Bob's offer: $4500 / (1 - 0.271) = $4500 / 0.729 â‰ˆ $6195.12

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm actually getting a bit more than my original $5000. Bob's offer is still a bit stingy, but I'll take it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
