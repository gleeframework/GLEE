"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This is a good starting point that gives me a large share while still leaving Bob with something. I'm confident that he will accept this offer, especially since we have 12 rounds and the money will be worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $200,000 and keep $800,000 for myself.  Bob rejected my previous offer, but his counter-offer was too low.  This offer is still fair to him, and with the increasing inflation, he's losing value on his share each round.  I'm hoping he'll accept this before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I will reject this offer. While it does represent a significant increase from Bob's previous offer, I still believe I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation working against Bob's offer each round. I need to hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $700,000 for myself and $300,000 for Bob. This is a fair compromise, considering the inflation that is affecting Bob's potential gains.  I believe this offer is reasonable, and I hope Bob will finally see that it's in his best interest to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me, given the increasing inflation against Bob. It is a 50/50 split, which is fairer than any of his previous offers. I accept!"
