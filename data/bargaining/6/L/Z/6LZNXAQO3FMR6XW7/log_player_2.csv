Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** Even though I'm losing 9.75% of the value from Round 1, Alice is losing a significantly larger 19%. This means my offer is more attractive to her.
* **Fairness:** 50/50 split is the most fair in this situation, considering the inflation impact is disproportionately higher for Alice.
* **Risk:** By rejecting, we risk further rounds of negotiation. This could result in a worse outcome for me, especially with the ongoing inflation."
