"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm going for a big chunk, but I'm giving Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a lot fairer than my first proposal, but I'm going to try to push for more. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, and I want to see if he's willing to budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my share a bit, but still give Bob a significant portion to show I'm willing to negotiate. The inflation is starting to bite, so I want to make sure I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting a bit risky. Bob is pushing for more, and the value of the money is dropping fast. I'm going to reject his offer. I believe I can still get a better deal, but I need to be careful not to push too far."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a middle ground. I'm increasing my share a bit, but still offering Bob a significant portion. The inflation is really starting to impact the money, so I need to find a compromise.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to accept a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The value of the money is shrinking rapidly, but I can't let Bob dictate the terms like this. I'm confident I can get a better deal, and I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to try one last time to get a deal. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to convince him that we're getting closer to a reasonable split. The inflation is getting scary now, but I still believe we can find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting very risky.  The money is worth significantly less now, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out.  Bob is offering a reasonable amount, considering the circumstances. I'm going to accept his offer."
