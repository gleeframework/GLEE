"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced, accepting this offer would leave me with significantly less than half of the initial amount. It's worth risking another round to negotiate a better deal, even with the shrinking pot."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, and inflation is on my side 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is correct, time is running out. However, her offer is getting worse with each round. I need to hold firm and hope she realizes a deal, even with a smaller share for her, is better than nothing in the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is generous considering how much inflation is hurting my share.  Let's be reasonable and end this now.""}

# Alice's message: I'll take a bigger share, inflation is crippling your gain 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The game has reached a critical point. While the offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking a worse outcome in the following rounds where inflation will further erode my potential gain. Accepting secures a disappointing but still tangible amount."
