"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, hoping Bob will be tempted to take it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 98, ""bob_gain"": 2}
```

I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm reducing my share slightly to make it a bit more appealing to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll see that rejecting this offer might lead to even less for him in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of maximizing my share. I'm confident Bob will eventually come around to a more even split as the rounds continue."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 97, ""bob_gain"": 3}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share by one dollar each round. This keeps the pressure on Bob, while still giving me a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3 
# Bob gain: 97 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 96, ""bob_gain"": 4}
```

I'm still trying to get the majority of the money, but with only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to think Bob might be more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4 
# Bob gain: 96 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm continuing to reject these offers. It seems Bob is just as determined to get the majority of the money as I am!  But with only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only three rounds left, I'm switching tactics. I'm proposing an even split. I think Bob will realize that it's better to get 50 dollars than to risk getting nothing at all.  It's a risky move, but I think it's our best chance of getting something."
