"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront so we both benefit from avoiding inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's not a bad offer, but Bob should aim for a better split to take advantage of the inflation rate favoring him.  Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than your initial offer. This split is more equitable, and we can avoid the harshest effects of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and inflation is eating our money. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but Bob can still hold out for a better deal. The offer is slightly better than her first, but it's still not taking into account the higher inflation rate that Alice is facing. Let's see if Bob can get a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's not wait for inflation to devour our money, Alice. I'm willing to compromise, but this split reflects the reality of our individual inflation rates. Accept this offer, and we can both walk away with a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! This is a compromise, and it benefits us both to stop the inflation from bleeding us dry. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is becoming increasingly attractive as the inflation rates continue to escalate.  While Bob could try for a slightly better deal, the risk of reaching the end of the game and getting nothing is too high. This offer provides a decent gain for Bob, even with the inflation impact, and it's the best way to ensure he doesn't lose out entirely."
