"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'd rather get a larger share now to compensate for the future devaluation. I reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less, I think I should take this offer to get a slightly larger share before the value of money drops further.
