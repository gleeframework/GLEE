I'm going for a big chunk, knowing that Bob's share will be worth significantly less in the next round.  Let's see how he likes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep pushing for more, the inflation factor is making Bob's offer more appealing. I'm taking it to secure a guaranteed 500,000."
