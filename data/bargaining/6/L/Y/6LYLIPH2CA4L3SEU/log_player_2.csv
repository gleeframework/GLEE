"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. I'll take $6000 and you'll take $4000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I know the money is worth less to Alice each round, so I'll try to exploit that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than an even split.  I'll take $7000 and you can have $3000.  This way, we both get something, and it's still a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money equally, taking into account the decreasing value of the currency. Each of us will receive $5000. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  An equal split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
