"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money and Bob 10%. It's a pretty generous offer considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping Bob will be happy to accept it and end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal.  Even though the money I receive is the same, it's worth less because the money Bob receives is worth 20% less.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 850,000 for me and 150,000 for Bob. I'm still hopeful that this is a fair offer considering the inflation and Bob's decreasing returns.  Let's see if he'll take it this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough for me.  While I'm receiving more than his previous offer, his gains are worth significantly less due to inflation.  I'm going to keep rejecting these offers and see if I can get a more equitable deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer a bit more to 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob.  The inflation is starting to impact my gains as well, so I need to make sure I'm getting a decent amount before it gets too late. Let's see if Bob is more agreeable to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but I'm still not happy with it. His gains are worth much less than in the first round, while mine are still the same. I'm going to try to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer one more time to 750,000 for me and 250,000 for Bob. The inflation is really starting to affect both of us, so I need to make a move soon.  This offer is still pretty generous considering Bob's gains are worth significantly less than in the first round. Let's see if he'll finally agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough. While I'm receiving more than his previous offer, his gains are worth drastically less due to inflation. I'm going to try and hold out for a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm going to make a counter-offer to Bob's last proposal.  I'm lowering my requested amount to 700,000, which is still a fair amount considering his gains are worth significantly less due to inflation. I'm hoping that this offer will be enough to finally reach an agreement and end the game before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting very risky. While Bob's gains are worth significantly less, I'm still getting a pretty good share, and we are running out of time. I'm going to accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
