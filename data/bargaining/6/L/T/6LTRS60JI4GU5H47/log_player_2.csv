"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer is not terrible, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Since Bob's money is worth less in each round, it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, Alice, but inflation will hurt me more as we continue. This offer is fair, considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation while still giving us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is really starting to hurt. Accepting this offer is the best option to ensure I get *something* before the value of my share dwindles even further."
