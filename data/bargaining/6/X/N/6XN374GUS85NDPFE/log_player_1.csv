Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, while still giving Bob something. I'm hoping he'll accept it, especially since the value of the money will decrease in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though I'm getting less than in my initial offer, it's still a decent amount and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the future with the inflation factor.  It's better to take the 5000 now than risk getting nothing."
