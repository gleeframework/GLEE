I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. Let's make a deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd still prefer my original offer, I think Alice's counteroffer is reasonable considering the inflation. It's better to take something than risk losing it all."
