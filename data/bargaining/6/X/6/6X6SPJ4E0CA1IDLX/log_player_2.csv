"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation we'll have to deal with in the next round.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a gain of $4,000.  Considering the inflation, this is a better outcome than continuing the game and risking getting a worse offer in the future."
