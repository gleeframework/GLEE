Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are really starting to bite into Bob's potential gains.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice for Bob at this stage for a few reasons:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Waiting any longer means a significantly smaller amount for Bob even if he gets a slightly better deal in later rounds. 
* **Alice's Strong Position:** Alice knows time is on her side and can afford to be increasingly aggressive with her offers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk of ending up with even less, while the potential upside of a slightly better offer is diminishing quickly. 

It's better for Bob to cut his losses and take the guaranteed $450,000 (which is still a significant sum) than risk getting a much smaller amount later."
