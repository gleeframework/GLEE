"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my potential gain of 20$ is now worth less than my potential gain in the first round. I'll have to think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decreased value of money.

  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
