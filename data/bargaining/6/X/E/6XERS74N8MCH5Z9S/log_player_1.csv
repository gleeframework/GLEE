"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 55-45, a more equitable start. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I now need to consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power.

Since Bob's offer is 55-45, and considering the inflation effect, I'd be gaining 45 units of money that are worth 20% less than the original 60 units I proposed, which is equivalent to 48 units. Bob would gain 55 units, which is worth 10% less than the original 55 units he proposed, which is equivalent to 49.5 units.

Considering the inflation effect, I think 48 units is a reasonable offer, and I'd rather accept this offer than risk going to the next round.
