"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""I believe this is a fair split in our current position, Bob.  What do you think?""

Let's see if Bob goes for this 70/30 split in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn!  I think this offer reflects the changing value of the money going forward. Do you agree? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is insulting! While he claims it reflects the changing value, he's trying to take advantage of the situation.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not under duress.  Let's see what he proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable.  Your last offer was unacceptable. I'm proposing a compromise that acknowledges the time pressure we're both under. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

This offer is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, as I need to apply pressure and signal the seriousness of the situation to Bob.  He needs to understand that stalling only benefits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It reflects the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money. Let's end this now and both get something! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  Bob is clearly dug in, and while I'm doing better than his offer from Round 2, the inflation is working against me.  It's better to take a less-than-ideal deal now than risk getting even less in a few more rounds."
