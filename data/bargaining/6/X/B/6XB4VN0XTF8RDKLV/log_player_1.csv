Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, and I think we can both be happy with it.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a bit biased, how about we do 55/45? It's closer to equal and I think we can both live with it. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
