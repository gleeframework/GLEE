"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a bold move. I'll take the whole pie if I can!""
}
```

I'm making a strong opening offer, taking the entire $100 for myself. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the risk of inflation, I propose a fair split of the remaining funds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is being reasonable, considering the inflation factor.

I'll consider the offer and respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the risk of inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the remaining funds, which is a 10% increase from the 50/50 split. My message is a gentle nudge, hinting that I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slightly larger share."
