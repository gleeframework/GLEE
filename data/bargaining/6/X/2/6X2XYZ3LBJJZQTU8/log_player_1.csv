Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I understand the inflation pressure, but your offer was too skewed. I'm proposing 58/42 - it's a compromise considering the circumstances.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your side, I think 57/43 is a more suitable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is trying to position his offer as a compromise, it's important to remember that *my* buying power decreases with each round. Accepting $4,300 now is significantly worse than accepting even $4,500 in the previous round. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation to secure a larger portion. I need to hold firm to encourage a more balanced deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The longer this goes on, the less appealing any deal becomes for both of us. I'm offering you 4500, take it or leave it. This is your last chance for a decent share.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is severely impacting me now, and I need to act decisively. This offer represents a significant concession on my part from previous rounds. It's crucial to convey the urgency of the situation to Bob. By framing this as his ""last chance"" for a favorable deal, I'm hoping he'll recognize that pushing his luck further could result in a worse outcome for him in the long run."
