Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to a more agreeable split, time is running out more for Alice than it is for Bob.  Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation rate more acutely.  Bob can afford to hold out a little longer and see if Alice will propose a more favorable deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Time is running out.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is the most straightforward and equitable solution. It eliminates the need for further negotiation and minimizes the risk of reaching no agreement. 
* **Urgency:**  Alice is likely feeling the pressure of the higher inflation rate and will be more amenable to a deal that guarantees her a reasonable share."
