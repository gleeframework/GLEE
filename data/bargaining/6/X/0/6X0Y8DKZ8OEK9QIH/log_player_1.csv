"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with something. It's a starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively fair deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, accepting it now is the best option.  

* **Inflation:** If I reject this, I know Bob will get a much better deal in the next round due to the inflated value of money for him. 
* **Risk:** Continuing the game increases the risk of getting nothing at all, as the number of rounds is limited.

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
