"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. 60/40 split seems reasonable.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55/45. It's more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it evenly this time.  Let's avoid further negotiation and end this.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more. You're losing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, at this point, accepting Bob's offer is the most rational choice. With each round, my share is worth significantly less due to inflation, making it increasingly difficult to achieve a favorable outcome."
