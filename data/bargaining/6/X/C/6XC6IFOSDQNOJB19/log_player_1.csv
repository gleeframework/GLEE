"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 40% is a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counteroffer!

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 45%, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting hard!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of my potential gain, I'm not thrilled about accepting 25% of the total. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

After weighing my options, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up that much. I'd like to propose another counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the rapid inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a majority, but I need to get something for myself.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to push for an even better deal!"
