"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, I'll get the majority and we can move on with our lives.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not giving you the majority 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to be cautious about accepting a smaller share. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
