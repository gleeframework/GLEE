"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 seems reasonable.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one. Consider this a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the money is worth less, but I'm not getting any younger.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 25-75 split. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. 42-58 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 42-58 split, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. This is my best offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly, and I need to be strategic.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 45-55 split. It's not ideal, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value."
