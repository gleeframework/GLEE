"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be reasonable, Alice, but your initial offer was too skewed. Let's find a middle ground.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. This offer still gives you a good chunk, and time is ticking for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice is moving closer to a more balanced split, accepting a 40/60 split after two rounds of inflation still leaves a significant amount of money on the table for me. I need to push for a better deal in the next few rounds.
