"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I propose we divide it 70:30. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take a quick $300,000, it's worth considering that the value of that money will decrease significantly with inflation.  It's better to see what Alice proposes in the next round and assess the potential gains from rejecting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60:40 split is a more equitable and fair division. Let's move forward with this proposal.""}
