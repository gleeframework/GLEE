"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority and you can have the rest. Let's see if you can do better next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, in the hopes that he'll think it's a lowball and try to do better next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm hoping to get a better deal next time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less this round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 * 0.8 = 3200
* Bob gain: 6000 * 0.8 = 4800

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now effectively $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8^2).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this round, but I'm not getting any younger! Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's split it 50/50 and end this game! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the total amount is now effectively $5,280 (10,000 * 0.5162).

However, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 * 0.5162 = 2580.1
* Bob gain: 5000 * 0.5162 = 2580.1

I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50/50 split and it's getting increasingly difficult to negotiate a better deal with each passing round.
