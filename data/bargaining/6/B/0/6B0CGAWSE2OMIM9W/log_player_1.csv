"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair and reasonable tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can't do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than 40. I'll make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I can do better than 40, I'll give you 35 and take 65""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the further decrease in value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but still a fair offer""
}
```"
