"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to consider accepting the offer and ending the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, my new gain would be 9000 * 0.9 = 8100.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure an even split is the best option, considering the inflation. Let's try to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and sending a message to Bob to continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so my new gain would be 8100 * 0.9 = 7290.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7290,
  ""bob_gain"": 2710,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a decent share. Let's see if this works for you!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair deal, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, my new gain would be 9000 * (1 - 0.271) = 6283.3.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it down the middle is the best option, considering the inflation has already taken a big chunk out of my potential gain. Let's see if we can do better!""
}

Round 5
