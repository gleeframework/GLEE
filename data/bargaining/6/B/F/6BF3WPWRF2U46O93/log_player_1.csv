"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted even, but I'll start with a slight advantage 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's a good idea to start with Bob having a $2,000 advantage. I'd like to try to negotiate for a more even split. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but not too much!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a $1,000 advantage, but I'm not going to give up too much. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob than the previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're giving me a small edge, now it's my turn to take a bigger bite 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy about Bob's increasing his advantage again. I think I should try to hold my ground and negotiate for a more even split. I'll make a new offer in the next round.

Also, I'm getting a bit concerned about the inflation rate... it's affecting my gains significantly!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's get back to an even split!""}

I'm going back to my original proposal from Round 1, hoping that Bob will reconsider and accept an even split."
