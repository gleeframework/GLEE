I'm going for a greedy approach in the first round. I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm not sure I can get a better deal. The money is already worth 5% less, and if I reject this, I'll be the one making the offer in the next round, facing another 5% loss.  Accepting this ensures I get something, even if it's not ideal."
