"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I think an even split is the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I think an even split is a fair proposal, and I'd be happy to accept it.
