"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be practical. Time is money, and with inflation eating into my share, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. How about a 52/48 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
