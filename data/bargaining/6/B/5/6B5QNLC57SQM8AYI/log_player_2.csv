Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  This is a good deal for both of us if we agree now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's finally time to accept. While not ideal, waiting any longer will result in Alice receiving even less, making it harder to strike a deal where I get a larger share than her. Accepting a 50/50 split now ensures I don't risk getting a worse deal later."
