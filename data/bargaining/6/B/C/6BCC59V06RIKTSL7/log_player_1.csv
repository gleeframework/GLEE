"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $6,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250
* Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16

I'll accept Bob's offer.
