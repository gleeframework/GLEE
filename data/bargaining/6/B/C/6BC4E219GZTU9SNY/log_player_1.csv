Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as he's likely to get a much smaller share in future rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Inflation is a real threat, and the longer we go, the more likely we are to lose a significant amount of money. This offer ensures a fair split, and I'm willing to take that."
