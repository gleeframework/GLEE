"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20% of the $100, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need for negotiations, just a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept it because it's a 50-50 split, which is a relatively fair deal given the circumstances. I'd rather not risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
