"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a 30% share of the original $1,000,000. I'm keeping the remaining 70% for myself. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was being too generous in the first round, does he?

Considering the inflation rates, the money is now worth less than in the previous round. My gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think carefully before responding...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject this offer. I think I can do better than this!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth even less now. My gain of $400,000 in the previous round is worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 64% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't get too excited!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still keeping the majority. Let's see if he'll take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous enough, I'll take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the lead!

Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth even less now. My gain of $450,000 in the previous round is worth 85.75% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 55.2% of what it was in the first round.

However, Bob's new offer is quite different from the previous one. He's offering me a significantly smaller share this time.

I'll think carefully before responding...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept this offer. I think it's time to wrap up the game, and I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk getting an even smaller one in future rounds."
