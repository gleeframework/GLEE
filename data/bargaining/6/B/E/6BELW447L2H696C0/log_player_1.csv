"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fairly generous offer considering the potential for inflation in future rounds. I believe Bob will be motivated to accept this offer to secure some of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical decision. Inflation means my next offer will be worth less, and there's no guarantee Bob will make another even split in the future. It's better to secure half now than risk getting nothing later."
