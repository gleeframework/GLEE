Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money I gain due to inflation, I need to reassess the situation. Even though Bob's offer of an even split might seem fair at first glance, the fact that my share is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round means I'm actually getting less value. Given the circumstances, I think I can try to negotiate a bit more in my favor.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the current state of inflation and see how Bob responds.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, need a bit more to make up for it.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the drastic decrease in the value of the money I gain due to inflation, which is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I have to carefully consider Bob's offer. His proposal of $48 for me and $52 for him might seem close to an even split at face value, but the impact of inflation means I'm getting significantly less value. However, Bob has stated that this is his final offer, which adds a layer of urgency to my decision.\n\nConsidering the risk of further devaluation and the possibility of ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, I might need to accept this offer, even though it's not ideal for me.\n\nHowever, the strategy in this game involves risk assessment and sometimes pushing for a better deal. Given that Bob has made it clear this is his final offer, it might be a strategic move to reject it and try to force a more favorable outcome in the next rounds, despite the risk of further inflation.\n\nAfter careful consideration, my decision is:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm choosing to reject Bob's offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round, despite the risks involved.\n\nLet's proceed with my next proposal, taking into account the current state of inflation and the urgency of the situation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I believe we can do better than your 'final' offer.""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is it, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the extreme decrease in the value of the money I gain due to inflation, which is now worth 79.03% less than in the first round, I have to make a very difficult decision. Bob's offer of $47 for me and $53 for him, accompanied by a message that implies this is truly his last offer, puts me in a tough spot.\n\nGiven the immense devaluation of the money for me and the fact that we are running out of rounds, the risk of not reaching an agreement and ending up with nothing is very high. At this point, accepting Bob's offer might be the safest choice, despite it being far from ideal for me.\n\nAfter weighing the risks and considering the significant impact of inflation, my decision is:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm choosing to accept Bob's offer, as the risk of further negotiations not leading to a favorable outcome is too high, and the devaluation of the money makes every round more costly for me.\n\nLet's conclude the game with Bob's last offer.\n\n###\n\nThe final division is $47 for me and $53 for Bob. Given the circumstances and the impact of inflation, I hope this was the best decision under the pressure of the game's progression."
