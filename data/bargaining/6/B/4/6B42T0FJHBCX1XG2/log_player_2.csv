# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me hard, need a bit more to make up for it. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but we're only halfway through the rounds. While her perceived value of the money is decreasing, the actual amount is not. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to start pushing a bit harder. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to add some pressure on Alice. A 52/48 split is still in my favor, and with the inflation working against her, it's getting less appealing to wait for potentially better offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a risk, but I believe we can do better than your 'final' offer. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure and trying to call my bluff.  However, her offer is still worse than what I proposed in Round 6.  I'll hold firm and see if she panics with the increasing inflation working against her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""This is it, Alice. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close to the end. It's time to increase the pressure while still offering a slightly better deal than she's proposed. By making it clear this is my absolute final offer, I'm hoping she'll cave and accept a 53/47 split rather than risk getting nothing."
