Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the inflation affects you more 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  The inflation is working against me, but I need to hold my ground a bit longer to secure a less terrible deal.  Bob is likely aware of the pressure the inflation puts on me, so he might be trying to exploit that."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""The inflation is hurting us both, Bob. This offer ensures we both get a decent share while there's still value left.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases for me. I need to make a deal soon.
* **Concession:** My offer is a slight concession from my previous one, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Framing:**  By emphasizing the shared loss due to inflation, I'm trying to appeal to Bob's rational side and encourage a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm increasing my share, as the inflation is hitting you harder 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Bob is correct that inflation is hitting me hard. However, his offer is barely better than his initial offer. Accepting this would set a bad precedent and he might just keep pushing for a larger share.  I need to hold out hope that he will offer a more equitable split, or I will be forced to accept an even worse deal soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. Any more delays and we'll both lose out significantly.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is a strong statement that I'm not willing to negotiate further. 
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is undeniably fair, especially considering the inflation working against me.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the time pressure, hoping Bob understands we're both losing out by not taking this deal.

At this point, Bob is being unreasonable if he continues to demand a larger share. He risks getting nothing if he waits too long. This offer is my final stand, and I'm prepared to walk away if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're feeling the pinch of inflation, I'm not. I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm extremely unhappy to accept this, but it's the best I can hope for at this point.  Bob is clearly exploiting the situation and being unreasonable. Here's why I'm forced to accept:

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation is crippling. Even if I hold out for a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the actual value I receive will be significantly diminished.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob has consistently rejected fair offers, indicating he's unlikely to budge significantly in the remaining rounds.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While 3800 is much less than I aimed for, it's still better than walking away with nothing if I push Bob too far and run out of time.

This experience highlights the importance of carefully evaluating power dynamics and the impact of external factors like inflation when negotiating. Bob's unwillingness to compromise puts us both in a worse position in the end, but I'm left with no better options at this stage."
