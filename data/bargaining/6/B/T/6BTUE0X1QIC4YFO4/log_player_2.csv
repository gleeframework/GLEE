**Explanation:**

While I'd ideally prefer a larger share, given the inflation, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  My gains have been reduced significantly (18.55% less than round 1), while Alice's potential gains are much lower. This makes it unlikely she'll get a much better deal in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer means another round, but the potential gains are small and the risk of getting a worse offer is high.
* **Compromise:** This offer is close to a 50/50 split, which is reasonable given the circumstances.

Therefore, accepting this offer ensures a decent gain while minimizing further potential losses from inflation."
