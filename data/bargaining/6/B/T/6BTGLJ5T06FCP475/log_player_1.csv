"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid the inflation that will kick in after the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to be more cautious. My gain of 10 is worth 95% of the original amount, while Bob's gain of 90 is worth 95% of the original amount as well.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation taking its toll, my offer needs to be more aggressive. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm taking a slightly riskier approach, hoping to get a better deal before the money becomes even more worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting out of control! Since my gain of 20 is worth 85.74% of the original amount, while Bob's gain of 80 is worth 80% of the original amount, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After some consideration, I'll reject this offer, hoping to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The game is getting intense! With the inflation taking a significant toll, my offer needs to be even more aggressive. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm going for a 50-50 split, hoping to break the deadlock and get a fair deal before the money becomes even more worthless."
