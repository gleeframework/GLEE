"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's make it happen! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

For Round 1, I had offered 800,000, but due to 20% inflation, that's now worth 640,000 (80% of 800,000).
For Round 2, Bob's offer is 400,000 for me and 600,000 for him.

Considering the adjusted values, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Let's calculate the adjusted values:

For Round 1, I had offered 800,000, but due to 20% inflation, that's now worth 512,000 (80% of 640,000).
For Round 2, Bob's offer was 400,000 for me, but due to 20% inflation, that's now worth 320,000 (80% of 400,000).
For Round 3, I'll offer 450,000 for myself and 550,000 for Bob.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```"
