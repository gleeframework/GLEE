Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""My turn! How about a more even split? This offer won't be as good later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, you want a more even split? Fine, but I'm taking back some of what I gave you last round.  This is my final offer before inflation makes things worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the pressure of inflation against me, but she's losing value much faster than I am. While this offer is better than her first, I think I can still get a better deal if I hold out a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a split that benefits us both before inflation eats away at the value. This is a fair deal.""}"
