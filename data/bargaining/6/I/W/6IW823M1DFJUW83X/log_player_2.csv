Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to be reasonable, but I can't accept such a large disparity.  Let's try this split, it's the fairest I can offer right now. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45

```
Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is making significant concessions. Accepting this offer guarantees a decent gain before the value drops further for her and potentially leads to a worse deal for you.
