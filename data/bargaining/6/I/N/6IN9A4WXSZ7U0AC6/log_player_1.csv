"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a straightforward offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This way, we both get $500,000, and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather not give Bob a larger share, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation that has already occurred.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the lost value. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the increased inflation, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now. The money he's offering me is worth 5% less than in the first round, while the money I'd gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
