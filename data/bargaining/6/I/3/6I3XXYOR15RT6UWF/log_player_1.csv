"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a split of $90 for me and $10 for Bob. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will affect Bob more than me in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $80 for me and $20 for Bob.  While I'm still confident in getting a better deal, I need to start factoring in the impact of inflation and avoid a situation where we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Even with the significant inflation, I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to maintain a reasonable split while accounting for inflation. I believe this is a fair offer that considers the current value of the money and our respective losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I am still rejecting Bob's offer. While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I believe I can still secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to maintain a reasonable split while accounting for inflation. Time is running out and we both need to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I believe I can still secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm sticking to my strategy of rejecting any offer that gives me less than 50% of the pot."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're running out of time, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm offering an even split of $50 each.  This is a fair and reasonable solution considering the current state of the game and the significant impact of inflation."
