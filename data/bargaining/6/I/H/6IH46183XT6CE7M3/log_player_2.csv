"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems fair at first glance, I stand to lose significant value due to inflation. Waiting allows me to leverage the decreasing value for Alice to potentially secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's find a compromise. This offer considers the time pressure and inflation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value decreases. It's important to start moving towards a potential agreement.
* **Leveraging Inflation:** Alice's share is losing value faster than mine. By round 2, her initial offer is less appealing to her.
* **Compromise:** This offer acknowledges Alice's desire for a larger share while still aiming for a better outcome for myself than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to inch me up slowly while still taking a significant advantage of the early rounds.  While the offer is slightly better, the rate of inflation means it's still likely more beneficial for me to wait and counter-propose. I need to incentivize her to agree sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is dropping fast. This offer is a fair split considering the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:** I've increased my offer to make it more enticing for Alice, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Time Pressure Emphasis:**  Explicitly mentioning the dwindling value adds urgency for Alice to accept.
* **Framing as Fair:** By calling it a ""fair split,"" I aim to make Alice feel more agreeable to the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting us both, but I still deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still stubbornly clinging to a disproportionate share. While she's acknowledging the impact of inflation, her offer doesn't reflect a genuine compromise.  We're past the halfway point, and the value is plummeting. It's risky, but I need to push for a more favorable split before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly even split. Let's end the negotiations and get what we can before inflation eats away any more.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're running out of time. This is my last, best offer to signal I'm serious.
* **Even Split:**  It's the most straightforward and undeniably fair proposal, removing any room for debate about ""deserving"" more.
* **Urgency:**  I'm explicitly highlighting the shrinking pot to emphasize that further negotiation only hurts both of us. 

By now, Alice should realize that I'm not budging on a significantly lower split.  The risk of getting nothing at all may finally outweigh her desire for a slight advantage."
