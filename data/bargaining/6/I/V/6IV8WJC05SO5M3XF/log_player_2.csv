"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Don't let the money lose more value! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that inflation is eating into the potential gains, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  While a 50/50 split is no longer ideal, I need to hold out for a more equitable distribution before the value diminishes significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""The value is dropping fast. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient way to settle this now.""}"
