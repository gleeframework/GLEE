"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering you 20% of the initial $100, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping you'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 70 is a bit too generous. Let's see if you can do better. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my next move.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider 75, but I think I can do better than that. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping to get closer to the 80 I initially offered, but I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 75 is a fair share for me. Let's finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm sticking to my previous message and offering Bob 25% of the initial $100. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 60 is still a bit too high. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need a better offer. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less for me and significantly less for Bob, I'll have to be even more strategic with my next move.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept 60. I think I can do better than that. Can you meet me at 65?""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a higher share, but I'm still being cautious given the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 62.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 37.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway between 60 and 65. Let's see if this is acceptable to you.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, while also taking into account the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between 40 and 60. Let's see if this is acceptable to you. I think 50/50 is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less for me and even less for Bob, I'll have to be cautious with my next move.

However, a 50/50 split is a very reasonable offer, and considering the decreasing value of the money, it might be the best I can get. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
