Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the inflation rates and that we are both losing money with each round. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
