"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less in the second round, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 40 x 0.9 = 36
Bob gain: 60 x 0.9 = 54

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's still better than nothing. I'll accept this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
