"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money fairly this time. I think 60/40 is a good start.  You'll get more than I did in the last round, and we can start with a more equitable division. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
