Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking a big toll on your gain, this is a generous offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is not ideal, the inflation is taking a significant toll on my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's significantly less than the initial fair split."
