"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer gives me a comfortable share while still leaving you with a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit too skewed for my liking. I'm proposing a more balanced split. This ensures we both benefit substantially from this deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money! I've moved closer to your offer, let's seal the deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aware of the pressure from inflation on my end. While her offer has improved, it's still skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm willing to play the long game to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 425000,
""alice_gain"": 575000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to the middle. I'm demonstrating my commitment to finding a fair deal. Let's make this work.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Building:**  Each round that passes reduces the real value of the potential winnings for me due to inflation. It's crucial to keep the pressure on Alice.
* **Demonstrating Seriousness:**  A slight increase in my proposed share shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but won't simply cave.
* **Striving for Fairness:** While not ideal, this offer is getting closer to a truly equitable split, considering the time pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a fair split, and your stubbornness is costing us both money. Take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Bluffing:** Her claim of a ""fair split"" doesn't hold water. She's trying to use emotional manipulation by highlighting the impact of inflation, which only affects me.
* **Still Early:** We're only in round 5. While the inflation is hurting, I have some leverage to push for a better deal. 
* **Testing her resolve:** By continuing to reject, I want to see how much she's truly willing to compromise."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  We both know this 'fair split' rhetoric is just a tactic. I'm holding firm on a deal that reflects the value I bring. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Tactics:** I'm calling out Alice's bluff and using stronger language to signal my seriousness.  
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By declaring this my final offer, I'm putting pressure on her to make a decision now. This minimizes my inflation risk. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  While my proposed share is higher, I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller portion than my previous offer to increase the likelihood of Alice accepting before inflation further erodes my potential gains."
