"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a bit greedy last round, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob's trying to make a more generous offer this time!

I'll think about it... I'm not too keen on the 20-80 split, but I suppose it's better than nothing. And the money is worth less anyway, so I'll have to make the most of it.

I'll accept this offer.
