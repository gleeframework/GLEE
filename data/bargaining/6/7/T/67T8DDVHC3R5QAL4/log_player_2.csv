# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is now willing to accept the deal I offered in round 4.  This suggests I still have negotiating power. I'll continue to push for a slightly better outcome, knowing the longer we wait, the more desperate Alice will become."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a very reasonable offer considering the time constraints and the impact of inflation on your share. Let's be practical and finalize this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying pressure:** I'm slightly lowering my demand to show some movement but keeping it close to my previous offer. This keeps the pressure on Alice while still aiming for a favorable outcome for myself. 
* **Highlighting inflation:** Reminding Alice about inflation reinforces the idea that waiting is riskier for her than for me.
* **Seeking a resolution:**  We're getting close to the halfway point. While I'm confident I have the advantage, reaching a deal sooner rather than later minimizes risks."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm mirroring your previous offer. It's clear we need to settle this now, and this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now mirroring my offers, indicating she's feeling the heat. Accepting this offer ensures I get a favorable split while avoiding the risk of walking away with nothing if the negotiations drag on too long.  It's better to secure a win now than to gamble on a potentially insignificant gain in later rounds."
