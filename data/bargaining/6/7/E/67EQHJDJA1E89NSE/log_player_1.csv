Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the difference!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no need to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my share of $5000 is now worth $4000.

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob in the middle, as it seems like I'd be giving up a significant portion of my potential gain. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""Still a good starting point, but I'm willing to give you a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous, but still keep a significant share for myself."
