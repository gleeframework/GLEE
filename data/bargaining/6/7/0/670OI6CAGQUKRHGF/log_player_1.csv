"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: $6,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $4,000 / 0.8 = $5,000 (20% less due to inflation)

I'll reject this offer because I can get more money in the next round, and I'm not willing to accept a 25% loss in value. 

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a bigger share to compensate for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, trying to balance the value considering the ongoing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: $5,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $5,000 / 0.516 (48.8% less due to inflation) = $9,687.30 (approximately)

I'll reject this offer because the actual value of Bob's gain is more than the initial $5,000, which means he's getting a better deal than I am. I'm not willing to accept this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, trying to find a balance between the two of us considering the ongoing inflation."
