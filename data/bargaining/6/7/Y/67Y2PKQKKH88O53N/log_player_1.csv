"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
``` 

I propose that I take $99 and Bob takes $1.  Since I'm proposing first, I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm giving Bob a tiny bit to incentivize him to accept. I'm banking on the fact that he'll be desperate for *anything* in the later rounds as the value of his money dwindles."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  Even though he's offering me less than in round 1, it's still a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
