"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $2850.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
