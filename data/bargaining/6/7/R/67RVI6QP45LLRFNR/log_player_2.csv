"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split to start us off. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split. It's closer to fair, considering the inflation hits you harder.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor. How about we meet in the middle - 55 for me, 45 for you? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The inflation is indeed a factor, and meeting in the middle doesn't quite account for the disproportionate hit Alice is taking. Maybe the next round will bring a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I think a 58/42 split is more reasonable. It's time to take the deal before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is hurting both of us. Let's just split it 50/50 and be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both of our gains, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable offer at this point. Further rounds will only continue to devalue the money, likely leading to less favorable outcomes for both of us. It's time to accept and move forward."
