"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which is a relatively fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's a good deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is a more balanced approach. It's a little closer to even, and we can both still walk away with a substantial sum. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth $380,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth $570,000. Considering the inflation effect, I think a 6:4 split is a bit more favorable to Bob, but it's still a decent offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a 50-50 split is fair and simple""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even split than before. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
