"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a good starting point, but it's too early to accept.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal in the next round.  Let's see what Alice offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 
 
I'm offering Alice 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself.  It's a good starting point for negotiations.  We'll see if she takes it or if she wants to go back and forth a few more times."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still quite low.  Even with inflation, I can likely get a better deal if I keep playing. I'll reject and see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
 
I'm offering Alice a 50/50 split.  With inflation starting to bite, I think it's time to try and reach a compromise."
