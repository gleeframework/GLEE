Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the current situation, I think this is a generous offer. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is not ideal, with each round, the value of the money I get decreases significantly. It's better to accept the offer now than risk getting even less in the next round."
