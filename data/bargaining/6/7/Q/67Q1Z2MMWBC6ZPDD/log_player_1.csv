"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $60 is now worth $54.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll take it. His offer is a bit better than the initial one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
