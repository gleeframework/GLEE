"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

I propose a 990,000/10,000 split in my favor.  This ensures a significant gain for me, and while small, Bob still receives something.  This is a good starting point and demonstrates a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous offer, I am confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself. I am willing to compromise, but I will not accept an offer that gives me less than 800,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm offering an 850,000/150,000 split.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still ensures a large portion of the money for me while giving Bob a more substantial share than before.  I believe this offer demonstrates good faith and could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired outcome, I'm still not satisfied.  With each round, the value of his share is decreasing due to inflation, so I can afford to be patient.  I'm confident I can secure a deal with a higher payout for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering a 900,000/100,000 split.  This is a slight increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given the ongoing inflation that is affecting Bob's share.  This offer demonstrates my willingness to work towards a solution while still prioritizing a significant return for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally in the range I'm willing to accept. While it's not my ideal outcome, I recognize the value of getting a deal done before inflation further diminishes Bob's share and potentially jeopardizes the entire negotiation."
