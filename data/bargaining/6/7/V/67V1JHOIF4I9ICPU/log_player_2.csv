"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a more equitable split considering the inflation disparity. This offer benefits us both.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. While it might seem ""fair"" on the surface, the rapid inflation working against me makes it unacceptable.
* **My counter-offer:**  I'm aiming for a slightly advantageous split, understanding that Alice is also losing value with each round, but at a slower rate than me. 
* **The message:**  I'm framing the offer as mutually beneficial and highlighting the time pressure caused by inflation. This might encourage Alice to accept rather than risk further losses in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but her offer still doesn't fully account for the disparity in how inflation affects us. If I accept her proposal, I'll be losing a significant chunk of the initial value due to the rapid inflation working against me. It's worth risking another round to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We're both losing money here. This is my final offer. Take it before inflation eats away at it further.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** This is a crucial round. We're both feeling the pressure of inflation. I need to convey a sense of urgency.
* **Slight concession:** I'm slightly lowering my demand to show a willingness to compromise, but I'm holding firm on getting a larger share to offset the rapid inflation working against me. 
* **Finality:** By stating it's my final offer, I'm hoping Alice will recognize that further negotiation could lead to a worse outcome for both of us."
