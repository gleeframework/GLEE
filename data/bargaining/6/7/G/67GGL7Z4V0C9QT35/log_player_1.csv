Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a fairer split that takes into account the inflation we are both facing.  Let's get this settled before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
