90.0,10.0,"I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Let's start with a fair offer, but be aware that the money will be worth less with each round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a fairer split that takes into account the inflation we are both facing.  Let's get this settled before the money loses too much value.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,I'm willing to compromise.  A 60/40 split is fair given the inflation and the fact that I'll be making the next offer if you reject this one.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
