"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not giving away all the profit. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me $4,000, which is worth 80% of the original $5,000 I asked for in the first round, I'll have to decide whether it's worth proceeding or accepting this offer.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting a good deal if you don't take this now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings now.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a larger share, especially since my gain is worth significantly less due to inflation. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting even less.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
