"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll give you a fair chance to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair starting point and accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 50 is now worth 40% of the initial $100.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good one, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate further. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.
