Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but not too risky, split.  I'm sure we can find a better compromise down the line.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was quite imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by letting the money depreciate further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move a bit closer to your proposal, but I still think we can find a more balanced split that benefits us both. Let's aim for a 55/45 split in my favor. This acknowledges your risk, but also ensures we both get a decent share of the money before it depreciates further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
