"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 60/40! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not so generous after all, huh?

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,200 ($4,000 x 0.8).

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to accept this offer to move forward. I'll have to think strategically for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
