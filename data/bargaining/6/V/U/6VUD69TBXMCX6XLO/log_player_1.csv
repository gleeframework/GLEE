"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose to take 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars.  This is a fair starting point, as it accounts for the inflation that will affect Bob more heavily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've reduced my offer to account for inflation. Bob is likely to be more accepting of this deal with the increasing inflation affecting his gains more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is becoming increasingly impactful. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a significant portion of the money, and Bob is likely to accept as he is facing much higher inflation."
