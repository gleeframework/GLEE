"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm giving you a good chunk!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, but I'm also keeping in mind that the value of the money decreases with each round, so I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and not losing too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it closer to 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I think I can still get a better deal. The value of the money has decreased, but I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is the best I can get. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value!""}\n\nI'm taking into account the fact that the money is losing value with each round, so I'm trying to find a compromise that is closer to the original amount, but still gives Bob a significant share. I'm hoping that Bob will see the sense in settling on this split before the value decreases further."
