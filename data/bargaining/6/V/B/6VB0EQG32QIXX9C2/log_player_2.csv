Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation and Bob's previous offer, I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a reasonable disparity while acknowledging the risk of decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
