"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to try to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate too much 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll consider the value in terms of the original $10,000.

In this case, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if I want to accept it yet. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You said we should split it down the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of negotiating!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I'm referencing Bob's previous message to try to make my offer seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the value of the money has decreased by 48.8% since the first round, I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

In this case, Bob's offer is a 40/60 split, which is a significant shift in his favor. I'm not sure if I want to accept it, but I'm also not sure if I want to risk waiting for a better offer.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
