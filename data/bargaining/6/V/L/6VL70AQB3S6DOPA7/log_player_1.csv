"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a decent chunk of the money, but leaves Bob with a respectable amount as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less, which is $1200 less than in the first round. I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer since it's a 50/50 split, which doesn't take into account the inflation effect on my end.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to maximize my gain while leaving Bob with a reasonable amount. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share than before, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is taking a toll on my gains. With the money I gain in Round 4 being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be even more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I notice that he's proposing a 40/60 split, which is even more skewed towards his favor than the previous round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation effect continuing to erode my potential gains, I'll aim to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share than before, but still leaves Bob with a smaller amount. I'm hoping to capitalize on the inflation effect and secure a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is really taking its toll on my potential gains. With the money I gain in Round 6 being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 25/75 split, but I'm starting to think that I might need to accept a lower share to get a deal done. I'll accept Bob's offer.
