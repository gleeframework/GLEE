"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself!  The offer is not fair, considering the inflation that is going to happen in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, taking into account the potential for inflation. Let's be reasonable and get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think I need a larger share to break even. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though the offer is less than what I initially proposed, I'm still going to reject. The inflation has hit me harder, and while 3000 is better than nothing, I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I've considered your concerns about inflation, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's end this game with a reasonable split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation has eaten into Bob's offer, I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a bigger piece of the pie to compensate for the reduced value. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit painful, but it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. Inflation has hit my share hard, and any further rounds are likely to leave me with even less.  Time to take what I can get."
