Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very simple division, taking the majority of the money for myself (900,000) and giving Bob a smaller share (100,000). Since the money will be worth less in the next round, it makes sense for me to try and secure as much as possible now. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. In the next round, I would have to offer Bob even more to get him to accept, and the money would be worth less for me. It's better to take the 450,000 now while it's still worth something."
