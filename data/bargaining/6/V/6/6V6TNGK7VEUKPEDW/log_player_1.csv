"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
This offer is designed to be fair and to get the game started. It is likely Bob will accept it, as he is receiving something rather than nothing. If he rejects, I will adjust my offer in the next round to be more favorable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. While the inflation does slightly reduce the value of his gain, it's not enough to justify accepting this offer. I'll try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  This acknowledges the inflation that has occurred but still gives Bob a significant share of the money.  I believe this is a fair compromise that will encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my initial proposal, even with the inflation.  I believe I can still get a better deal, especially since the inflation is hitting him harder than it is me. I'll try to negotiate a fairer offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This round, I'm offering a 50/50 split. The inflation has made the money worth less for both of us, and I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest solution at this point.  This also avoids any further risk of rejection, which would only make things worse."
