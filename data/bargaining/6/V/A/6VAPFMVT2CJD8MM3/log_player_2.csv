Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm taking into account the inflation that affects both of us. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I believe my offer is reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think I can negotiate a better deal, despite the impact of inflation. I'll wait for the next round to make another offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I'm willing to compromise but still believe I deserve a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nAt this point, the money is worth significantly less for me than for Alice, so I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes this into account."
