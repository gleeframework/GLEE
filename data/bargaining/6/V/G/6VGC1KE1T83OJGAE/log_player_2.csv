Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 10$ for me and 90$ for her, and the money is worth 10% less for her each round, I'll try to make a more favorable offer. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 20, ""alice_gain"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for Alice each round, and now being worth 19% less than the original amount, her offer is not as good as it seems. I'll stick to my original plan and try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 15$ for me and 85$ for her, and the money is worth 19% less for her, I'll try to make a more favorable offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 25, ""alice_gain"": 75}"
