"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining 100k in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a good starting point for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a fair split, especially considering the rapid decrease in value. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to try to find a compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money."
