"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to keep things friendly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll start low, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 900,000$
* Bob's gain: 630,000$

I don't think this is a good deal for me, as Bob is taking a larger share than I initially offered. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much yet.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but still a relatively fair split. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
