Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth 5% less, I'll have to be careful.

I don't like the 40-60 split, as it's not as favorable to me as the 50-50 split I proposed earlier. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
