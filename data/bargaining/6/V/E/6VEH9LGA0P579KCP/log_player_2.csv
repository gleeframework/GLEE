"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority this round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take the majority this round. Next round, you can take the majority.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 split this round. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  Even though the money is worth less now, a 50-50 split is fair and it ensures I get something.  It's better than risking getting nothing at all if we continue to disagree."
