I'm proposing a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor. This is a fairly generous offer, considering the potential for inflation. I want to secure a large portion of the money while leaving Bob with something to consider. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is far less favorable than my initial proposal. Although the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gains, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 700,000/300,000 split. I'm willing to compromise slightly from my previous offer, but I still believe I can secure a majority of the money. This should be attractive to Bob, especially since he's already rejected my previous offer and the value of the money is shrinking with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. Inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, and while Bob's offer is less than ideal, it's still a substantial amount. Rejecting this offer might lead to an even worse deal in the next round, as the value continues to decrease. It's better to secure something than risk losing more."
