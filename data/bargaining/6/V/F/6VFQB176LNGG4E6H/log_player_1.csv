"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my gain accordingly. I'll calculate my gain in the new terms.

In the first round, I proposed a gain of $6000. Due to 20% inflation, my gain in the second round would be $6000 / 0.8 = $7500. 

Now, let's compare Bob's offer in the second round ($4000) to my adjusted gain ($7500). I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer based on the current value.

My current gain in the second round would be worth 80% of $7500, which is $6000. To adjust for the 20% inflation in the third round, I'll multiply $6000 by 0.8, which is $4800.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```"
