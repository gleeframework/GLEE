"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering him a smaller share. However, I'm not being too aggressive to try to reach an agreement quickly. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 60-40, with me getting the larger share. This will be fair as we both have to agree on the terms. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, his proposed 60-40 split in his favor is actually worse for me than it initially seems. Since the money loses 20% of its value for Bob with each round, his $6000 is effectively worth $4800 in terms of the original value. Meanwhile, my $4000 remains worth $4000. Given this, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, considering the inflation that affects Bob's gains. Since Bob's money loses 20% of its value each round, I'll try to find a balance that takes this into account.

### {""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more fair split.""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take $6500, leaving Bob with $3500. Given that Bob's money loses value over time, I believe this split is more favorable to him than it initially seems. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on, taking into account the effects of inflation. Let me know how Bob responds!"
