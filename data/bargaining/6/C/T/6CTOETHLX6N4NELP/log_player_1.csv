"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```
I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair share considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll have to accept a slightly lower amount due to the inflation. Since Bob's offer is closer to an even split, I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
