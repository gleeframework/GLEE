Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is still too much in your favor. Let's split it 60/40, and I'll take the smaller share. We both get something, and we avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is more reasonable, it's still too early to settle.  The inflation is hurting her more than me with each round.  I'll hold out for a better deal."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm tired of this back-and-forth. Let's be fair and split it 50/50. This is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation. It's better than us both getting nothing! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly better deal, the 50/50 split is now a reasonable compromise. The inflation is steadily eroding Alice's potential gains, making her more open to a fair deal. Accepting now guarantees a significant sum, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we continue to argue."
