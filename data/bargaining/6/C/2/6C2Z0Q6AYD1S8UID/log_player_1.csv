Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, knowing the money will lose value for me with each passing round.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. I propose a 55/45 split.  It's still in your interest to take this deal as the value decreases for you each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
