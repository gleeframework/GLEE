Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is technically in his favor due to the inflation heavily impacting his potential gains, accepting a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round that passes diminishes the value of the money for Bob.  While we want to maximize our gains, it's becoming less likely Bob will offer anything significantly better than a 50/50 split as the game continues.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer carries the risk that Bob might propose an even worse deal in later rounds. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount. 
* **Simplification:**  The longer the negotiation goes on, the more complex it becomes to calculate the ""real"" value of the offers due to the inflation factor. A 50/50 split is clean and understandable."
