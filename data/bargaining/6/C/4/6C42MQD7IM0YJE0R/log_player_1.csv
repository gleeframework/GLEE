Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince Bob has offered a 50/50 split, which seems like a genuinely fair offer, I'll accept it. This way, we can both walk away with $5000, and the game will end on a positive note."
