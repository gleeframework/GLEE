"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I think this is a fair split, and it's a good starting point for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about the offer.

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the fairest way, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to propose an alternative.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a different split. How about 550,000 for me and 450,000 for you?""
}
```

Your turn!"

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

}
```

Your turn!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit less this time, but I need to get a better deal than your last offer. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth significantly less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about the offer.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting a larger share, especially since the money is worth less overall. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that takes into account the changing values.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the increased share for Bob. How about 420,000 for me and 580,000 for you?""
