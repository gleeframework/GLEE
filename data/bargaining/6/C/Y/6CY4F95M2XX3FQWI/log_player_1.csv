"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new proposal.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and I initially proposed a 50-50 split, I'm now getting 50 * 0.95 = 47.5.

Comparing this to Bob's offer of 60, I'll decide to reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my money is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. Since I initially proposed a 50-50 split, I'm now getting 50 * 0.95 = 47.5.

I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of my money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52
}
```"
