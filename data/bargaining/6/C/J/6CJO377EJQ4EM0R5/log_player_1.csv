"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth $540,000, and the $400,000 I offered Bob is still worth $400,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a good deal for me, as I'm getting more money than I offered in the first round, adjusted for inflation. I'll accept this offer.
