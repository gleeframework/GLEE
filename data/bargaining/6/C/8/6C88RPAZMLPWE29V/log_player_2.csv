"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself.  Since the money is worth less to me with each round, I'm hoping I can get Alice to accept a better offer for me in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fair for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer a more even split, inflation is hitting me hard. Accepting this offer gives me some money and prevents me from losing more in the coming rounds."
