"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $600,000 and you'll get $400,000. What do you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 600000 and you can have 400000. Since I'm now making the offer, I'm keeping a bit more, but still leaving you a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment...

Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:
My gain: 400,000 x 0.9 = 360,000
Bob's gain: 600,000 x 0.9 = 540,000

Considering this, I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time. Take $580,000 and I'll keep $420,000. Your turn!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
