Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep 990,000 dollars for myself and give 10,000 dollars to Bob. This is a very generous offer considering the inflation.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing at all with further rounds of inflation."
