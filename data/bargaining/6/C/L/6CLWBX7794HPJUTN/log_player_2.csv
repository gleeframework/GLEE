Round 5

# Alice's message: You're losing value each round, I'm being generous here 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the shrinking pot against me, but I still have some leverage.  While her offer is incrementally better than before, it's not enough.  I need to show I'm willing to push this further down the line, hoping she'll concede a larger share to avoid getting nothing."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Each round you wait, your share loses more value. Take this deal 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on, but I can't fold yet. Alice is clearly employing a strategy of slow increases, hoping I'll crack. However, her latest offer is still significantly in her favor.  I need to hold out a little longer and see if I can get her closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Time is running out. This is my final offer to avoid both of us getting nothing.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** With only four rounds left, the pressure is on. I need to signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm slightly lowering my demand from the previous 48/52 split to show a willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to push Alice towards a decision. She risks getting nothing if we don't settle now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time and value, this is as good as it gets 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the wire. While this offer isn't ideal, rejecting it carries a significant risk. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** Only three rounds remain. If I reject this, even if Alice offers me an even split in the next round, the inflation will have eaten into it so much that it'll be worse than what I'm getting now.
* **Alice's Stance:** She's been firm, slowly increasing her offer, but never drastically. This offer is likely the best I'll get at this point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for one or two more dollars isn't worth the risk of getting nothing. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting this offer ensures I at least get something out of this game."
