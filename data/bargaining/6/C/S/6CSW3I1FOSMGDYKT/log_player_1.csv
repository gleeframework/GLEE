"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer, which doesn't take into account the inflation effect on my side.

I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round for Bob, and 10% less for me. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
