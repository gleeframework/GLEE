"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$, which is a decent amount, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this deal, it's a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the money is now worth less than in the previous round, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70% for him, I'll aim for a better split this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""This is a more balanced offer, don't you think?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to meet in the middle, huh? That's a good strategy, but I'm not sure if it's the best for me.

Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less than in the previous rounds, so I'll have to be cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this deal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer to my price, but I'm not there yet!""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, let's shake on it! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting closer to my target, but I'm not quite ready to shake on it yet.

Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less than in the previous rounds, so I'll have to be careful. However, Bob's offer is very close to my previous offer, so I'll consider it a good option.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 6.
