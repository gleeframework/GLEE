"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to be greedy and offer you a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty good deal, considering you could get nothing if we keep playing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept such a bad deal. Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, I know Bob will have to start offering me a better deal soon to avoid getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer a 70/30 split in my favor. It's still a good deal for me, but I'm giving Bob a chance to make some money too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With the inflation hitting, I'm better off accepting this 50/50 offer. Even though I'm getting less than my initial proposal, it's still a good deal, considering the possibility of getting nothing if we keep going."
