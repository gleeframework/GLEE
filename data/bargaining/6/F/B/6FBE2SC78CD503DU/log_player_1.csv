I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  Let's see if he bites!"

I reject Bob's offer. It's a terrible deal for me.  I'm sure I can get a better offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm going to try to get a bit more than Bob's last offer, but I still want to be reasonable.  This time I'm offering a 70/30 split, with myself getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000.  Let's see how he feels about that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer. While it's closer to 50/50, I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to hold out and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get a good deal. This time, I'm offering an 80/20 split, giving myself $800,000 and Bob $200,000. It's a better offer for him than the last two rounds, and I'm willing to give him a little more to hopefully end this game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 675000 
# Bob gain: 325000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting a bit scary. With each round, Bob's share is becoming worth less and less.  I'll accept this offer before it's too late. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing."
