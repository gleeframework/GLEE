"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  I'm taking a risk with this high offer, but I think it's better to secure a large amount now than risk losing more in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation and is trying to get a much larger share.  While I would gain some money, it's still a significantly smaller amount than my initial offer.  I'm going to risk it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share than before, but I'm still aiming for a majority.  Since the inflation is biting, I need to secure a sizable portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a better offer than the previous round and accept it."

Round 5

This is a compromise offer.  I'm aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to give Bob a significant portion to avoid further rounds and the risk of inflation. I hope this will be enough to convince him."

Although Bob's offer is slightly better than the previous one, it still feels like a bad deal considering the inflation. I'm going to reject and see if I can negotiate a better outcome in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the inflation. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, hoping I can avoid getting stuck with such a small share."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

This is a terrible deal.  Despite the inflation, I still feel like I can get a better share.  There are only two rounds left, so I'm going to risk it and try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This is my last chance to secure a good share. I know inflation is a major factor, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both losing a lot of money by continuing to play. I'm offering him a significant portion, but I need a majority to avoid ending with practically nothing."

{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough call. It's a very small amount of money, but it's better than nothing. The inflation has taken a huge bite out of the potential gains, and we're at the very last round. I'm accepting this offer to avoid losing everything completely."
