"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split, Bob. I take $6,000, you take $4,000.  It's in both our interests to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice. But I think I deserve a bit more.  Let's flip the script - I'll take $6,000, and you take $4,000. This way we can both get a good amount and avoid wasting time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, how about a compromise? I'll take a bit less than my first offer, you get a bit more. $5,500 for me, $4,500 for you. This seems fair considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take what I can get, especially with the inflation factor.  I'd rather secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
