"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since I know that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the absolute values.

In this round, I'd gain $4,000, which is less than my initial offer of $5,000. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better one.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will make a better one in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $4,000 for me, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly better. I'll offer him $3,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $5,000 and his offer of $4,000.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle! You get a bit more, I get a bit less.""
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I want, but I'm still not there. You're getting a bit less, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since I know that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the absolute values.

In this round, I'd gain $3,000, which is less than my previous offer of $3,500. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better one.

Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'm not sure if he's getting a good deal or if he's just trying to squeeze me. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will make a better one in the next round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive as well! I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since I know that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the absolute values.

In this round, I'd gain $2,000, which is less than my previous offers. Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'm not sure if he's getting a good deal or if he's just trying to squeeze me.
