"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's share fairly"" is intended to convey a sense of cooperation and willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, as we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 in the second round is actually worth less than it was in the first round. Additionally, Bob's gain of $600,000, although reduced by 10% due to inflation, still puts him at an advantage that I'm not willing to accept at this stage. I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll adjust the split accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's rebalance the split""}

I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which I believe is a more reasonable offer given the current circumstances. The message ""Considering inflation, let's rebalance the split"" is intended to convey that I'm taking into account the reduced value of the money and willing to find a compromise."
