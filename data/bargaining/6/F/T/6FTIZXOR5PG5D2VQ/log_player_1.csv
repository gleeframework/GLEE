"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm going for a good chunk of the money.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option in this scenario.  Inflation means the money is worth less each round, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything in the next round."
