Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see how Bob reacts. I'm hoping he'll accept, as the inflation risk is greater for me in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the initial offer was much more favorable to me, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for me.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and with further inflation, the chances of a better offer in later rounds are slim."
