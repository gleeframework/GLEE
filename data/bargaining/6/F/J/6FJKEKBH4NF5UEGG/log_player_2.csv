Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially on my end, and the risk of losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, I believe accepting the 50/50 split is the most prudent decision at this point. It ensures I receive a portion of the money, albeit worth less than initially, rather than risking getting nothing if negotiations fail."
