"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $700,000 is worth 80% of the original $800,000, which is $640,000. Bob's gain of $300,000 is worth 95% of the original $200,000, which is $285,000.

I'll accept this offer.
