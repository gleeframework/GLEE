"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent chunk. Let's see if he accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation kicking in, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I'll have to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it... 

I'll accept this offer.
