Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 80/20 is a more reasonable split. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I want to make sure I get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
