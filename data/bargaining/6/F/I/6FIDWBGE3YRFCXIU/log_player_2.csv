"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a good starting point for negotiation. While the offer is not ideal for Bob, it's wise to reject it and see what Alice counters with.  Bob can use the knowledge that Alice's money is losing value more slowly to potentially negotiate a better deal for himself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script, I'll take the larger share this round.  It's only fair, right?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, last chance before it devalues more 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer isn't ideal, it's important to consider the inflation.  Bob is losing a significant amount of value with each round, and Alice's offer is a decent compromise.  Taking this offer secures a reasonable gain for Bob, and further rounds might result in even less for him."
