6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000. This way we both benefit from ending the game quickly.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think a more balanced split would be better. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I also need to get a fair share. How about we split it 5500 for me, 4500 for you?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. How about we switch our previous offers? I get $5,500, and you get $4,500.  We both benefit from settling this now before inflation eats away at the value further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Let's try a more even split again. I'm willing to go up to 6000, but I need to see some flexibility from you as well.  Let's end this before we lose more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we're getting close, but this is taking too long! I'm willing to go down to $5,200, leaving you with $4,800. Let's agree on this and avoid further losses from inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I'm getting impatient too, Alice.  Let's move to a more equitable split. I'm offering 6500 for myself, which leaves 3500 for you. This is the last offer I'm making before the inflation really starts to hurt us both.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's be realistic and end this now. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it, but we're wasting valuable time.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. I'm sticking with my last offer - 7000 for me, 3000 for you. It's the best we can do before the inflation makes this pointless.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, listen carefully. We're down to the wire.  I'm offering you $5,200, more than I'm taking! This is incredibly generous considering the circumstances.  Accept this now, or we both lose out.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, I'm serious. We're down to the wire, and we're both losing money. My final offer is 7500 for me, 2500 for you.  It's time to stop being stubborn and take what we can.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, this is it. Last chance.  I'm taking a hit with $4,500, you get $5,500.  Agree now, or we both walk away with nothing. Don't be greedy, Bob.",Alice,11,
