"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 10% less, so the effective value of the $60 I'd get is $54.

I'm not sure I'm willing to compromise to Bob's tune just yet. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make a counteroffer. With the money worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve a better deal 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 27.1% less, so the effective value of the $55 I'd get is $40.15.

I'm starting to get a bit desperate too, but I still think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer and try to squeeze out a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's getting tougher to make ends meet with the inflation eating away at the value of the money. With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a better deal to make up for the inflation!""
