950000.0,50000.0,"Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives you a good chunk while ensuring I get the lion's share. Time is ticking and inflation hurts us both!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. I understand you want a larger share, but my offer reflects the impact of inflation on my end. 70/30 is fair considering the circumstances.",Bob,2,

850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, but your offer was too low. This is my compromise â€“ it accounts for inflation while still reflecting the value I bring to the table.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is it. We're down to the wire.  50/50 is the only fair outcome at this point.  Let's end this and both walk away with something rather than risk getting nothing.",Bob,8,
