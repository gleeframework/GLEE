"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, my gain of 50$ is worth 95% of the original 90$, which is 85.5$. Bob's gain of 50$ is worth 80% of the original 10$, which is 8$. This offer is better than my previous one, but I'd like to try to get more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain of 85.5$ is now worth 81.225$. I'll aim to get a bit more than that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the offer:

My gain of 70$ is worth 100 * 0.905 * 0.905 * 0.905 * 0.905 * 0.905 * 0.905 * 0.905 * 0.905 * 0.905 * 0.905 * 0.905 * 0.885 = 37.64$ (approximately)
Bob's gain of 30$ is worth 100 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.784 = 6.83$ (approximately)

This offer is not as good as my previous one, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept it.
