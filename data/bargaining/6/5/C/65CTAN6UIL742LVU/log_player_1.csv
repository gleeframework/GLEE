"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. My message to Bob is that I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, my $50 gain would be worth 80% of the original $60, which is $48. Bob's $50 gain would be worth 90% of the original $40, which is $36.

I'd like to reject this offer, as I'd be getting less than my original proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rates, the total value of the money is decreasing, so I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, my $55 gain would be worth 51.2% of the original $60, which is approximately $30.72. Bob's $55 gain would be worth 67.5% of the original $40, which is approximately $27.

I'd like to accept this offer, as it's a slightly better split for me than my original proposal, and it's closer to a 50/50 split than Bob's previous offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
