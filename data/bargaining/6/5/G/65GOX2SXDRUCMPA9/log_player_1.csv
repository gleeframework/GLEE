"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiation!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is in order. Let's try 55-45.  
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than the original $60, so my gain in this round is $60 * 0.95 = $57.

I'm not thrilled with the 45-55 split, but it's a more balanced proposal than the previous one. I'm willing to accept it, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds.
