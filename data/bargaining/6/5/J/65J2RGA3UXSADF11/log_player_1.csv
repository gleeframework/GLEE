"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, my gain of 40 is equivalent to 40 / 0.8 = 50 in the first round, which is a decent offer considering the initial proposal.

However, Bob's gain of 60 is still 20% more than his initial offer, which seems a bit unfair.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% less than the previous round), I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think 45 is still too low 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money I gain is now worth significantly less due to inflation. To calculate my gain in the first round, I'll divide 45 by 0.5208 (1 - 0.478 = 0.522, then 1/0.522 = 1.916, then 45 / 1.916 = 23.46). This means I'd be getting approximately $23.46 in the first round, which is a decent offer considering the inflation.

However, Bob's gain of 55 is still worth the same as in the first round, which seems a bit unfair.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 60.8% less now (20% less in each of the previous three rounds), I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 32.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 67.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need something more substantial in return!""
