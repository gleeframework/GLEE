I'm going to be greedy and keep most of the money! ðŸ˜‰ I figure Bob might accept a small amount since he doesn't know about the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the $1000, I'm betting on the inflation effect impacting Bob more in the next round. I'll try to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still going for a large share, but I'm offering Bob a bit more this time, hoping that the inflation is making him a bit more eager to settle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While it's a lot less than I wanted initially, the inflation is hitting Bob harder than I anticipated. I don't want to risk getting nothing in the next round."
