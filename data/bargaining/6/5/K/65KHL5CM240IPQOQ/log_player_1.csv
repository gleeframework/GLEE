"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. I think this is a fair offer since Bob is the one making the proposal next round, and will have the advantage due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more money, accepting this offer is the best strategy. If I reject, I will have to make the offer next round, and Bob will have the advantage of the inflation.  I'm better off taking the 100,000 now and accepting a loss than risking a much worse outcome in the next round."
