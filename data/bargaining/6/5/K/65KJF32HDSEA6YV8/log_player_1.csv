"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with a 75/25 split in favor of you, Bob. This might seem like a good deal considering the potential loss due to inflation in future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I understand the threat of inflation, I believe this is a fairer division, especially since we're both taking a risk by continuing the game. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
