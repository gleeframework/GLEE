"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get a small piece now, but I'm hoping we can reach a better deal later on. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to accept a small gain, it's important to remember that inflation will significantly impact the value of the money in later rounds. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make a proposal in the next round, potentially securing a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest option, and we both get a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this offer is significantly better than the first one, it's still not a good deal considering the potential for a larger share in the future.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a proposal again and potentially secure a larger portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share than the previous offer, but I still need a significant portion to make this worthwhile for me. Let's try to find a compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, Bob.  This is my final offer.  If you reject it, we risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's message suggests urgency, it's important to remember that Bob has already rejected better offers. The inflation is significant, but there are still rounds left. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make a proposal in the next round and potentially get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the end, and the pressure is on. I'm willing to offer you a fair share, but I need to secure enough to make this worthwhile for me too.  This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to give you a larger share, but we both need to compromise if we want to get anything at all. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the time is running out and Alice is offering a larger share, Bob should still reject this offer. The inflation is significant, and there are still a few rounds left. Bob can still make a proposal in the next round and potentially secure a better deal. He should try to negotiate a larger share for himself before agreeing to a deal that leaves him with a significantly smaller portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're nearing the end. This is my final offer.  I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to secure enough for myself to make this worthwhile.  Let's come to an agreement before we risk losing everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking!  We're both losing money with each round.  This is my best offer, let's make a deal before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the pressure is high and Alice is pushing for a deal, Bob should still reject this offer. Even though the inflation is significant, there are still a few rounds left, and Bob can still try to negotiate a better deal for himself. Accepting this offer would leave him with a significantly smaller share of the money, and it's worth risking a few more rounds to try and secure a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Alice, we are running out of time. This is my final offer. I need to secure a large enough share for myself to make this worthwhile, but I am willing to give you something. We need to come to an agreement now or we risk losing everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it.  We're both losing a lot of money with each round.  Let's split the remaining amount evenly, or we'll both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a crucial moment. Despite the significant inflation impacting Bob's gains, accepting this offer is the best choice. Here's why:

* **High Risk of Losing Everything:**  With only one round left, rejecting Alice's offer means both players risk losing all the money. There's no guarantee Bob can secure a better deal in the final round.
* **Significant Inflation:** Bob's gains are already severely diminished by inflation. Even a larger share in the final round may not compensate for the substantial losses already incurred.
* **Fair Split:** The offer proposes an even split, which is a fair compromise considering the circumstances.

While Bob might have hoped for more, accepting this offer secures a significant amount of money for him, preventing a total loss."
