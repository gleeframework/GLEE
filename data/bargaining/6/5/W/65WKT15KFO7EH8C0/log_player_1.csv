"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 90% and leave you 10% to start. You can do better, right?""
}
```

I'm starting with a strong offer, leaving Bob with a relatively small share. Let's see if he accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 55%, you take 45%. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less, but I still want to negotiate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept 45% of the reduced amount. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70% now, but I'm willing to compromise. You can try to do better!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to 60%, but I don't think we can go much higher. Let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is trying to end the game. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept 40% of the reduced amount. I think I can do better, especially since the game is still in its early stages. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth less and less, but I'm still optimistic. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up yet. You can do better, right?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
