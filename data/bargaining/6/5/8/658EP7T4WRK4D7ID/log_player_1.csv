"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking $900,000 and Bob taking $100,000.  I'm hoping this is a fair enough offer that he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although the initial offer seemed better, considering the inflation rate, accepting this offer is a better deal for me. In the next round, I might not get anything, and this guarantees a smaller portion of the money."
