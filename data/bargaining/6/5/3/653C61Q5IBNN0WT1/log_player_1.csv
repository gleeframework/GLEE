"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively generous starting offer, considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more equitable. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: 400,000 (which is worth 20% less than 500,000, the amount I would have gotten in the first round)
* Bob gain: 600,000 (which is worth 10% less than 666,667, the amount he would have gotten in the first round)

Considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer is actually a bit more generous than it seems at first glance.

However, I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is the most equitable. I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sold on the 60/40 split. Let's try something else""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle with a 55/45 split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob has changed his mind and now agrees with my previous offer!

Considering the inflation adjustment, the money is worth significantly less now. Here are the actual values:

* Alice gain: 450,000 (which is worth 54.5% less than 1,000,000, not 48.8% less, I made a calculation error)
* Bob gain: 550,000 (which is worth 17.7% less than 666,667, not 27.1% less, I made another calculation error)

Despite the errors, I think Bob's offer is a good one, and I'd rather accept it than risk going to the next round. I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
