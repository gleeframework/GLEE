"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but willing to negotiate!""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and leaves $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it a bit more evenly. I think we can both do better than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's worth $5,700. Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's worth $3,200.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to get a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, my gain of $5,700 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's worth $5,415. Bob's gain of $3,200 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's worth $2,560.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```"
