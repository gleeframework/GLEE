"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, giving myself 90% and Bob only 10%. This is to test the waters and see how much Bob is willing to accept.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option at this point.  Inflation means I'm losing money with each round, and if I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I'll get anything close to this in the next round."
