"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the bigger share""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I take 80% of the money and Bob takes 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 2:3, a fair and balanced deal 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping to get a better deal, considering I was initially willing to give him 20% of the money. I'll try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you still need to compromise""}

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which is a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, but still favors me slightly. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer this time. The inflation has reduced the value of the money, and I'm not getting any younger. I'll take the 68% share and hope that Bob is happy with his 32% share."
