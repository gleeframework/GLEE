"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to meet me in the middle!

I'm not sure if this is the best deal, considering the inflation. But I'm willing to consider it. Let me think for a moment...

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
