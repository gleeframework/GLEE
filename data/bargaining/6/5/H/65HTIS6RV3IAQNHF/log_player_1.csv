"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm curious to see what Bob will say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his offer of $6,000 is actually equivalent to $4,800 in the first round, which is still a bit more than my proposed $4,000.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit more than mine, I'll try to negotiate a better deal by offering a smaller amount to Bob. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. Your turn again!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze the offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, his offer of $5,200 is actually equivalent to $10,000 in the first round, which is a lot more than my proposed $4,800.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite generous, I'll try to take a firmer stance and offer a smaller amount to him. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, Bob. You'll have to do better than that!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze the offer. Since the money is worth 67.23% less for Bob, his offer of $4,600 is actually equivalent to $14,000 in the first round, which is still a lot more than my proposed $6,000.

However, I'm getting closer to my goal, and I don't want to risk going too low. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can get an even better deal in future rounds.
