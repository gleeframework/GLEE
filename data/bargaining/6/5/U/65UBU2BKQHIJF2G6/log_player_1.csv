"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (900,000$), leaving Bob with a smaller share (100,000$). It seems like a good starting point, as I have the first advantage due to the inflation rate being more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer gives me a decent amount (150,000$), the inflation rate has a much bigger impact on me. I'm losing 20% of the value of my gains every round, so I need to ensure a much higher share to compensate for that. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try and push for a bigger share again. Since I'm losing 20% of my gains every round, I need to ensure a larger portion to make the deal worthwhile.  I'm offering Bob 200,000, which is still a significant amount, but it allows me to keep the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still losing value much faster than Bob.  Although 100,000 is something, I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm aiming for a significant share to compensate for the substantial loss of value due to inflation. By offering Bob 300,000, I hope to secure a deal that still gives me a majority while acknowledging his diminishing returns."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is still significant, the inflation rate is hurting me tremendously.  My gain is worth less than 33% of the original value. I'm going to reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm trying to secure a decent share while acknowledging the increasing impact of inflation on both of us.  Offering Bob 400,000 might be enough to incentivize him to accept. I'm losing a lot of value each round, so I need to get a deal done before the inflation eats away at my gains even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is incredibly unfair to me.  While Bob is barely affected by the inflation, my share is worth less than 20% of its original value. It's a lose-lose situation for me at this point. I will reject this offer and hope for a better outcome, even if it means we end the game with no deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a risky move, but I'm at a point where the inflation is significantly affecting me. I'm offering an equal split to Bob, hoping he'll recognize that the value of his gains is diminishing less rapidly than mine. This could be our best chance for a deal before the game ends with neither of us getting anything."
