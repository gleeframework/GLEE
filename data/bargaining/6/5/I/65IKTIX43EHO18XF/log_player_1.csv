"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Consider that inflation hurts you far more than me. This is a generous offer given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
