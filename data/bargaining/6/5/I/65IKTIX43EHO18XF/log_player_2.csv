"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.  It's a good starting point for us to build on! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for Bob! While it might seem ""fair"" in the sense of being a round number percentage, Alice is getting the vast majority of the money. Bob can definitely negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Consider that inflation hurts you far more than me. This is a generous offer given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand inflation impacts us differently. However,  a 50/50 split seems fair given your previous offer.  Let's compromise and see if we can reach an agreement before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is now much more reasonable. A 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the time pressure and the fact that Alice is hurt more by inflation.  It's better to take a sure win than risk getting nothing."
