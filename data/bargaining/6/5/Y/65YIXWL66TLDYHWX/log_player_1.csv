Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that leaves us both with a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my original offer, the inflation makes accepting this offer the best option.  I'll get 45% of the money, which is still a decent amount, and rejecting could lead to even less in the future rounds."
