"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference to test the waters!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly! I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I don't want to give up too much, but I also don't want to risk going into the next round with less money. Considering the inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
