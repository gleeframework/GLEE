"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the most equitable way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% reduction in value, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split. It's a fair and reasonable starting point, and I'm willing to compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
