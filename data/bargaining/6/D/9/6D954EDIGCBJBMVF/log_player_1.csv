"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing this as a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round, but I'm open to adjusting the split if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my potential gain of $40 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $36.

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 40/60 split, but I'm open to discussing further. Can we meet in the middle at 45/55?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my potential gain is now worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90% = 81%), which is approximately $32.40.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's aim for a 50/50 split, and we can both walk away with a fair share.""
}
```"
