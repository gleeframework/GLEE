Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's a tough start.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Inflation is hurting you more each round, so a fair deal now is better than risking it all later."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand inflation is working against me.  But I'm not giving up that easily. Let's split it 50/50, fair and square.  We both get a good chunk, and we can avoid further risk. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
