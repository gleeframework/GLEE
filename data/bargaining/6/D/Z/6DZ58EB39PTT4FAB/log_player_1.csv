"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going for a big chunk in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid any potential loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. Although I would prefer to get more, it's better to get something than risk getting nothing. With each round, the amount I get will decrease, and it's likely that Bob will propose even less favorable offers in the future."
