"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you get $30. It's best to settle now before inflation eats away at your share. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd rather take the risk of losing some value to inflation than accept a deal that gives me only 30% of the total amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly. I get 60, you get 40. Inflation is coming, so don't wait!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is hitting you hard! I'll be generous - I'll take $65, leaving you with $35.  It's better than what you'll get next round! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not convinced that accepting $35 now is better than taking the risk of inflation further reducing my share. I'll hold out for a better deal, even if it means going to the next round.\n\n###\nAlso, Alice's ""generous"" offer is still quite lopsided in her favor, and I suspect she's trying to take advantage of the inflation pressure on me. I won't fall for that tactic.\n\n###\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if Alice is willing to make a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I know inflation is eating away at my share, but I'm not desperate yet! Let's meet in the middle - 55 for me, 45 for you. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. I'm offering you $40.  Inflation has already taken a bite, and it'll only get worse for you. Take this deal before you lose even more! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I think accepting $40 now is a better option than risking further reduction in the next round. While it's not an ideal split, I've managed to get Alice to increase her offer from the initial $30, so I'll take this as a reasonable compromise.\n\n###\nIt's time to end the game and walk away with what I can get."
