60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We can adjust in the next round if you think it's not fair.,Alice,1,

30.0,70.0,"Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about we try a 70/30 split this time?  Consider that the value of the money decreases faster for you than for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45.  This takes into account the inflation rates and allows us both to get a decent share.,Alice,3,
