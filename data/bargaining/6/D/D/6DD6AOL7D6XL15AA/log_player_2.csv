Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 99, you get 1. You can choose to accept or reject. If you reject, you get to make the next proposal, but remember, inflation will make our money less valuable in the next round!

# Alice gain: 99

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids the risk of inflation affecting our shares in the future.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your desire for fairness, but 50/50 is not sustainable. The money is losing value. Let's stick with my initial offer, but I'll reduce my share to 98 to show good faith. Accept this, or we risk losing more money in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 2 
# Alice gain: 98
