Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking further inflation."

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your money is losing value fast, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is being ruthless and the inflation is eating into my potential gains. Accepting a 38/62 split is far from ideal, but it's better than risking even less in future rounds if Alice refuses to budge."
