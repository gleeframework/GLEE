"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic ultimatum game scenario.  I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it rather than risk getting nothing in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm taking this offer. I'm aware of the inflation, and if I reject this offer, I'm not guaranteed to get anything in the next rounds. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
