"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since we're playing with inflation, it's important to secure a larger share early on.  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
