"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting the offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the loss in value. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, and 25% less than in round 1. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to account for the decrease in value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get a larger share as the rounds go on. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Wait a minute... this offer is exactly the same as his previous offer in round 2! Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'd rather not accept this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 5, the money is worth 31.25% less than in round 1. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for an even larger share to account for the decrease in value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me. Considering the inflation, I'd rather aim for an even larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is very close to my previous offer in round 5, but with a slightly better share for me. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After reconsidering, I'll accept this offer.
