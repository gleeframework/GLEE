"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. I figure this is a good starting point, as it leaves him with a decent share while still giving me the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is still significantly better than what I'd get if we keep rejecting and the inflation continues.  It's also worth noting that Bob's offer is much more equitable than my initial offer, which may indicate a willingness to negotiate."
