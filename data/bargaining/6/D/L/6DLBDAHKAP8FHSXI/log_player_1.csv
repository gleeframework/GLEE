"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```
This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll think carefully... With this offer, I'll get $200,000, which is worth 95% of what I could have gotten in the first round, but Bob will get $800,000, which is worth 80% of what I could have gotten in the first round.

I'll reject this offer. It's not a good deal for me.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 90% of what it was in Round 1.

Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```
This way, I'll get 70% of the current value of the money, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Let me calculate the value of the offer in terms of the original money...

400,000 is worth 40% of the original $1,000,000, and 600,000 is worth 60% of the original $1,000,000.

I'll think carefully... This is a pretty good deal for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

I'll accept this offer.
