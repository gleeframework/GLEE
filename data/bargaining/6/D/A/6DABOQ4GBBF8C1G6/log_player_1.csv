"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping to secure a large portion early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to secure something, the inflation is too significant. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a more balanced offer than my first one, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous attempt to get the majority. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm getting a little more than in the last round, the inflation is rapidly decreasing the value of the money. I'm hoping to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a more aggressive offer than the last one, acknowledging the growing inflation.  I believe it's a fair compromise given the decreasing value of the money. Let's see if Bob will accept."
