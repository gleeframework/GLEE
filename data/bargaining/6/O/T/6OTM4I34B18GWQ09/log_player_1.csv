Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair-ish deal. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent amount to start with. We can always negotiate later.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more equitable split. This ensures we both benefit significantly.  Don't let time (and inflation!) diminish our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
