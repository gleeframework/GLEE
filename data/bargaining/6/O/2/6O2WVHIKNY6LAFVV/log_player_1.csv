"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values, I'll consider Bob's offer. I'd rather not accept a smaller share, so I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself this time, hoping Bob will accept."
