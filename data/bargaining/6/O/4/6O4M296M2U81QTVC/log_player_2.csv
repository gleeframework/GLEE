{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. Time is money, and we both lose value with each passing round. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a strong offer that allows us both to walk away with something substantial. Take it while it's still on the table!""}
