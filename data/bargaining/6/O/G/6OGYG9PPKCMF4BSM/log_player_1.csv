Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's end this on a fair note. A 50/50 split is the most logical solution.  
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is now the best I'm likely to get. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob's share is decreasing in value with each round, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal. However, my gains are not affected by inflation.
* **Time:** The longer the game goes on, the more Bob loses due to inflation, but the less likely he is to accept an offer heavily skewed in my favor.
* **Risk:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will propose an even worse deal in the next round, putting me in a weaker bargaining position.

A 50/50 split is fair and ensures I don't risk losing out on a significant sum due to Bob's decreasing returns."
