"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\nI'll start by offering a slightly uneven split, favoring myself with $55 and giving Bob $45. The message ""Let's split fairly!"" aims to convey a sense of compromise and reasonableness, encouraging Bob to accept this initial offer and avoid further rounds where the value of the money decreases for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer of an even split. Given that the value of the money remains the same for me but decreases for Bob with each round, I have an incentive to hold out for a better deal. Since we're only in Round 2 and there are 10 more rounds to go, I'm willing to risk proceeding to try and get a more favorable split, knowing that the pressure of inflation is more on Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I will slightly adjust my initial offer to make it more appealing to Bob, while still taking advantage of the fact that the money's value hasn't decreased for me. Given the pressure of inflation on Bob, I'm hoping he'll be more inclined to accept a deal that's still favorable to me but better than his previous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway on fairness""}\n\nI've reduced my share by $2 from the initial offer, increasing Bob's share in the hopes that this gesture towards his concept of fairness, combined with the looming threat of further inflation, will persuade him to accept this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but we need to reach an agreement before the inflation hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer again, as I still believe I can negotiate a better deal given the circumstances. Bob's offer of $48 for me is less than what I've previously been willing to settle for, and since the value of the money hasn't decreased for me, I don't feel the same urgency to accept a less favorable split. The fact that Bob is now offering me less than what I previously proposed suggests he might be willing to compromise further as the rounds progress and the impact of inflation on his potential gain increases.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer than before, acknowledging Bob's increasing urgency due to inflation, but still aiming to maximize my gain. Since Bob was willing to give me a slight edge in his last offer, I'll try to capitalize on that willingness while also appearing to compromise.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Recognizing your concerns, let's find a middle ground""}\n\nI'm reducing my share by $1 from my previous offer and increasing Bob's share, hoping that this gesture, combined with the pressure of inflation, will encourage Bob to accept this deal and end the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting me more, so I'm going to have to ask for a slightly larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's compromise and avoid losing more money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer again, as he's now asking for a larger share than I've been willing to accept. Given that the value of the money remains unchanged for me, I don't feel pressured to accept a deal that's increasingly unfavorable to me, especially since Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping that Bob's growing urgency will eventually lead him to accept a more favorable split for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll maintain a firm stance, given that the inflationary pressure is mounting on Bob. Since he's now asked for a larger share, I'll counter by offering a split that's slightly less favorable to him than my previous offers, but still appears reasonable considering the circumstances.

{""alice_gain"": 54, ""bob_gain"": 46, ""message"": ""Considering the situation, this is a fair adjustment""}\n\nI'm increasing my share by $2 from my last offer, decreasing Bob's share, and framing it as a fair adjustment given the ongoing negotiations and the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain. This approach aims to take advantage of Bob's growing urgency while still presenting the offer as a compromise."
