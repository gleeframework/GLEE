"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob.  This seems fair since I'm the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I would prefer more money, the inflation is going to hit me harder if I continue rejecting offers and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
