"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gains, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still looking for a fair split. Bob's offer is a bit skewed towards his side, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60-40, and my goal is to get a fair share, I'll try to make an offer that's slightly more favorable to myself, considering the inflation factor.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gains even more severely, I'll have to adjust my expectations. The 52% gain for Bob seems relatively high, considering the reduced value of money. However, I'll consider it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
