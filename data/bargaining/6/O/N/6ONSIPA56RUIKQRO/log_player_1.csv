"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself. I've included a message suggesting that this is a fair split, in the hopes that Bob will accept and we can end the game here. Since the value of the money decreases with each round, I want to try to end the game as quickly as possible to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair deal.  You'll be getting a smaller share, but that's because the money is worth less to you in this round.  It's a better offer than what you gave me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less to me in this round, I'm not willing to accept a smaller share than what I offered Bob in the previous round. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round, hoping to get a better deal. Since the value of the money decreases more for me than for Bob, I want to try to end the game as quickly as possible, but I'm not willing to settle for what I consider an unfair split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $450,000 and taking $550,000 for myself. I've included a message indicating that I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I should receive a larger share. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as the value of the money will continue to decrease in subsequent rounds. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and ending the game quickly to minimize the impact of inflation on my gain."
