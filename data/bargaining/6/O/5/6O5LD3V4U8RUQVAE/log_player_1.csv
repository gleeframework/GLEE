"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 400,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 600,000. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob's offer is the same as mine from the first round, but with the adjusted values due to inflation. I'll reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

I'm offering you 460,000 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 540,000. Let's see if you'll accept this time!"
