I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it quickly.  I'll take the lion's share, since I know the money will be worth less in later rounds. Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although I get less than I hoped for, it's still a significant amount. I'm not sure how inflation is affecting Bob, but I don't want to risk getting nothing at all if we keep going."
