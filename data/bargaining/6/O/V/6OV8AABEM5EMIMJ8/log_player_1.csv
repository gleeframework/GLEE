"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 2k and let's split the rest 80/20""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me getting the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 4k, you take the rest 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I don't like the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'd rather get a larger share now than risk waiting for a better offer. I'll accept this offer.
