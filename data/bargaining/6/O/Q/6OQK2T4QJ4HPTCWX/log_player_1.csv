"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how the negotiations go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll offer you a slight discount, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4000 * 0.8 = $3200.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I was hoping for a better share. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.
