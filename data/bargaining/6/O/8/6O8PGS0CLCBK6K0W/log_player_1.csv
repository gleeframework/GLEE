Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a little better than an even split.  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'll need to keep more for myself as the money loses value each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
