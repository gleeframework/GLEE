Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair starting point and accept the deal."

# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I now have a total of 0.95 x 800,000 = 760,000 dollars.
