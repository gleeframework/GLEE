"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair share, let's start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'd like to see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I like that Bob is willing to meet in the middle and try again. The new proposal is 50-50, which seems more balanced. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I think this is a good compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer!"
