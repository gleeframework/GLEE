"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure a good chunk of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than my first offer, it's still not ideal, and I believe I can do better. Inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a fairer split. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% this round, slightly less than his previous offer.  I'm hoping that the threat of inflation will encourage him to be more flexible in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is starting to hit hard. While I'd prefer a more even split, Bob's offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  Accepting ensures I get something, and it's better than risking getting nothing."
