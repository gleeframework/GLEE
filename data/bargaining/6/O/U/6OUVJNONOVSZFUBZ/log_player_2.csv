"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm feeling generous, so I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting a 10% share. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split, considering the inflation risk.""}\n\n###\nI'm hoping Alice will see the sense in a more even division, given that the money's value decreases with each round. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 60% this time, since you rejected my last offer. I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting 40% of the money when its value has decreased by 36% already. I'll take my chances in the next round. Hopefully, Alice will be more willing to compromise as the money's value continues to drop."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I still believe I deserve a slightly larger share for taking on the risk of further inflation.""}\n\n###\nI'm trying to find a balance between being fair and considering the decreasing value of the money. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer before the money loses even more value."
