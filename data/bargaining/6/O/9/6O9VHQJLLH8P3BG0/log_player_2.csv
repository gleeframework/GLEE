"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, you take 40.  We can adjust later if needed. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I believe I can get a better deal. Plus, the inflation isn't a significant concern at this point, so I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round. \n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is now worth 20% less due to inflation, the effective amount is $80. I'll propose a division that is slightly more favorable to me, considering the decrease in value.\n###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's divide the effective $80. I'll take 55, you take 45. It's a fair adjustment.""}"
