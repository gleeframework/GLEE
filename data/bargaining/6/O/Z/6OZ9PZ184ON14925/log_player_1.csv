Even though Bob is framing this as a good deal, it's important to remember the inflation heavily favors me. While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, accepting it now means I'm missing out on potential gains as the value of Bob's share decreases with each round."

Bob is feeling the pressure from the inflation, but I need to hold firm. His share will continue to decrease in value, making my position stronger in upcoming rounds."

This is a tough one, but it's time to accept.  Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and while I might be able to push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two, there's a real risk he'll panic and offer a much smaller amount, or the deal will become worthless due to inflation. 70/30 is a good split in my favor, and it's better to walk away with a significant gain now than risk ending up with nothing."
