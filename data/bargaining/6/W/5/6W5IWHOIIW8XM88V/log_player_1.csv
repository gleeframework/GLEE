"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still considering the value of the money in terms of the original $10,000.

However, considering the offer is slightly more favorable to me than the previous one, and Bob is trying to be reasonable, I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
