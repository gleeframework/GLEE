I propose to take 990,000 dollars and give Bob 10,000.  I'm going to be greedy and try to get the most I can on the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I reject this offer. While I am losing value on the money due to inflation, I am still willing to hold out for a better deal. I'm not going to give up 990,000 dollars just because Bob is being greedy.  I'm sure we can find a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split.  With the inflation, I'm not going to be able to get close to my initial 990,000, so I'm willing to compromise.  I think a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get something worthwhile."
