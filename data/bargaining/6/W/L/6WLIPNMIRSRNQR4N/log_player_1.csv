"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem generous, but remember, the value of money decreases with each round due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 51/49 split.  This is a fair division considering the diminishing value of money with each round.  Let's end the game and avoid further potential losses. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
