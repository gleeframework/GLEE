"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'll reject the offer.  While it's tempting to take the initial offer, I know there's a lot of money on the table and I can potentially get a better deal. The inflation will hurt Alice more than me, so I'll see if I can negotiate something more favorable in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a more balanced split.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still like to get a larger share, accepting this offer is the most reasonable choice. The inflation is starting to bite, and Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate. I can get a decent amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
