"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a straightforward one, suggesting a 4:1 ratio in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting us!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it 50/50 just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're closer to 50/50, but I'd like to keep a slight edge""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, trying to nudge the ratio a bit more in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not comfortable with the imbalance 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think the ratio is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to split the remaining $10,000 in a 2:3 ratio."
