Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
 
While not ideal, accepting is the most logical choice at this point. Let me explain:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is losing value quickly, especially for Alice. This makes her more likely to accept a less favorable deal as the game progresses.
* **Round 4 Risk:** If I reject, in the next round I'll need to offer Alice a more appealing deal than this *and* account for another round of inflation on my own earnings. That's a risky gamble.
* **Present Value:**  A slightly smaller share now is better than holding out for a potentially larger share that's significantly devalued by inflation.

It's a tough decision, but taking the guaranteed amount at this stage is a safer strategy."
