75.0,25.0,I propose we split the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This is to ensure fairness considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
10.0,90.0,I propose we take a more even split this time.  I'll take 90% and you can keep 10%. This way we both get something and avoid the inflation penalty.,Bob,2,
