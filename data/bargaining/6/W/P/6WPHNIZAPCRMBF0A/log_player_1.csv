"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I think a 50/50 split is the most reasonable way to divide the money.  Accept this and we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
