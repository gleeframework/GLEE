Let's see if Alice is willing to accept a more equitable split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is worse than her first offer for me, and it's only getting worse with inflation. Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

Let's try a 50/50 split.  It's fair, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in avoiding further rounds and potential inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting worse for me with each round, and it's not even worth what she initially offered.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to stick with a higher split for myself, but I'm willing to offer a slightly lower amount to Alice to see if she'll accept it. The inflation is working in my favor, and she's losing more with each round."
