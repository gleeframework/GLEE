I'm going to try to maximize my share by offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll take it to avoid further rounds and potential inflation.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'm not thrilled with getting only $1000, it's better than nothing.  Bob's offer is a significant improvement over the previous round.  Considering the inflation, it's likely that any further rounds could result in even less money for me.  I'll accept and take what I can get."
