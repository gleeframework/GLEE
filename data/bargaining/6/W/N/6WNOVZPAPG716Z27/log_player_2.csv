"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share.  Let's see if you're serious about a deal. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still too skewed in her favor. The inflation is hurting her more than it's hurting me, so I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
