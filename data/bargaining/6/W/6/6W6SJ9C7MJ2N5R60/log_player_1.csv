"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
