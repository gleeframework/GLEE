Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller cut, but don't think I'll go much lower 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is lowering her demand, the inflation is working heavily against me. It's time to push for a more significant gain on my next turn, otherwise, the value of the money will shrink drastically."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer - a perfectly even split. Take it before inflation eats away at the value any further.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The increasing inflation rate makes each round significantly worse for me than Alice. While I want a better split, it's too risky to continue pushing for more. A 50/50 split is fair and gives Alice a strong incentive to accept now before the deal potentially gets worse for her."
