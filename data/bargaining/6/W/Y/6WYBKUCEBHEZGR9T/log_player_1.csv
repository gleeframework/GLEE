"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not sure it's the best we can do. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as enthusiastic about the offer as I was initially. However, meeting in the middle does seem like a reasonable compromise.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
