"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a fair offer, remember that in the next round, Bob will be the one making the proposal. By rejecting, Bob can potentially get a better deal for himself, especially considering the inflation that will occur in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This is a fair deal for both of us.  We both get a decent share and can move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should accept before it's worth even less 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though Alice is trying to pressure Bob, it's still not a good deal for him. Bob should continue to reject offers and aim for a better deal. The inflation is a significant factor that needs to be accounted for."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but this offer is the best I can do considering the inflation.  It's time to finalize this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating away your share, accept now 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers. While Alice is trying to pressure him, Bob still has a slight advantage in the next round where he will be making the proposal again. The inflation is significant, but Bob can still try to push for a more favorable deal for himself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  The inflation is hurting me significantly, so I need to get a better share.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, accept this or lose more 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While it's painful to accept such a small share, Bob's options are limited. The inflation has drastically reduced the value of his gains, making it unlikely he can get a better deal in the next round. Accepting now minimizes the losses."
