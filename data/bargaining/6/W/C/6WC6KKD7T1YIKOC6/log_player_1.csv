I'm going for a very high offer for myself, leaving Bob with just $1. I figure this will be rejected, but it sets the stage for me to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd love to get more, a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable offer.  It's better than getting nothing in the end!"
