"Round 1

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're losing value, but I'm not going to accept a deal where I get less than half. This is a fair compromise, considering the inflation affecting us both. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, any more rounds and the deal will be worse for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. I'm not budging any further. We're both losing money with each passing round. It's time to be reasonable and agree to a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of Bob's potential gain is rapidly decreasing each round. Waiting any longer will result in an even worse deal for him.
* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has made it clear she won't accept less than 60.  
* **Something is Better than Nothing:** Rejecting this offer means Bob risks walking away with nothing if Alice refuses to negotiate further in the next round.

While not ideal, accepting the current offer ensures Bob at least receives something, even if it's significantly reduced due to the inflation mechanic."
