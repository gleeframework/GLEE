"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a fair deal and that we can both walk away with a good amount of money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less in this round, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or later. I'm not willing to settle for 45% of the money, especially since I made a more generous offer in the first round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a slightly more conservative offer than in the first round, taking into account the 20% decrease in value from the first round and the 20% decrease from the second round. I'll offer Bob 50% of the original amount, but since the money is worth less now, the actual value is lower.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more than fair deal. Let's end this before the money is worth nothing.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds!"
