"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 90,
""bob_gain"": 10,
""message"": ""I'm proposing I take $90 and you take $10.  It's best to agree now, as the value of the money will decrease with each round."" 
}
```
 
This offer is designed to be heavily in Alice's favor, taking advantage of the time pressure created by the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more equitable split. Let's each take $60. This way we both get a good amount of money, and we can avoid the decreasing value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer sounds generous, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing for me, Alice, with every round. Accepting $40 now (after inflation) is worse than potentially getting a better deal in the next round. Bob is clearly trying to use the inflation mechanic to his advantage. 

I need to counter with an offer that still gives me a significant advantage but might tempt Bob enough to avoid further devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. You know time is against me. I'm offering you $30 which is still a good chunk of the pot.  Let's wrap this up."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  I need to keep Bob aware that the clock is ticking, and each round makes the deal worse for me.
* **Significant but Declining Advantage:** Offering $70 to myself is still better than accepting Bob's previous $40, even after another round of inflation.
* **Appearance of Compromise:** Framing the offer as ""realistic"" and highlighting that $30 is still a decent sum might make Bob more inclined to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
