"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, the money I gain is worth 5000 dollars, and the money Bob gains is worth 5000 * 0.8 = 4000 dollars.

I'll accept this offer.
