"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll get the majority, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased for me, but Bob's offer is still a decent one.

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
