"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get it over with, Bob. I'll take the whole thing.""
}
```

I'm starting strong with a bold proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'll take 90% and you can have the rest. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","A more reasonable proposal from Bob this time!

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 90% just yet. I want to keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again! 

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. I'll give you 40, and we can call it a day.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm still aiming to get a decent chunk of the cash!"
