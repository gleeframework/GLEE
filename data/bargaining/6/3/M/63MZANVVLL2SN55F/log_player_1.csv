"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55/45, it's a better deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **Inflation is hurting me more:** Every round that passes, my potential earnings decrease more than Bob's. It's in my best interest to settle this sooner rather than later.
* **Bob's offer isn't tempting enough:** While his offer is a bit better than the previous round in terms of pure dollar amounts, it's still heavily skewed in his favor considering the inflation disparity. 

I need to incentivize Bob to accept a deal in the next round with an offer that benefits him more, but still gets me a reasonable share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Time is running out! This is a better split for you than before, and it benefits us both to settle before inflation eats away at the value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but prioritize myself:** I've increased Bob's potential gain by $100 from his offer, making it more attractive. 
* **Highlight the time pressure:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that each passing round diminishes the overall value, making a quick agreement beneficial for both of us.
* **Aim for a deal:** This offer is still favorable to me, but the hope is that the combined factors (increased gain, time pressure) will push Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, my offer is better than the last one. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is trying to pressure me:** He's right that inflation is impacting me more, but he's using it as leverage to offer me a worse deal than before. 
* **I need to hold firm:** Accepting this would set a bad precedent. Bob might continue lowballing, assuming I'll crack under inflation pressure.

It's getting riskier, but I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair share."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is a fair deal, Bob. Accepting now means we both walk away with something substantial. Don't let greed make us both losers.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession, but firm stance:**  I've lowered my offer slightly from the last round, showing a willingness to negotiate but maintaining a position that values my share.
* **Appeal to logic and risk:** My message highlights the shared risk of losing everything if we don't reach an agreement soon.
* **Final push for a reasonable outcome:** This offer is still in my favor, considering the faster inflation working against me. I'm hoping Bob sees it as a reasonable compromise before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share, considering the inflation is affecting your gain more. This might be the last reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is playing mind games:**  His message is designed to sound generous while offering me the worst deal yet. He's trying to use the pressure of time and inflation to mask his attempt to secure a significantly larger share. 
* **I need to call his bluff:** Accepting this would be a mistake.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob has more to lose than me if we reach a stalemate. 

It's a gamble, but I need to show Bob I won't be bullied into a bad deal.  He needs to start making genuine concessions if he wants to reach an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""We're running out of time, Bob. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution.  Let's end this before we both lose out."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time for a strong stand:** With less than half the rounds remaining, I need to make my position clear.  
* **50/50 is the fairest:**  Given the circumstances, an even split is the most justifiable outcome.
* **Finality:** This offer isn't a negotiation tactic; it's meant to be my final word. Bob needs to understand that my priority is a fair deal, and I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
