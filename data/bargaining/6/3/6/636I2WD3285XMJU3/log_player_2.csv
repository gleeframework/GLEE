**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of the money decreases for her. While her offer isn't terrible, I'm still holding out for a larger share.  I'm hoping my ""final offer"" message in Round 4 will push her to make a more significant concession in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm standing firm. Take it or leave it, Alice.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my previous offer. I want Alice to understand I'm serious and won't budge much. The pressure of the shrinking pot should work in my favor now."
