"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm thinking a 65-35 split is more fair. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is a fairer split. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I think Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation factor. It's a good compromise, and I'd rather secure a significant portion of the money than risk getting nothing at all."
