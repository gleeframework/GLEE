Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find some common ground. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a good share to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is budging, but very slowly.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, so I need to push for a more significant split before we run out of rounds."
