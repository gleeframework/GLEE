Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will be happy with a small share, especially since the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While it's a much worse deal than my initial offer, it's still better than nothing. With inflation, getting even 100,000 is better than waiting for another round and likely getting less."
