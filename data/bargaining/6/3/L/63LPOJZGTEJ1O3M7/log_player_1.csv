"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was a good starting point, but the inflation disadvantage isn't as steep as you might think. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This ensures we both benefit from reaching an agreement early while acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
