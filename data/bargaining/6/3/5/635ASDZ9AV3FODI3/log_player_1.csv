Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly. Let's both get closer to 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're losing money quickly! Let's split it down the middle and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's tempting to hold out for more, but Bob is finally agreeing to a 50/50 split. Given the rapid inflation, especially for Bob, this is a good deal. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, whereas further negotiation risks significant losses for both of us.
