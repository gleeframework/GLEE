Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with something.  I want to see if he'll accept this offer or if he wants to try for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While my share is significantly less than the previous round, I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is making each round riskier, and a 50/50 split guarantees me something, even if it's less than my initial proposal."
