"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, a fair and simple beginning!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to offer you 40% of the money, which is a fair starting point considering inflation could affect the value of the money later. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as I would only get 40% of the total amount, which is a significant decrease from the initial 50/50 split. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep a decent amount for myself. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.""}

I'm trying to find a balance between keeping some of the initial 50/50 split and giving in to the effects of inflation."
