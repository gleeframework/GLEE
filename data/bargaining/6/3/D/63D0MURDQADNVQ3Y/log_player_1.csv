I'm proposing to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. I believe this is a fair initial offer, as it gives Bob a decent amount while ensuring a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, and taking 600,000 for myself. This is a compromise from my first offer, acknowledging Bob's rejection of his initial proposal. I hope this will be a fair offer that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing an even split of 500,000 dollars each.  With the inflation, the value of the money has dropped significantly. An even split seems like the fairest way to divide the remaining funds."
