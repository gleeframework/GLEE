"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more, huh?

I'm not willing to give up 200,000$ to Bob, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too low for me. I'll think of a new offer.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 55% is fair.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 460k, but I think I deserve more, considering the value of money has decreased 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still a bit low, considering the decreasing value of money. I'm willing to make a counteroffer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think 46% is the maximum I'm willing to give.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will budge!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing, so I'll try to make a more generous offer to compensate for that. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think this is the maximum I'm willing to give.""
}
