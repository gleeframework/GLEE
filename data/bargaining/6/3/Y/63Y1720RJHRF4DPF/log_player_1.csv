"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is my first offer. I'm trying to get the majority of the money, but still offering a small amount to Bob to incentivize him to accept. I'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While I'm losing a lot of money, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Bob's offer is too low, and there are still many rounds left.  I'm confident I can do better."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. I'm still trying to maximize my gains, but recognizing that I need to offer something more substantial to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the inflation affecting him.  I'm going to keep rejecting and see if he's willing to budge more.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to get closer to a compromise.  This is a significant amount for Bob, especially with the inflation working against him. I'm still aiming for a majority, but need to be more realistic about the potential for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but I'm going to accept. Bob is being stubborn and we are getting closer to the end.  An even split is a reasonable compromise, especially considering how much inflation is impacting Bob. I'm not sure I can do better at this point."
