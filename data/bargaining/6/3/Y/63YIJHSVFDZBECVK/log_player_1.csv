"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm thinking of taking the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. My message is a hint that I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness. Let's split the money equally. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $400,000.

I accept the offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'm willing to split the money equally, as Bob suggested."
