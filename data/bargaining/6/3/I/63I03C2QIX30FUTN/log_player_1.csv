"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I was hoping to get a better deal, but I don't want to wait too long and risk losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
