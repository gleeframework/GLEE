I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I am the one taking the risk of being rejected and having to wait for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm reducing my share to 70% in hopes of reaching an agreement.  I believe this is still a fair split considering the increased inflation rate."
