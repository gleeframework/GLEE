"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer ensures that Alice gets the majority of the money, with a significant advantage. It also leaves room for potential negotiation in future rounds, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This offer is still heavily in Alice's favor, but it acknowledges Bob's rejection of the previous round. It's important to consider the inflation rates and how much further the money can be diluted with each passing round. By offering a slightly lower percentage, Alice could potentially incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

This offer attempts to find a middle ground. While it is still advantageous to Alice, it offers a more significant share to Bob than the previous rounds. This could be seen as a compromise, acknowledging the increasing inflation and Bob's previous rejections. It's a gamble to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer continues to decrease Alice's share while significantly increasing Bob's, approaching a more equitable split.  The inflation is now quite substantial, so Alice needs to be more flexible to avoid ending up with nothing.  This offer might appeal to Bob as it represents a significant improvement from the previous rounds."
