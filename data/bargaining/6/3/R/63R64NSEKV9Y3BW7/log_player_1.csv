"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll have to think carefully about it. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to make up for the lost value due to inflation. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more after rejecting your previous offer""}

I'm hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise and accept a slightly more uneven split this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money worth 48.8% less than the initial amount, I'll have to be even more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's still a bit too generous for him, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer, hoping that we can get closer to a fair split in future rounds.
