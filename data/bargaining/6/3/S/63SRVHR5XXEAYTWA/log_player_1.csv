"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep the majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm trying to increase my share by 500 dollars, while still giving Bob a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit more desperate. However, I still don't want to give up too much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further, but I'll have to be careful not to give away too much more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The pressure is on! With the money I gain being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit anxious, but I'll give you a slightly better deal""
}
```

I'm trying to increase my share by 1000 dollars, but I'm not giving up too much more."
