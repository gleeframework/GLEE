"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60:40 split is fairer.  We can both get a decent amount and avoid the risk of inflation eroding our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
