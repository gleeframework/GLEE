Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for you. This offer is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
