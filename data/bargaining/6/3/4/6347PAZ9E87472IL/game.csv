75.0,25.0,I propose dividing the $100 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This might seem like a fair deal considering the first mover advantage.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
60.0,40.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split. It's still a decent deal for you, and I get a bit more than the initial offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
