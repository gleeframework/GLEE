I'm going for a risky strategy here!  I'm offering Bob $1, hoping he'll be tempted to take it quickly.  If he rejects, the money will be worth less to me in the next round, and I'll have to offer him more.  But, I figure he might be willing to take a small gain and be done with it. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's time to be practical. With inflation biting into my gains, a 50/50 split is a much better deal than risking another round and getting even less.  Let's call it a day."
