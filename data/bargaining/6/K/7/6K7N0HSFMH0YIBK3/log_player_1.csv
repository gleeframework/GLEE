"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $100 with an 80/20 split in favor of maximizing my share. This is fair given the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more fair.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more equitable way to start, and we can both benefit from the diminishing returns in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
