"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you a fair 10% of the total amount. Accept and we can both walk away with a nice chunk of change!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping he'll accept this generous offer and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money 90/10, with me taking the larger share.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to flip the script!

I'll reject his offer since I'd be getting only $100,000, which is 10% of the current $1,000,000, but it's worth 5% less due to inflation, making it even less appealing.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer, hoping to do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take a smaller share, but I still think this is a fair deal. Accept and let's move on!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time.  Let's make a deal and avoid any further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on me!

Considering the offer, I'd be getting $200,000, which is worth 14.26% less than the initial $1,000,000. That's a significant reduction. I'm not sure if it's worth accepting, especially since Bob's share is still quite large.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more aggressive now. I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise. Don't wait too long, inflation is eating away at our potential earnings!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my previous offer.  Let's reach a compromise and avoid any further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the offer, I'd be getting $300,000, which is worth 22.62% less than the initial $1,000,000. That's a significant reduction. I'm not sure if it's worth accepting, especially since Bob's share is still quite large.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer, hoping to get a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm still trying to be reasonable. I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is the last chance for a decent deal. Don't wait too long, the clock is ticking!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a 60/40 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be sensible and split the money 60/40 in my favor. It's a fair compromise and the best chance we have of getting a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is mirroring my previous offer!

Considering the offer, I'd be getting $400,000, which is worth 30.17% less than the initial $1,000,000. That's a significant reduction. However, it's also the same offer I made in round 7, and I'm starting to think that Bob might be trying to trick me into accepting the same deal.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to go 50/50, but only if you agree to it now. I'm not getting any younger, and inflation is eating away at our potential earnings. Let's split it down the middle and call it a day!""
}
```

I'm making a bold move by suggesting a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will finally accept a fair deal."
