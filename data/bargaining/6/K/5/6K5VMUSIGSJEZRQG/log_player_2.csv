Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to give you 40% - that's a big chunk of the money. I think we're both starting to lose out on value with each round. Let's call it a day and get this settled. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting anxious, which is good. While I am losing value due to inflation, I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting 40% now is better than nothing, but I believe I can still negotiate for a larger share in the remaining rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. 55/45 is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we are running out of rounds.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** With only 7 rounds left, the pressure is mounting. Alice knows I'm losing money due to inflation, so she might be more inclined to accept a less favorable deal than before. 
* **Strong stance:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I project confidence and urgency, hoping to sway Alice into accepting.  
* **Compromise (slightly):** While still aiming high, I've reduced my demand slightly from the previous 60/40 offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still seeking a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle and split it 55/45. We're losing money with each round, so let's make a deal before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but it's time to cut my losses. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer this drags on, the less my share is worth.  A 45% share now is better than risking a lower offer later and losing even more to inflation. 
* **Alice is firm:** She countered my ""final offer"" with a near mirror image, signaling she's unlikely to budge much more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for more is a gamble. I might get lucky, but the potential losses from a failed negotiation now outweigh the potential gains from a slightly better deal in later rounds."
