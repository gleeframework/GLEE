Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering Bob $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $3,600.
