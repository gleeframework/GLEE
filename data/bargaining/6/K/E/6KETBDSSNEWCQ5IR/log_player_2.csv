"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I still need to secure a good portion since the money is losing value quickly.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is moving towards a more even split, which is good. However, time is also working against me (Bob).  I need to push for a better deal in the next round while it's still possible to secure a significant gain."
