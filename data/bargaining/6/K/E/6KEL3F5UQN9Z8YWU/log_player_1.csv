"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is less than my initial proposal, I'll accept it.  There's a risk of the offer getting worse with each round due to inflation, and 85 dollars is still a good chunk of the pie."
