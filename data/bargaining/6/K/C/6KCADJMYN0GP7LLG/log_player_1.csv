Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want 600k for myself. It's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 400k is a fair compromise for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll hold out for a better offer."

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I'm still looking for a fair split. Your turn!""

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is significantly better than my previous one, and I'm not willing to settle for a 48.8% decrease in value for my share. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm starting to feel the pinch.

```

I think I've been holding out for too long, and this offer is as good as it's going to get. I'll take the 520,000 and call it a day."
