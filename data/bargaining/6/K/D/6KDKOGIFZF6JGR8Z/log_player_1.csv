"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair starting point, let's see if Bob agrees!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a fair share, even with the compromise. I was hoping for a better split, especially since my money is still worth the same as in the first round. I'd like to make a counteroffer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's try again!""}

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 25%. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm thinking...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and Bob's offer is getting more appealing. 80% of the initial $100 is a significant amount, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the current value of the money. I'm willing to take the deal and end the game."
