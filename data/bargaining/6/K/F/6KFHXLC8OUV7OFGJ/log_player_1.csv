"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share and can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation. Let's move forward and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than I expected. I'll accept his proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
