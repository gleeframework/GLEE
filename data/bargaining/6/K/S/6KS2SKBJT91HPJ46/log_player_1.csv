"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, I'm inclined to accept this offer. The 55% for Bob is actually a relatively good deal considering the decreased value of his share.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
