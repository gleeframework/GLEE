"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large share early on before the inflation kicks in. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing value with each round, so is Bob, albeit at a slower rate. I still have a lot of leverage in this negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm willing to concede a bit to avoid further rounds of negotiation. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly pushing for a larger share, but I'm still not willing to settle for such a small amount. I'm holding out for a better deal, even though the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains.  I'll see if he's willing to come closer to my offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, so I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding onto a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will realize that the longer we wait, the less value we'll both have."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is starting to close the gap, his offer is still far from equitable considering the impact of inflation.  I'm willing to take the risk of another round and see if he's willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm still aiming for a decent share, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation and the limited number of rounds left.  I'm hoping Bob recognizes that continuing to reject offers will hurt both of us in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not willing to settle for such a small share. With only a few rounds left, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing, and I'm still hoping to secure a larger portion.  I'll see if he's willing to increase his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds remaining, and inflation dramatically impacting the value of the money, I'm proposing an even split. I believe this is the most reasonable option to ensure both of us get something.  It's time to be pragmatic and secure a fair deal."
