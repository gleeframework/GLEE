"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given that we're both taking a risk.  Accept and we can finish this game. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the 10% decrease in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is fair, especially since I'm already losing value due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. A 50-50 split is fair, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced proposal."
