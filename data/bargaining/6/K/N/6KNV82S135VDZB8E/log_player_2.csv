"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. This back and forth is pointless with inflation eating away at our potential gains. I propose a simple 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but the deal won't get any better. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
