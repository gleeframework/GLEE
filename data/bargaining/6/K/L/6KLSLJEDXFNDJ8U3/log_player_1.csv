Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, as it gives us both a decent amount. Let's be reasonable, and let's get this done before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
