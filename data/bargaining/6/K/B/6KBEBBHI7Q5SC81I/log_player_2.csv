"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $90 for me. I'll make a new offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $81.60 for me. I'll consider Alice's offer.

Since Alice's offer is 60, which is less than the 81.60 I would get if I were to divide the money in proportion to the original 100, I will reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 29% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $71.10 for me. I'll make a new offer.
