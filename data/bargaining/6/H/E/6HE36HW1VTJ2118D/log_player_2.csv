"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! This offer is a good starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
Let's see what happens if I push for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting hard, and it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing in the next round."
