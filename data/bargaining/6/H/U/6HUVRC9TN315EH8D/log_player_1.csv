"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 

I propose a 990,000/10,000 split. I figure it's a fair starting point, leaving a lot of room for negotiation if Bob decides to reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, taking 500,000 now is better than risking getting less in the next round due to inflation."
