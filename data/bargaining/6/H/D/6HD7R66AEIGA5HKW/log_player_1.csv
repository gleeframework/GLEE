"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a split of 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob. This is a generous offer considering the inflation. I believe it's in both our best interests to agree to this in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is higher than the previous round, it's still not a fair deal. I will reject this offer and hope to get a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'm offering a split of 850,000 for me and 150,000 for Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still believe this is a fair offer given the inflation and the fact that I have to propose again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, I still won't accept this offer. I'm not sure Bob is understanding the impact of inflation on me. This is getting closer to a fair split, but I believe I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but I'm also running out of time.  I need to secure a decent amount before the inflation hits too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer seems to be stuck in the same range. Even though inflation is hitting me hard, I'm not willing to settle for such a low share.  I need to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer one more time to 750,000 for me and 250,000 for Bob.  Inflation is taking a serious toll, but I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value of settling before we both lose even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting a bit scary with the inflation.  Bob's offer isn't ideal, but it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.  I'll accept and try to be happy with 500,000."
