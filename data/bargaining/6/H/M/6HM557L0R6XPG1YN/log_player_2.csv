"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept an even split.  I know that with each round, the money is worth less to Alice.  I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the diminishing value of the money for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than 40%. How about 55/45?  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I still believe I can get a better deal.  Alice is getting a better deal with each passing round, and she's now willing to negotiate.  I'm going to stick with my 60/40 proposal for now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""My offer from round 2 still stands.  60/40 is the fairest split, considering the inflation rate.  I'm happy to negotiate further, but I won't go lower than 60%.""}
