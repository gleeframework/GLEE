"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start off fair, Bob. 60/40 split? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal. While a 60/40 split seems somewhat fair initially, I'm willing to bet Alice values the money decreasing at a slower rate than my own."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but the split isn't quite fair considering the inflation. How about we try a 55/45 split in your favor?""
}
``` 

Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This offer still leans in her favor but acknowledges the impact of the differing inflation rates."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still fair considering the inflation. We are both losing money by dragging this out. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to hold onto her initial offer, but it's getting worse for me with each round.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share, or she'll think she can stall me out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the only fair option here.  We both lose with each passing round.""
}
``` 

This is a strong move.  I'm putting the pressure on with a firm, but fair offer. It emphasizes the time pressure and the fact that her stalling tactics are hurting us both."
