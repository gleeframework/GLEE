This is a tough decision, but given the rate of inflation, it's not worth it to accept such a drastic reduction in my share. I'll keep fighting for a fairer division."

This is getting ridiculous!  Bob is taking advantage of the inflation, and I'm not going to let him get away with it.  I'm going to keep fighting for a fairer split, even if it means losing some money."

I refuse to accept this offer. Bob is being completely unreasonable! Even though the inflation is hitting me hard, I won't let him take advantage of me.  I will continue to negotiate for a more equitable split, even if it means both of us getting nothing."

The inflation is making this very difficult, but I'm still trying to offer a reasonable split. I'm hoping Bob will see that we both need to compromise to get anything at all. Let's reach a solution before the money becomes completely worthless!"

We're running out of time!  I'm increasing my share again, but it's the last offer I can make. I'm hoping that Bob understands the urgency of the situation and finally agrees to a reasonable split before we both lose everything."
