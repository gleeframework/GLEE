"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000 and take $6000 for myself. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he declines!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. You can't expect me to give you more than 20%. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so my gain of $2000 is actually worth $1900.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so my gain is worth 5% less than $1900, which is $1805.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take $2500 and leave you with $7500. It's a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
