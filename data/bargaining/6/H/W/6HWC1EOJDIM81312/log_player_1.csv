This offer gives me a larger share, but it's still a reasonable split considering Bob's money will depreciate faster."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm proposing an even split.  Since the money is depreciating faster for Bob, this should be a good deal for him, and it's still a decent amount for me even with the inflation."
