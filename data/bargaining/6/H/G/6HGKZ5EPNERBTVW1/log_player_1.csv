"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept.  This gives me the majority, but it's still a significant amount for him. Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my original offer, even accounting for inflation. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm going to increase my share a bit from my first offer, but still offer a decent amount to Bob. Since he rejected my previous offer, I'm hoping this will be more appealing, especially with the inflation factor."

Round 4

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse. I'm starting to worry about how much he's losing due to inflation, but I still think I can get a better deal if I keep rejecting."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to keep raising my share, but this time I'll only increase it by $500. I'm starting to think Bob might be stubborn, and I don't want to risk him rejecting the offer and getting less in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going back to my original offer.  Bob is clearly being stubborn, but I think this might be the best deal he'll get at this point. With inflation, his share is likely to be even less in the next round."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9500, ""bob_gain"": 500}
```

I'm going to go for a very aggressive offer, since we're running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that if he keeps rejecting, he'll end up with nothing, and he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is absurd.  I'm not going to accept it. Even with inflation, I'm not going to give up nearly all of the money. I'm better off getting nothing than accepting this offer."
