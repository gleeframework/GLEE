"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 100k, I'll take the rest. We can negotiate further if you like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 60/40 split in my favor this time. It's closer to what you offered, and with inflation hitting us both, we need to be more reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more balanced split, accepting this offer would still give her a significantly larger share. Given the inflation rate working against me, I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking and that clock is costing us both money. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a compromise, and it reflects the urgency of the situation."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. We're both losing money with each round, so a 50/50 split is the fairest option now. We can get nothing if we keep going like this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is finally offering an even split. While I was holding out for a slightly larger share, the impact of inflation is becoming too significant to ignore. Accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing to negotiate risks a complete loss."
