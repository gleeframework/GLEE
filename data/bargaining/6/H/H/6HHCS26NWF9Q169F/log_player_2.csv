# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than 50/50. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, don't you?""}\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll try to get a bit more than half to make up for the loss in value. Hopefully, Alice will see it my way!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need at least $55 to make this worthwhile.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with getting less than half, especially since the money is worth almost 10% less to me now. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round, even though the value of the money will decrease further. Fingers crossed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, Alice! The money is losing value fast for me. Can't we just meet in the middle... of what I want?""}\n\nAt this point, the money is worth 14.5% less to me than in the first round. I'll try to get a bit more aggressive with my offer to make up for the loss in value. Hopefully, Alice will be willing to compromise and accept this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  The longer we wait, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, the money is worth almost 20% less to me than in the first round, and Alice's offer is starting to look more reasonable. I don't think I can get a better deal, and if I reject this offer, the value of the money will decrease even further. I'll just have to swallow my pride and accept this offer. Hopefully, Alice was telling the truth and this is indeed her final offer!"
