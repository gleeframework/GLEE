"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. Since Bob's offer is not as favorable to me as the previous one, and the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed in my favor, but still leaves Bob with a decent share."
