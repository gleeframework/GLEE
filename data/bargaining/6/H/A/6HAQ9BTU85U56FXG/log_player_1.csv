Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000

Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of 900,000$ is still worth 900,000$, but Bob's share of 100,000$ is now worth 95,000$.

Bob's new offer of 400,000$ is a significant decrease from his initial 600,000$ in the first round, and I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.
