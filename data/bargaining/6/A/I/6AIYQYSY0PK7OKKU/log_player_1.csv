"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $380,000.
