Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants a slightly larger share.

I'll reject his offer for now and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit too greedy, Bob!""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a small slice of the pie, Bob.""
