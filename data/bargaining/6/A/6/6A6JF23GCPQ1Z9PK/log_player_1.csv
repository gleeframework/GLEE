"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This means I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of my gain due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less for me, I'd like to get a higher share. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This way, I'm aiming to get a higher share while still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
