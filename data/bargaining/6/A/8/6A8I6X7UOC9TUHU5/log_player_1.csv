"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get a slightly bigger share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share this time. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 80% of 4000, which is 3200.

I'm not convinced that a 60-40 split is fair, especially since the money is worth less now. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced, I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to two rounds of inflation (80% * 80% = 64%), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll offer a 64-36 split""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let's do a 55-45 split, with me taking the larger share. I think this is fair, considering the inflation we've both experienced. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 51.2% of its original value (64% * 80% = 51.2%), my gain of 4500 is actually worth 2304 (4500 * 51.2%).

I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is fair, considering the significant difference in the value of the money. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 55-45 is fair, I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 51.2% of its original value, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.
