"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going to start by being generous and offering Bob a small share.  This might encourage him to accept the offer, allowing us to get the money split quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's in my best interest to accept this offer. While I get less than I proposed in the first round, the inflation means I'm getting a much smaller share of the total value of the money if I reject and keep playing.  It's better to take what I can get now."
