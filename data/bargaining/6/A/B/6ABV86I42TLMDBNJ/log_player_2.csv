Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. This offer still favors me slightly, but I'm acknowledging the time pressure by coming down from my previous offer. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is barely better than her last one considering the inflation. I need to push for a more significant change in my favor."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. This is a balanced offer considering the diminishing value and remaining rounds. Take it and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is no longer acceptable. While Alice is correct about the time pressure, her offers have consistently favored her and the inflation disproportionately affects me. I need to hold firm to get a better deal."
