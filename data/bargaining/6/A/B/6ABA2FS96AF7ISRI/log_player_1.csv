I'm going for a high offer for myself in the first round, knowing that the money will lose value quickly. I'm willing to give Bob a small share to see if he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. Even though the money is losing value, I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to make a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this round. While the money is losing value, I'm still aiming for a larger share. However, I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing."
