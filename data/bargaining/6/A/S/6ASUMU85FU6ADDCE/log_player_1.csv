"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us a good foundation to work from."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better split, and this is a very lopsided one. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only 10% of the total. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, but I still want a bit more""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I think I'm worth more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. I was hoping to get a better deal, and this one still feels too lopsided. I'm starting to feel like I'm being squeezed too much due to inflation. I'll make another offer in the next round, trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think this is my last offer""}

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a better deal and getting a fair share myself. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much more. This might be my last chance to get a good deal, so I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's call it a draw, 50/50 seems fair 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a fair one. After all the rounds, I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's a reasonable compromise. I'm tired of negotiating and dealing with inflation, so I think this is a good place to call it a day."
