Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a high offer in the first round, hoping Bob will be satisfied with a smaller amount. I'm willing to share a bit, but I want to get the majority of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would love to have more, 50% is a good share, especially since the money is getting worth less with each round. I'll take it!"
