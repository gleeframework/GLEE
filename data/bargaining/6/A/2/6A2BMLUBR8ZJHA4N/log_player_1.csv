"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This seems more fair, as we both get a substantial amount. We can end this quickly, and neither of us will lose much value. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
