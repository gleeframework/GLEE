"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively equal split, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a new approach, I'll give you a small share, but I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept this offer, but I'll make sure to negotiate harder in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
