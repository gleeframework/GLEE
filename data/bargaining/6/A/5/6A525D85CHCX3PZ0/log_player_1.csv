"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money, I need to be more cautious. Considering the inflation, the value of the money I'll gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less.

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but it's still a decent compromise. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
