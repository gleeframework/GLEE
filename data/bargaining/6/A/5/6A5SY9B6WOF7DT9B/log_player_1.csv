"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob is willing to accept a fair and equal division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's still biased towards Bob, and I think I can do better in the next round. I'm hoping that the value of the money will decrease further due to inflation, making my next offer more attractive."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting the money's value, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! I'm offering you a slightly better deal this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, trying to give Bob a slightly better deal while still getting a decent share for myself. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
