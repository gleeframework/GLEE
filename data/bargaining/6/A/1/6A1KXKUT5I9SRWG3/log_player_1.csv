"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 9:1 split in my favor, with me taking 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving $100,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. 50/50 split for now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept this offer.
