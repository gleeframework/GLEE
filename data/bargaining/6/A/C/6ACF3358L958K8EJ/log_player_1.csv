Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I'm going to need a little more to accept this offer. I'm proposing $60 for myself and $40 for you. If you accept, we can finish this game and avoid any more inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
