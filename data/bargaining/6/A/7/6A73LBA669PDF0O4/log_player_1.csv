Bob is still getting a larger share even with the inflation working against him.  I'm willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can get closer to an even split."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob is finally willing to accept a 50/50 split. Accepting is the best option now because:

* **Fairness:**  The inflation disproportionately affects Bob, but we're running out of time. A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome at this point.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value diminishes significantly. Waiting longer risks getting a much smaller amount, even if I could secure a slightly better split in a later round."
