I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the one making the initial offer.  Let's see how Bob feels about this!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and with the inflation, I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round."
