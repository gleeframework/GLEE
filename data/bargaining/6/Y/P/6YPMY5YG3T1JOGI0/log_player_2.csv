Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's find a compromise. This offer is a good middle ground considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  We are both losing money due to inflation. Let's agree now before it gets worse. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, Alice's offer is becoming more reasonable as time goes on and inflation eats into the value. Accepting a 40/60 split now is better than holding out for a slightly better deal and risking getting nothing at all if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
