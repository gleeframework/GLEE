Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting impatient. This is my last offer before I start taking a bigger share.  The clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is playing a very aggressive game, but he's given us an opening. He keeps stating ""final offers"", yet continues to negotiate.  This suggests he might be bluffing about taking a larger share and is actually more willing to make a deal than he lets on.  We need to hold our nerve and see if he'll move closer to a more even split."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm serious about getting this done, but it needs to be fair. This offer is my bottom line - take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Calling the bluff:**  Bob keeps making threats but also keeps negotiating. This offer tests his resolve.  By making a firm ""bottom line"" statement, we force him to reveal how serious he is about walking away.
* **Strategic concession:**  While we're standing firm, we are conceding by increasing Bob's share. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise, but also shows we're not going to be pushed around. 
* **Time pressure:**  Time is working against us due to inflation, but it's also putting pressure on Bob to get a deal done. He might be willing to accept a less favorable deal now rather than risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're making a mistake.  I'm getting closer to taking it all.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his pattern of threats and ""final offers"".  He's becoming predictable.  It's a risky move, but we need to call his bluff again.  The time pressure is increasing, but if he's not willing to move significantly from this point, we'll be forced to accept a very unfavorable deal in the later rounds anyway."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alright Bob, you're right, time is running out. This is my final offer - let's end this and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Increased Pressure:**  Time is becoming critical. We need to secure a deal soon or risk the effects of inflation significantly diminishing our returns. 
* **Finality:** This offer emphasizes the need for resolution. By stating it as our ""final offer"" we are mirroring Bob's language and conveying a sense of urgency.
* **Significant Concession:** Offering Bob $400,000 is a significant concession. It shows we're serious about reaching a compromise and willing to take a hit to end the negotiation. 

We're now at a point where we must balance our desire for a larger share with the increasing risk of getting nothing. This offer represents a strong effort to secure a reasonable deal while acknowledging the game's constraints."
