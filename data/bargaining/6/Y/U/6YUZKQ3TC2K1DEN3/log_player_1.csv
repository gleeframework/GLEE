"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept a fair division. This opening offer allows room for negotiation while also demonstrating a willingness to share the money. The message is brief and to the point, aiming to set a cooperative tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should switch it up this time. Your turn next round! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because it's less favorable to me than my initial proposal. By rejecting, I'm choosing to proceed to the next round, where I can make a counteroffer that might be more advantageous. Given the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, I'm motivated to negotiate a better split to maximize my gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to a 52-48 split in my favor, attempting to find a middle ground between my initial proposal and Bob's counteroffer. The message invites Bob to consider this compromise, emphasizing the need for cooperation to avoid further losses due to inflation. By making this offer, I'm trying to create a sense of mutual benefit and encourage Bob to accept, while still prioritizing my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle this.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer because, considering the increasing impact of inflation, further negotiation may lead to diminishing returns. With the money already worth 14.26% less than its initial value, the difference between our proposed splits is becoming less significant in real terms. Bob's message framing this as his ""final offer"" also suggests that he may not be willing to compromise further. Accepting now secures a gain, albeit smaller than initially hoped, rather than risking a potentially worse outcome or even no agreement at all if we exhaust all rounds without a deal."
