"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not accepting your initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still fair, I think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a good start to the negotiations!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a 60-40 split, which is the same as my initial offer, but now it's worth less for me. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer. I'll try to get a slightly better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the inflation, but I'm willing to meet you halfway as you suggested. This seems like a reasonable split, considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a 45-55 split, which is still not favorable to me. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's aim for a 50-50 split, considering the inflation is eating into the value of the money. It's only fair we split it equally now.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
