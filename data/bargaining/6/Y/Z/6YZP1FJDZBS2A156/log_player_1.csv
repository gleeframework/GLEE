"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount of money and can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should flip the script on your offer.  I'll keep $900000 and give you $100000.  This way, we can both see what it's like to be on the other side of the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to turn the tables on me!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $100,000, which is worth 90% of the original $100,000 due to inflation.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to be on the short end of the stick. I'll reject your offer and make a new one.""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $300,000 and keep $700,000. This way, I'll have a decent amount to work with, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good amount and being willing to compromise to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be fair. I'm proposing we split the money 70/30.  I think it's time to be reasonable, and this is a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a compromise.

However, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 70/30 split, especially since I'm already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 70/30 is fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing. I'd like to propose an alternative.""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000. This way, I'll have a bit more to work with, but I'm still willing to compromise to get a deal done. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and being willing to compromise to reach an agreement."
