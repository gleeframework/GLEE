Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you $400000 and keep $600000. This way, I'll have a bit more to work with, but I'm still willing to compromise to get a deal done. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

I'm going to take this deal. It's a better offer than I was able to get her to take before, and with every round the value of the money decreases for Alice. This offer is a good compromise for both of us."
