Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a greedy approach in the first round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm going to try to maximize my own share.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure how many more rounds it will take for Bob to accept my offer.  I don't want to risk the money losing value even more.  It's a decent split and I'm happy to take it."
