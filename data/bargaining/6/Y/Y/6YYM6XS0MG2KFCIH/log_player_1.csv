"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my share of $400,000 is now worth $360,000. I'm not sure I want to give Bob a 60-40 split, especially since the money is worth less for me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away all the value. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering a 42-58 split, trying to find a middle ground."
