"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair starting point.  We both lose money with each round, so let's work towards a solution quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
