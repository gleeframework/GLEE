**Reasoning:** Alice is sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value is decreasing significantly. While a 50/50 split seems impossible, holding out for a slightly better offer is still the best strategy at this point.  The longer the game goes on, the more pressure there is on Alice to make a better deal."
