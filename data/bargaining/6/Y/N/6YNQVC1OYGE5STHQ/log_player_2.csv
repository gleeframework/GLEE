"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a little more since I'm the first to propose, but we can work from here. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm Bob, and I want to maximize my share! While it's tempting to accept a fair offer, rejecting gives me the chance to propose a more favorable split. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the bigger share this time.  It's a fair compromise, considering you got the better end of the deal last round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to give a little more to avoid further rounds of negotiation.  How about we split it 55/45, with me taking slightly less this time? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic move.  The inflation means my share is worth significantly less now, and rejecting could lead to a less favorable offer from Alice in the next round. 55/45 is a decent split, and I'm willing to take it to secure some gains."
