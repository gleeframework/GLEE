"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she receives $60 and Bob receives $40, with the message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"".\n\n###\n\nNow it's Bob's turn. He can either accept Alice's offer or reject it and make a counteroffer. If Bob accepts, the game ends, and they divide the money according to Alice's proposal. If Bob rejects, the game continues, and he makes a new proposal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n(Note: I'll keep track of the rounds and the decreasing value of money for Bob.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable, this offer accounts for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although he says it accounts for the time value of money, I believe I can get a better deal, especially since the money is worth the same to me but less to him with each passing round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n(Note: Remember to apply the 20% decrease in value for Bob's gain again in the next round if he rejects my offer.)"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI'll make a new proposal. Considering the decreasing value of money for Bob, I'll try to find a balance that benefits me while still being somewhat appealing to him.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Inflation is on my side, but I'm still willing to share""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n(Note: Keep in mind that the money is now worth 40% less to Bob than it was in the first round, due to the 20% decrease in value per round.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. It's a 50/50 split or nothing. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Although I was trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal, a 50/50 split is still a reasonable outcome. Given that Bob is being quite firm and the game could potentially continue indefinitely, I'll choose to end the game here.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know that the game has ended.\n\n###\n\n(Note: It seems we've reached a mutually acceptable agreement!)"
