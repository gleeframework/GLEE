I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything.  Since we have 12 rounds, the money won't be worth much in the later rounds anyway.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a measly $1."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much better deal for me. I'm getting 500,000, and although it's worth 20% less than what I proposed in the first round, it's still a lot of money! It's also a fair split."
