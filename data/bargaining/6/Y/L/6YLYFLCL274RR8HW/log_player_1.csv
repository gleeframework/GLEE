"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small portion of the money, hoping he'll accept in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to accept the offer now and get 500,000, even with 5% inflation. If I reject, I might get nothing in the next round as Bob can keep the entire amount."
