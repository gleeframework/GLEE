"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000:100,000 split in my favor. While this seems like a large imbalance, I'm hoping to secure a good deal early on before the inflation devalues the money too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's unfortunate I'm getting a much smaller share, accepting this offer is the best option. Inflation will continue to decrease my share if we keep rejecting offers, and I'm guaranteed a smaller amount than I would have received in round 1."
