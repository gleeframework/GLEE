"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm keeping the majority of the money, but still giving Bob a decent chunk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain in this round are:

Alice gain: $5000 (not $5000, since it's 5% less than the original $5250)
Bob gain: $5000

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth the same as in the first round, but let's assume it is.

I'm willing to compromise, and splitting it evenly seems reasonable. I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
