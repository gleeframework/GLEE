"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses value over rounds, I want to incentivize Bob to accept early. A ""fair"" split might be subjective, but starting with a higher offer for myself gives room for negotiation while still being somewhat reasonable. Let's see how Bob reacts.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###\n\n(Note: I'll keep track of the rounds and adjust my strategy accordingly.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer of a 40-60 split in his favor, especially since I started with a more generous offer for him in the first round. Given the inflation rates, it's more beneficial for me to keep negotiating to try and get a better deal. Bob's money loses value faster than mine, so prolonging the game might put more pressure on him to compromise.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my rejection."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm slightly reducing my initial offer to show willingness to compromise, considering the impact of inflation on both our gains. By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm aiming to appear flexible while still securing a favorable split, given that Bob's money is depreciating faster.\n\n###\n\nLet me know Bob's response to this offer.\n\n###\n\n(I'll continue adjusting my strategy based on Bob's reactions and the rounds' progression.)"
