"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 52.5% / 47.5% split in my favor.  Consider accepting, each round the total amount shrinks! 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The 5% decrease in value isn't that significant yet, and I think I can get a better deal. Besides, I'm not sure I want to settle for less than half of the original amount. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than your initial offer, Alice. Considering the decreasing value, let's split it 55% for me and 45% for you. It's more than fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI've made a counteroffer that gives me a slightly larger share, taking into account the 5% decrease in value from the previous round. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth isn't helping either of us. Let's stop wasting time and split it evenly 50/50. It's the fairest deal we'll get. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of the money, I think accepting the 50/50 split is the best option. We've already lost 9.75% of the value, and continuing to negotiate might lead to further losses. Alice is right; this is probably the fairest deal we'll get. I'll accept her offer and end the game here."
