"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll give you a bit less, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 being broken, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can do better than this. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a decent chunk!""}

I'm trying to get a bit more of the pie, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
