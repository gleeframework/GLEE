"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. It's a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. What do you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I don't think this offer is as good as mine was, considering the inflation. I'd rather not accept this offer. I'll reject it and try to do better next time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the 20% inflation that has already occurred.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```

I'm offering you a slightly larger share, $5,200, in an attempt to sweeten the deal. What do you think?"
