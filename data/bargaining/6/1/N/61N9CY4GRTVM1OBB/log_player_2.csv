Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit imbalanced. How about a 45/55 split? It accounts for the time value of money with the inflation.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to go for a 50/50 split now. It's the most fair way to divide the money with the inflation affecting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
