"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40. This leaves me with $60, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it 50/50, huh? That's a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the inflation, my gain of $50 is actually worth $47.50 (95% of $50).

I'll reject this offer for now and try to do better. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain of $50 is now worth $47.50 in real value.

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Bob $45, which is worth $42.75 in real value, and keeping $55, which is worth $52.25 in real value. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting hard! Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $45 is actually worth $38.71 in real value.

Considering Bob's offer, my gain of $45 is worth $38.71, and Bob's gain of $55 is worth $46.96 in real value. This is a tough decision, but I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $45 is actually worth $38.71 in real value.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of the money:

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I'm offering Bob $52, which is worth $44.64 in real value, and keeping $48, which is worth $41.07 in real value. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll now! Since the money is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, my gain of $40 is actually worth $30.88 in real value.

Considering Bob's offer, my gain of $40 is worth $30.88, and Bob's gain of $60 is worth $46.38 in real value. This is a tough decision, but I think I should be careful not to give up too much more.
