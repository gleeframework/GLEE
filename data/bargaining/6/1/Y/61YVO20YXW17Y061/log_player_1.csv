"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. This way, I can avoid the potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though Bob is offering me a significantly smaller amount, I still believe I can get a better deal. The inflation rate is working against me, but I think I can still negotiate a more favorable split by making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob 400,000. While this is less than what he offered in round 2, it's still a significant amount, and I'm hoping the fear of further inflation will push him to accept. I'm also trying to position myself for a better deal in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly decreased the value of my potential gains, I'm going to accept this offer.  It's the best offer I've received, and it's unlikely Bob will offer me more in the next round.  Continuing to play would only further decrease the value of the money, making this offer the most sensible option."
