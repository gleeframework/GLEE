This is a tricky situation, but accepting is now the best option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  While Bob's offer is the same as your Round 1 proposal, inflation has eaten into your potential gains. Accepting 525,000 now is better than risking getting a worse deal later as the value decreases.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob is likely trying to stall, knowing inflation hurts you more. He's betting you'll become more desperate and accept a worse deal as time runs out.

While not ideal, taking the current offer cuts your losses from inflation and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
