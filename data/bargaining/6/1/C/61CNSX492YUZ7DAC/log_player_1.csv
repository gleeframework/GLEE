"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% of the total. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a relatively fair split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
