{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go down a bit, but 70-30 is my final offer. If we don't agree now, the money will continue to lose value for me.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said 70-30 was your final offer, but I think it's more fair if I get the 70% 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's less than what I initially hoped for, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for me. Accepting this offer is the best way to salvage some of the potential earnings."
