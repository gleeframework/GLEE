"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave 20% for Bob. This way, we can both get a decent amount and have some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $6000 I would gain in this round is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $5700. That's a decent amount, but I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 90% of the original amount now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not offering much more than the last round. I'm willing to take a risk and go for a bigger share.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $9,500 (after adjusting for inflation) and leaving 30% for Bob. This is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a 50/50 split. This is my best offer, so I hope you'll accept it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $5000 I would gain in this round is worth 91.74% of the original amount, which is $4,587. But the offer is a 50/50 split, which is a good compromise.
