Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a mere $1. I figure he might accept it just to get something, and if he doesn't, I'll have a chance to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to wait for a better one."
