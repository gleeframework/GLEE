"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80:20 split in my favor, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $80 is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'm looking at a gain of $64.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting $50, which is more than my previous offer of $80 in terms of purchasing power. I'm willing to accept this offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
