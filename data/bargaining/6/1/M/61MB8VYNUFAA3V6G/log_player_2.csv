Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $60, you take $40. This seems fair considering the money loses value quickly for me.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing rapidly for me. I'll take $55, you take $45.  It's the same split you offered, but in reverse because time is on your side, not mine. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
