"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. I believe this is fair given the potential risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a significant portion, but I think a 60/40 split is more reasonable, considering the uncertainty of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
