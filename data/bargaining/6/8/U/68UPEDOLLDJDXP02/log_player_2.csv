"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate affects me more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the inflation rate affects Alice more, I think I can negotiate for a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. Let's split it this way!""}\n\n###\nI've made an offer that takes into account the inflation rate and its effects on both of us. I believe this is a reasonable proposal that Alice might accept. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Since the inflation rate affects Alice more, her gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, whereas mine is only worth 19% less. I think I can still negotiate for a better deal, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I think this is a more reasonable offer. The value of money is decreasing rapidly for both of us!""}\n\n###\nI've made another offer, taking into account the decreasing value of money for both Alice and me. Since Alice's gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, I believe I can propose a slightly more favorable deal for myself. Let's see if Alice accepts this one!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We need to settle this quickly. The inflation is eating away at our gains. This offer is a slight improvement for me, but let's make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of money for both of us, I think this is a reasonable deal. The inflation rate is indeed eating away at our gains, and it's better to settle now rather than risk losing even more value in the next rounds. With this offer, I'll at least secure $4800, which is still a significant amount. Let's finalize the deal!"
