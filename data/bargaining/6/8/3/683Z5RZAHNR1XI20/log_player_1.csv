{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with the offer, as I was hoping for a slightly better split. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob to make another proposal. Maybe he'll be willing to give me a slightly better deal in the next round!"

{""decision"": ""accept""}

Hmm, Bob is offering me 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and keeping 20% for himself, which is $20. Considering the inflation, I think this is a decent offer, and I'm willing to accept it. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's not bad either."
