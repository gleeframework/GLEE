"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is the best way to ensure we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $500,000
Bob gain: $400,000

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting more than me, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rate, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you can do better.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 10% increase from the $360,000 he would have received if the money was worth 20% less from the first round."
