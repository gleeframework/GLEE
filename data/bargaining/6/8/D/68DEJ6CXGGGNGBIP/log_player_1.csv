"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, let's see if we can agree on a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping we can build on this and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a more balanced split, but I'll start with a slightly higher offer 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed towards his gain. I'd like to get a slightly more balanced split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll, I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to balance the split, but I need to protect my share""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation."

# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to squeeze out a bit more."

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still want a fair share""

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it down the middle, but I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out""
