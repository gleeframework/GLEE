"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 3200 in the previous round's money. This offer is still not great for me.

```

I'll wait for a better offer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher gain to compensate. Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think I deserve more""
