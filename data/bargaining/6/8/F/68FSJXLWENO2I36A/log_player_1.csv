"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going for a slightly aggressive opening move.  I'll take most of the money, but I'm leaving Bob a tiny sliver just in case he's super risk-averse.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a fair offer, and it's much better than getting nothing.  Let's take it!"
