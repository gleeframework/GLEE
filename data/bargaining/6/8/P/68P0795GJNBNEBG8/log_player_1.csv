"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair and simple proposal to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's share, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my share is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
