,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I think we can both do better than 90/10.  Let's try a more even split.  How about 55/45 in my favor? We can then use the remaining money to invest in a new business venture together!,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Okay, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is too much in your favor.  Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share.  This gives you a good amount, and leaves us both with a comfortable sum.  What do you think?",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. We both have a chance to lose more money with each passing round. I'm offering a 52.5/47.5 split, which is fairer than the previous offers and gives us both a decent amount.  Let's agree and move on.",Bob,4,
