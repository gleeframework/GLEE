Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very uneven offer. I figure Bob might accept a tiny amount in the first round, especially with the inflation rate working against him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm getting less than I initially offered, it's still a very good deal for me, and the inflation rate is working strongly against Bob. It's better to accept this offer than to risk losing a lot more in future rounds."
