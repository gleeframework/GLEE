"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, you can have 20 dollars""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 2:3, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already starting to bite!

Considering the new proposal, I'll have to think carefully. With the 10% reduction in value, my potential gain of $60 is now worth only $54. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $40 is still worth $40.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 54:40 split just yet. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% reduction in value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50:50, a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split this time, hoping Bob will see the value in being fair and we can end the game quickly."
