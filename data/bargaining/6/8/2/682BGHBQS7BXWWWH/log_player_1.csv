Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a slightly aggressive but fair first offer. I'm taking the lion's share, but still leaving Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to keep more,  the inflation is a real threat. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best way to ensure I get something at all.  Let's end this game!"
