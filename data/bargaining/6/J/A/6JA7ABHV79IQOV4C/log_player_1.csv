"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose that I take $9,000 and Bob takes $1,000.  This ensures that I get the most money possible, and I will have the opportunity to make an offer to Bob if he refuses.  It's important to get a feel for Bob's style and whether he is willing to negotiate or if he is more likely to take anything he can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more money, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and will likely get the same amount or more if I reject this offer."
