"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider Bob's new offer.

Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, $5,000, but now Bob's gain is worth 20% less, $6,000 is equivalent to $4,800 in the first round.

Considering this, I think I can do better than $4,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $4,800 in the first round, and he offered $6,000 in the second round, which is worth $4,800 in the first round, I'll try to make an offer that's a bit more aggressive.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal you think you are!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving me $5,500 and Bob $4,500. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round. Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, $5,400 is equivalent to $5,400 / (1 - 0.488) = $10,385.71 in the first round.

Considering my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, $5,500, I think I can do better than $4,600. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round. Since Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less, $4,800 is equivalent to $4,800 / (1 - 0.6723) = $14,563.64 in the first round.

Considering my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, $5,500, I think I can do better than $5,200. However, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal from Bob. I'll accept this offer.
