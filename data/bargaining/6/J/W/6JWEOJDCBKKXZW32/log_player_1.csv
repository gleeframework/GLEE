"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI am offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous offer considering the inflation penalty he will incur if he rejects it. I am confident that he will accept this offer, as it is a significant amount of money and he will not want to risk losing 20% of the value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the clock is ticking. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I have no incentive to accept an offer that is less than my initial proposal. Additionally, Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor, which makes me think he is trying to take advantage of the inflation penalty. I will make a new proposal in the next round that is more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""You had your chance, now it's my turn again""}\n\nI am increasing my share of the money in this proposal, as I believe Bob will be more willing to accept a less favorable offer due to the inflation penalty he will incur if he rejects it. My message is a reminder to Bob that he had the opportunity to accept a more generous offer in the first round, and now he will have to settle for less. I am confident that he will accept this offer, as the inflation penalty is starting to take its toll on his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be reasonable, but this needs to be more balanced for us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because it is still not favorable enough to me. Although Bob is trying to appear reasonable, his offer is still skewed in his favor, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation penalty is taking a significant toll on Bob's potential gains, and I am confident that he will be more willing to accept a less favorable offer as the rounds progress. I will continue to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob""}\n\nI am increasing my share of the money in this proposal, as I believe Bob is becoming more desperate due to the inflation penalty. My message is a reminder to Bob that time is running out, and he needs to make a decision soon. I am confident that he will accept this offer, as the inflation penalty is significantly reducing his potential gains, and he will not want to risk losing even more value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real.  Time is running out.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I am rejecting Bob's offer because, although he is proposing a 50/50 split, the inflation penalty has significantly reduced the value of his share. In reality, his $500,000 is now worth much less than my $500,000, making this offer still unfair to me. I will hold out for a better deal, as I believe Bob will be even more desperate in the next round.

In reality, his $450,000 is now worth much less than my $550,000, making this offer still unfair to me. I will hold out for a better deal, as I believe Bob will be even more desperate in the next round.
