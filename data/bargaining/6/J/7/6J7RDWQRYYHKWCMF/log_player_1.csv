Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more equitable. I propose we split the money closer to a 55/45 ratio, recognizing that while inflation is a factor, it's important to ensure both of us have a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
