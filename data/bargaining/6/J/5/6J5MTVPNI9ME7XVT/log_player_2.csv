"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value more rapidly for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is reasonable, I'd like to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation rate is higher for me.  Let's see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think this split is more fair, considering the inflation rates we're facing. Let's get this settled.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer still stands. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and depreciation of the asset. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still think I could get a slightly better deal, the inflation is really starting to hurt.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get some of the money before it becomes completely worthless."
