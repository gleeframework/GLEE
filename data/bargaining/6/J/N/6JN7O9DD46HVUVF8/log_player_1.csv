"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 600,000$ and Bob gets 400,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of 500,000$ is worth 80% of 600,000$, and Bob's gain of 500,000$ is worth 95% of 400,000$.

I accept Bob's offer.
