Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's split it down the middle.  50/50 is the fairest option now, given the inflation.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's end the game here. With the inflation, accepting the 50/50 offer seems like the best option to maximize my gain."
