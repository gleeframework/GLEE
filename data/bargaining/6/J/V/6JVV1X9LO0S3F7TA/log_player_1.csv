Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable starting point.  We can continue to negotiate if you'd like, but let's try to reach an agreement before too much value is lost. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
