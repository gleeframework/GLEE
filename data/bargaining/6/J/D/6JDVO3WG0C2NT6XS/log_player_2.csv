Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, be realistic, the money is losing value for you 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Okay, let's split it evenly.  The clock is ticking and it's hurting us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your even split isn't so even with inflation, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is correct that my previous 50/50 split isn't as fair with the inflation considered, BUT her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but not be walked all over.  We're getting into dangerous territory with the number of rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47,
""alice_gain"": 53,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. We need to settle this before inflation eats away at the value any further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, but I need to be realistic.  Time is running out, and the value for me is decreasing rapidly each round. If I reject this, there's a good chance Alice will push even further in her favor, and I'll be left with even less.  It's not ideal, but it's better to take something now than risk getting nothing at all."
