"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100 and leave 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since Bob is offering me 40, that's 40% of the current value of the money, which is 90% of the original $100 (due to the 10% inflation). So, in terms of the original $100, I'd be getting 40% of 90%, which is 36.

Similarly, Bob would be getting 60, which is 60% of 90%, or 54.

Considering the relative values, this offer seems reasonable. I'll accept it.
