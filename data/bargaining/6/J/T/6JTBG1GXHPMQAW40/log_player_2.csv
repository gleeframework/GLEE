Let's see how this plays out. While not ideal, I need to aim for a better split."

# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this. I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but I need to secure a decent amount for myself too. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer might seem a bit high, but remember the value decreases rapidly with each round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is getting dangerous, but Alice's offer is still unacceptable.  It's better to risk getting nothing than to be taken advantage of like this. I have to show I'm serious about getting a fairer share."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

```

Time is running out.  I'm reiterating my previous offer to show I'm serious about the 40/60 split.  Alice needs to realize that her stubbornness could cost us both everything."
