"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, but I'm willing to give you a small share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my potential gain is worth 10% less than before, so I need to be strategic.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75/25 split, even if it's a ""generous"" offer from Bob's perspective. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal or propose a counteroffer. The game is on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further!"
