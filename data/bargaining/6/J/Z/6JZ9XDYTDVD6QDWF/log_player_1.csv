"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a slightly larger share for taking the risk of moving to the next round.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm essentially getting $4,000 in this round, which is only $1,000 more than my original proposal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share this time. Your turn!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need a larger share to compensate for the risk I took by rejecting your offer. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the offer, I'm getting $3,500, which is even less than my original proposal. Bob is still getting a significant amount, $6,500.

I'll have to think carefully about this one... but I think I'll decide to reject this offer again, hoping to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I should get a bit more considering the value of the money has decreased so much. Let's make a deal!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, where I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500."
