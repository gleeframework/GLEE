Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 3:1 ratio, where I receive $7500 and you receive $2500. This ensures a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 2:1 split, considering the value of money will decrease more for me in subsequent rounds. This way, we can both benefit from the initial value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
