"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
I'm offering to take 80% of the money, leaving Bob with 20%. This seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'm getting 50% of the money, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite generous, especially since the money he gains is worth 10% less than in the previous round.

I'll accept this offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
