Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 95/5 split is more fair, given the inflation risk. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
