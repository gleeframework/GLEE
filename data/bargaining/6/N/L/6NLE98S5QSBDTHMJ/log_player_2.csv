"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 60/40. It's a fair starting point, and we can adjust from there. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 60/40 split isn't quite what I had in mind, and I'm willing to take a risk to potentially get a better deal. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more in my favor, considering the inflation that affects both of us. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to try to secure a larger share while still being somewhat reasonable to avoid pushing Alice into rejecting outright.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 55/45 is a fairer split. It gives me a bit more, but you still get a significant share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is affecting us both, but I think 52.5/47.5 is a fairer split, considering my offer in round 1. Let's be reasonable and reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation and the fact that Alice has moved closer to a 50/50 split, I'm more inclined to accept this offer. The difference in our proposed splits is getting smaller, and the risk of further devaluation might not be worth the potential gain from holding out for another round.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
