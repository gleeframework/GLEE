"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll think carefully about this offer. 

I'll reject the offer from Bob.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll make a new proposal.
