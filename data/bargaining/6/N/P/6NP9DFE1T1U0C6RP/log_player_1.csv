"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering to split the money evenly, 50/50. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a bigger share, huh?

I'll think about it for a moment...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60/40, I'll try to adjust my offer to be slightly more favorable to myself. Here's my proposal for round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to take a bigger share!

Since my gains are worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gains are worth 48.8% less, I think I can afford to be a bit more generous. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
