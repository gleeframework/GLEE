"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the value of the money is decreasing each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation affects Bob's gain more than mine. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation, this is a better deal for you!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose to take $58 and give Bob $42, with a message suggesting that considering the inflation, this is a better deal for Bob compared to the previous round. The money is worth 40% less for Bob now, so I'm trying to persuade him that it's better to accept this offer rather than waiting for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  I'm willing to give you a good deal, but the value of the money is dropping significantly for me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer because, although I was hoping for a better deal, Bob's message suggests that this is his final offer. Considering the significant drop in value for Bob, it's likely that he won't accept any less in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting $40 is a reasonable decision at this point."
