"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 75/25. It's fair considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's too heavily weighted in Alice's favor. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal considering the risk of inflation. I'm willing to negotiate if you have a better proposal.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I propose a split of 60/40. This maintains a balance between our shares while accounting for the decreasing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, accepting this offer guarantees me some money.  The inflation is becoming a real factor and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round."
