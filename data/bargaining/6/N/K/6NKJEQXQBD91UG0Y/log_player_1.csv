"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I don't think this offer is fair, as it's a relatively small increase from my initial offer, and I'd like to get a bit more considering the risk of inflation. I'll reject the offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation risk. Will you meet me in the middle?""
