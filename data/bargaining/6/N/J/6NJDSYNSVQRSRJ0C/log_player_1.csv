"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30, it's a fair share!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70 dollars and Bob will get 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of 50 is actually worth 50 * 0.9 = 45 dollars, since it's 10% less than the original 50.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's indeed a fair split and I'll get a decent amount.
