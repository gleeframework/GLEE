Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should've taken my previous offer. Now I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57

```

It's painful, but the value of waiting for a potentially better offer is diminishing rapidly. Alice is clearly willing to play this game for a while. Accepting now cuts my losses.
