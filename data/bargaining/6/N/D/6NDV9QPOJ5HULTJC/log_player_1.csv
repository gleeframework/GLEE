"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, let's end it here 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll consider the actual value of the money I'll receive if I accept this offer. In this case, I'll receive $5,000, which is worth 80% of the original $6,000 I would have received in the first round.

I'll also consider the fact that Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so his actual gain is $5,000, which is worth 90% of the original $5,500 he would have received in the first round.

Considering these factors, I'll make a decision:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
