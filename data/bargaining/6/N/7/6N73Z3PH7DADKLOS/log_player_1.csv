"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not going all the way to 60% 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to adjust my decision. With the new offer, I'll gain $4,000, which is worth 95% of the original $6,000 I was offered in Round 1. Not a bad deal!

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
