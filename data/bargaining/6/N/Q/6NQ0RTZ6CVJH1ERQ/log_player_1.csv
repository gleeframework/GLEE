"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good starting point, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is a good move in this round. The inflation factor means my potential gains in the next round are significantly lower, and there's no guarantee Bob will be as generous."
