"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 80-20, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 60-40. Let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain of $40 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $36.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob's proposal, as it's a bit too skewed towards his favor. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my potential gain is now worth 81% of its original value ($40 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $32.4).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45-55 is a fairer split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which I think is a more balanced distribution of the remaining $100."
