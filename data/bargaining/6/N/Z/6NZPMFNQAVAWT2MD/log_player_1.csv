"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too low for me, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""I need a bit more than that to accept, Bob. Time is running out for both of us!""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be fair Alice, but this needs to work for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching closer to a more even split, but the pace is too slow. My potential gains are decreasing rapidly with each round. It's time to show Bob I'm serious about getting a larger share, or we both risk walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. I need to be compensated for the inflation, or we both lose!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking to my previous offer. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  The game has reached a critical point. Bob is no longer negotiating and is stubbornly sticking to his offer. While not ideal, accepting his offer of $5,500 is better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and it's time to cut my losses and secure what I can."
