# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best idea, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money."
