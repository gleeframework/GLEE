I'm starting with a proposal that heavily favors me, since the money is worth less to Bob in later rounds.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Even with the inflation, it's still a bad deal for me. I'm confident I can get a better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, taking into account the inflation that's impacting Bob more heavily. This should make the offer more appealing to him, while still giving me a decent share."
