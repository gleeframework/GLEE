"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, now I'm taking the majority. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to his favor!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not very fair, Bob! I'm not willing to give you 80% of the money. I'll counter with a new offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and preparing to make a new proposal for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better share. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to 60% and reducing Bob's share to 40%, hoping to get a better deal."
