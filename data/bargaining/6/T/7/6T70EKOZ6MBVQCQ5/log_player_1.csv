Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the $1,000,000 and leave 30% for Bob."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
