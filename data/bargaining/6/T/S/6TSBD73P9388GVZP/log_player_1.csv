"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive than mine, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain in the new value. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 4000 in the new value, which is equivalent to 5000 in the original value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
