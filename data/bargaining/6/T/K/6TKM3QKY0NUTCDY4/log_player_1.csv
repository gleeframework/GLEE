"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a division that seems relatively fair, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. Since the money loses value faster for me, I'll propose taking a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss over potential rounds. This way, we both get a significant amount, and the risk of further devaluation is somewhat mitigated for me. Plus, starting with a higher offer gives room for negotiation in subsequent rounds if needed. \n\n###\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's aim for a more balanced split, taking inflation into account. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI reject this offer because, given the inflation rates, accepting 40 dollars now would mean its value is significantly reduced compared to what it would have been in the first round. Since the money loses value faster for me, I'm incentivized to try and secure a better deal in the next rounds, hoping to minimize the impact of inflation on my gain. Additionally, accepting a lower amount without trying to negotiate further does not seem strategic, especially since we have multiple rounds left to reach a more favorable agreement.\n\n###\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the last offer, I'm willing to compromise but still need to account for the higher inflation on my end.""}\n\n###\nGiven that Bob's last offer was not acceptable and considering the increasing pressure of inflation on my potential gain, I'm adjusting my offer slightly from the first round to show willingness to compromise but still aiming to secure a larger share to offset the loss in value over time. This approach allows room for further negotiation while emphasizing the need to address the uneven impact of inflation on our gains.\n\n###\nYour turn!"
