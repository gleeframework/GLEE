# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, it's clear Alice is going to bleed me dry with the inflation working against me. While 38 is significantly less than I wanted, it's better than holding out and getting even less in future rounds."
