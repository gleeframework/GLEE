"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. I think this is a fair division, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is a friendly and neutral way to present the offer.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What will Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is being generous, I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each round, I have more bargaining power. I'll try to negotiate for a better share in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Getting impatient""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself. Since Bob is losing 10% of the value each round, I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to accept a less favorable offer to avoid further losses. The message ""Getting impatient"" conveys a sense of urgency, implying that I'm not willing to negotiate much further.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What will Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance Alice, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer again. Although Bob is trying to make it sound like a final offer, I think I can still get a better deal. The fact that the money is worth 27.1% less to Bob than in the first round means that Bob is getting desperate and will likely accept an even worse offer rather than risk losing more value. I'll try to push my advantage and negotiate for an even better share in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Final offer, take it or leave it""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $250,000 and keep $750,000 for myself. At this point, the money is worth significantly less to Bob than it was in the first round, so I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value. The message ""Final offer, take it or leave it"" conveys that I'm not willing to negotiate further, and Bob should take this offer seriously.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What will Bob say?"
