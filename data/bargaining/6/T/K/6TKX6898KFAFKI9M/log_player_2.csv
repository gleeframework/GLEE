Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Final offer, take it or leave it 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe. Rejecting this offer means risking an even worse deal in the next round, where the value for me will further decrease. Accepting the current offer, while not ideal, secures me a quarter of the total amount, which is better than getting a smaller share later or even nothing if I reject and we don't reach an agreement."
