"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a relatively aggressive offer, aiming to get a large share of the money.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to secure as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer gives me something, it's significantly worse than my initial proposal.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to lower my desired share slightly, but still aim for a significant portion. Bob's offer was way too low, so I need to show him that I'm willing to compromise but still want a fair share.  Since the money is worth less each round, I need to secure a good amount now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my initial proposal, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent portion and avoids further risk of inflation lowering the value even more."
