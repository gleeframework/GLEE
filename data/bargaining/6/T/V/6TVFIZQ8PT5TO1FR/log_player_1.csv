"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,

}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

# Bob gain: 60

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, hoping to get a slightly larger share to account for the decreasing value of the money."

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm not sure if I should accept a 30-70 split. I'll reject this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is getting scarcer and scarcer! With the value of my potential gain decreasing rapidly, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm going for a 60-40 split, hoping to get a larger share while the money is still worth something."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting! With the money worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm getting really desperate. A 20-80 split is a significant concession, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

However, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think I should take what I can get. I'll accept this offer.
