I'm going for a slightly uneven split, leaning in my favor since I know Bob's money will depreciate faster.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though I would have preferred a bigger share, the inflation will only get worse. It's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting less later!"
