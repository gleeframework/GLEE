"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it almost equally, considering I made the first offer 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round after she experiences the inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we both face.  Let's be reasonable and get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but the inflation penalty is still making a 48/52 split less appealing than a 55/45 split.  I'll see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 540000, ""alice_gain"": 460000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting us both, but let's find a solution before it gets worse.  I'm willing to concede a little to get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed getting worse, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is finally getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. While the inflation penalty is significant, this is a decent compromise, and any further rounds will only make the situation worse."
