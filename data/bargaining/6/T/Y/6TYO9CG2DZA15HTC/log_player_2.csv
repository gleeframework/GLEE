"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive devaluation. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While 4000$ is a decent amount, the inflation will eat away at its value significantly in future rounds. It's worth risking a rejection to see if Alice will budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way, we both avoid the risk of inflation devaluing our share in the future rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but time is literally money in this game. Let's be pragmatic and settle for a 55/45 split to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The inflation rate is significant, and while the initial offer was tempting, the 36% devaluation in the money I would receive has made the offer more appealing.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  Alice has already rejected a 50/50 split.  There's no guarantee she'll be more generous in future rounds.
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting this offer avoids further rounds and the risk of even lower offers due to inflation. 

While a 55/45 split isn't ideal, it's a reasonable compromise considering the current circumstances."
