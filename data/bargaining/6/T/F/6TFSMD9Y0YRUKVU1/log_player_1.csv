"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going for a slightly greedy but fair opening offer. I want to secure a large portion of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than my initial offer. I'm not going to accept a 55% loss on my potential earnings. I'll take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to reflect the inflation and Bob's rejection. I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm increasing Bob's share to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than his previous offer, it's still significantly less than what I believe I can get. I'm going to stick with my strategy of proposing a majority for myself and see if Bob will budge. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm continuing to adjust my offer, but still aiming for a larger share of the money. This time, I'm increasing Bob's share slightly again to make it more appealing. I believe the inflation is starting to affect Bob's decisions, and he might be more willing to compromise in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a terrible deal for me.  While I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, I still think I can get a better split in the next round. I'll stick with my strategy of proposing a majority for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly again, but I'm still hoping to secure a majority of the money. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I believe that Bob is also feeling the pressure. He might be more willing to compromise in the next round, and I want to be in a good position to take advantage of that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable, but I'm not going to give in yet.  I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal. The inflation is starting to have a serious impact, but I'm determined to hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I believe that Bob is also feeling the pressure. This might be my last chance to secure a decent share of the money.  I'm taking a risk, hoping that Bob is more willing to compromise now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and I'm running out of time. However, I'm still not willing to accept such a lopsided split. The inflation is severely impacting the value of the money, but I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is it. We're in the final round and I've had to concede a lot due to inflation, but I'm making a 50/50 offer.  I think Bob might be willing to accept a fair split rather than risk getting nothing at all."
