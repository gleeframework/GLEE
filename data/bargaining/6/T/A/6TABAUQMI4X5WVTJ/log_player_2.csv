"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems like a good starting point.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll try to find a compromise that reflects this.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable. Your turn, Alice!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient solution. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept the offer since the 50/50 split seems fair, and considering the increasing impact of inflation, it's better to settle now rather than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
