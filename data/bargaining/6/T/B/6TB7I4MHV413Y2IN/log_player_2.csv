**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of Bob's higher inflation rate.  While the offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, accepting now would still give Alice a significantly larger share. Bob's counter-offers are pushing towards a more equitable solution, and with the increasing inflation, Alice will feel more pressure to accept a fairer deal."
