"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this offer and we can both enjoy our gains. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Losing 5% value per round is a consideration, but I think I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 250000, ""alice_gain"": 750000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the loss of value due to inflation and made a counteroffer that still gives Alice the larger share but is more reasonable for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the decreasing value of the money for me due to inflation, I believe Alice's ""final offer"" is still not fair. I've already proposed a more equitable split, and I'm willing to take the risk of another round to see if I can get a better deal. The threat of it being a ""final offer"" might be a tactic to pressure me into accepting, but I'm not convinced it's the best I can get."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 275000, ""alice_gain"": 725000, ""message"": ""I've considered your 'final offer,' but I still believe we can find a more balanced split. Given the inflation, I'm taking a risk by continuing, so I hope you see the sincerity in my proposal.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've slightly increased my proposed share, considering the ongoing loss of value due to inflation. My message aims to convey a sense of compromise and the risk I'm taking by not accepting Alice's previous offer, hoping she might see the reason in meeting me closer to the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's wrap this up before it's worth even less for you. 
# Bob gain: 175000 
# Alice gain: 825000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, Alice's offer in this round is relatively more favorable than in previous rounds when adjusting for the loss of value over time. While I've aimed for a more equitable split, the decreasing value of the money for me makes this offer more reasonable at this stage. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a tangible amount rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
