"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my 40% gain is now worth 32% of the original 100$. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
