"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping to set a baseline for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'd like to adjust my gain accordingly. Since Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, I'll accept it, but I'll take into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept the 60/40 split. You got a good deal, but I'm hoping to do better next time!""
}
