Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're feeling the effects of inflation too, but I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. Let's try 45/55, closer to our initial offer, and see if we can find some common ground.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I can't go lower than 40.  Let's meet halfway. We're both feeling the impact of inflation, but a 40/60 split seems like a reasonable solution. What do you say?

The money is worth significantly less for Alice, and she's willing to compromise. A 40/60 split seems like a reasonable solution, considering the inflation.
