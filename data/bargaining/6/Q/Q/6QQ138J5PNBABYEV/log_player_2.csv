"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal. A 50/50 split might not be the best for me considering the inflation rate. Let's see what I can propose next.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a bit more than half.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll increase my share slightly to 52, considering the inflation, but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. The inflation is impacting my potential gain more significantly than Alice's, so I'm motivated to reach a deal sooner rather than later. However, I believe I can still negotiate a better split, given that we have several rounds left and the impact of inflation will continue to grow.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the increasing impact of inflation and Alice's previous offer, I'll try to meet her halfway between her last offer and my previous demand, considering the urgency to reach a deal due to the devaluing money.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 51.5, ""alice_gain"": 48.5, ""message"": ""Let's compromise, considering the rising inflation impact.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with Alice's response."
