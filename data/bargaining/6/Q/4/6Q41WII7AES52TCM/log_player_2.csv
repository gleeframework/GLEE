Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this back and forth isn't helping.  Let's end this now before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the decreasing value of the money is a factor, accepting this offer would mean I get less than 50% of the original amount. I believe I still have leverage to negotiate a slightly better deal in the coming rounds."

Round 6

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than fair considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is rapidly decreasing, and Alice is unlikely to budge further. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's slightly less than half. It's better to secure a win now than risk getting nothing in the end."
