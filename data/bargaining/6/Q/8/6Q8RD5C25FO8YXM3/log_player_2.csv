"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 60%, you take 40% - we both walk away with something good. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a different split. I think 55% for me and 45% for you is more reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nI made this decision because I want to take advantage of the fact that Alice's money is worth 10% less with each passing round, while mine is only worth 5% less. By offering a slightly more favorable split to myself, I'm trying to put pressure on Alice to accept the offer before the value of the money decreases further. At the same time, I'm still offering Alice a significant share to make it a reasonable proposal. Let's see what Alice thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this takes, the less we both get. I'm willing to come down slightly to 56%, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI decided to reject Alice's offer because, despite the decreasing value of the money, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer of 56% for herself is only a slight concession, and I'm not convinced it's her ""final offer"" as she claims. Given that the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation to see if I can get a more favorable split. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a stronger stance. Given the decreasing value of money, I think 58% for me and 42% for you is a more suitable split. Let's end this negotiation!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my proposed share to 58%, considering the impact of inflation on the value of money. As Alice's money is worth 19% less than in the first round, and mine is worth 9.75% less, I believe she will be more inclined to accept a less favorable split to avoid further losses. By making a more assertive offer, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept, rather than risking another round of negotiation. Will Alice accept or reject my proposal?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit here too. 52% for me is the lowest I'll go.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI decided to accept Alice's offer because, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of money, I believe this is the best deal I can get. With the money being worth 18.55% less for me and 34.39% less for Alice than in the first round, it's clear that further negotiation will only lead to more losses for both of us. Alice's offer of 52% for herself and 48% for me is a relatively fair split at this point, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further degradation of the money's value. It's time to end the negotiation and walk away with a reasonable share."
