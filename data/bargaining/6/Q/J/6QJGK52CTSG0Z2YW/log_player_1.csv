"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations!"

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take the majority, eh?

I'll have to think about it...

```

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking its toll on Bob's offer!

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit too greedy, Bob!""
