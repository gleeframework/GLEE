"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to start with.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split is a good starting point, but I'm hoping for a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 90% of the original $70 I proposed in the first round, which is $63. 

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's still a 50-50 split, but it's a bit less than what I initially proposed. I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of the original $70 I proposed in the first round, which is approximately $56.70.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit more aggressive, I think I deserve a bigger share now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 57.14% of the original $70 I proposed in the first round, which is approximately $40.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a 60-40 split, which is a significant deviation from the original 50-50 split. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 36.43% of the original $70 I proposed in the first round, which is approximately $25.50.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not going to give up entirely.""
}
```

I'm actually giving Bob a larger share than he proposed in the last round, in an attempt to negotiate a better deal."
