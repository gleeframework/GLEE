"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust the ratio in my favor. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This is a 55.5/44.5 split, which is closer to a 50/50 split, but still in my favor. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take its toll on Bob's offer. I'll consider this offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth less, I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
