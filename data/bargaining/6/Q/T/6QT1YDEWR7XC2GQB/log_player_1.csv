"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll need to adjust my expectations. Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to try to get a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money, so I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually a significant gain for him. I'll need to decide whether to accept this offer or continue negotiating. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think it's a good time to accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
