I'm proposing to take the majority of the money (990,000$) and leave 10,000$ for Bob.  It's a big difference, but I figure it's better to get the majority now than risk losing a bigger chunk in the next rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 950,000 for myself and 50,000 for Bob. Since he rejected my previous offer, I'm assuming he wants a bigger share. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer before inflation eats away at a larger portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to 900,000 for myself and 100,000 for Bob. I'm feeling confident that he'll accept this offer, as he's been rejecting mine and his offers are only getting worse due to inflation.  We're both losing money, but I believe this is the best move for me at this stage of the game."
