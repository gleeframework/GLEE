This is my initial offer. I'm taking a large share, but I'm leaving something for Bob in hopes of getting this over quickly.  Let's see if he's willing to accept!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try a slightly less aggressive approach this time, but still aiming for a majority share. It's a risk, but hopefully, Bob will realize that it's better to take something than risk getting nothing.  Let's see how he responds!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm going to try a middle ground approach this time. Bob's offers are getting more aggressive, so I need to be more flexible to avoid getting nothing. I believe this offer is fair and will give Bob a chance to take something before the inflation hits harder."

I'm going to try a compromise this time. The inflation is starting to affect Bob significantly, and I need to be careful not to lose out on a deal altogether.  I believe this offer gives Bob a good amount, while still securing a decent share for me. Let's see if this convinces him."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

This is a risky move, but I believe the inflation is starting to seriously impact Bob.  This offer is a 50/50 split.  It's my last chance to get a decent share before we both risk getting nothing.  Hopefully,  Bob will see the logic and accept."
