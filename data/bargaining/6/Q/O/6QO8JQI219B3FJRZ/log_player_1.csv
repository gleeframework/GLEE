Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it more fairly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Let's break down why:

* **Inflation hurts:** That $40 is worth significantly less than $40 in the previous round. 
* **Bob is pushing his luck:** While his offer sounds ""fair"" on the surface, the declining value of the money means he's getting a sweeter deal with each round that passes.

I'm willing to negotiate, but Bob needs to understand the time pressure is working against both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
