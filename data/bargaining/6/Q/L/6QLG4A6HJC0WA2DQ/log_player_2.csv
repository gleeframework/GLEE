Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob. Take this offer before inflation eats away at the value even more. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

*Reasoning:* While not ideal, accepting a slightly worse than even split is better than risking getting nothing as time runs out and the money continues to lose value."
