Let's see if I can get a better deal!  I'll try to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since we're both starting out, I think it's reasonable to ask for a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take its toll.  Accepting this offer means I get something, and it's better than getting nothing at all."
