I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself.  Let's see what Alice will propose next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is fair, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see if we can find a deal we both like.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 55-45 is a compromise 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than what I got in round 2, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. Let's take it."
