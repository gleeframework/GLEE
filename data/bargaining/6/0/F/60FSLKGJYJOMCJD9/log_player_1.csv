"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll get the bigger share, but I'll make it worth your while""
}
```

This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but I'm still offering Bob a decent chunk. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation advantage I get in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth even less now.

I'm not too keen on the 55/45 split, but I suppose it's a decent offer. I'll have to think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, my gain is worth 5% less than in round 2, and Bob's gain is still worth the same as in round 2.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think I'm going to give up too much!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
