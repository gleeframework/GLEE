"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose a 99/1 split in my favor, as I know I have the advantage in this game.  I'm hoping Bob will be eager to take the small offer in the first round, but I'm prepared for the game to go on for a few more rounds if he's stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much more reasonable than my initial proposal.  While it's not a perfect split, it's better than potentially getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement.  I'll take it."
