"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly better deal than your first offer. Let's see if we can find a fair solution. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual values are:

* My gain: 45 * 0.8 (80% of original value) = 36
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.9 (90% of original value) = 49.5

I'll accept Bob's offer.
