"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I think it's a fair starting point, given that I'm the one initiating the negotiation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous proposal. I'm not willing to settle for such a drastic reduction in my share, especially since the game is still early and there's a lot of time left to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a more equitable share than what Bob offered. Let's see if he's willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and the inflation is starting to take a serious toll. I'm still not willing to accept such a disproportionate split. I'll continue to negotiate and aim for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm willing to concede some ground, but I still believe I deserve a larger share.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before the inflation eats away any more of our potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers keep getting worse, and the inflation is really starting to bite into the potential winnings. I'm not willing to accept a 45/55 split, especially when I know I have the power to negotiate for a better deal.  I'll keep fighting for a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a compromise, and it's getting closer to Bob's last offer. I hope he recognizes the urgency of reaching an agreement before we lose even more money to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really hitting hard now, and there's a high risk of ending up with nothing. While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances. It's time to end this negotiation and secure something before we lose it all."
