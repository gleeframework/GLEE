{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 6000 and Bob 4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should go 60/40, but in my favor this time. It's a fair trade, wouldn't you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair that Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation and give himself a larger share of the money. I'd like to make a new proposal that's more balanced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
