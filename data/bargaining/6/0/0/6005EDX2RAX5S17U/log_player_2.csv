"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  A fair deal for us both to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about inflation, but my offer is the most reasonable. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take a slightly lower share than to risk getting nothing at all with further rounds and inflation."
