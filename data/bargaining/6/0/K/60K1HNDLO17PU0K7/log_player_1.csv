"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $999,000 and leave Bob with $1,000. It's a big difference, but I'm aiming for the majority of the money. Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though I get less than I initially wanted, I'm accepting this offer.  The inflation means that my share is significantly reduced in the next round, and it's better to get something now than risk getting nothing at all."
