"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $600,000, which is 60% of the total amount, and let Bob have $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the proposal, suggesting that a 60-40 split is a fair division, considering the progressive devaluation of the money for both players but slightly favoring myself for making the first offer. This division acknowledges the greater reduction in value for Bob in subsequent rounds, aiming to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both parties and prevent further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, considering the money will be worth less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer because, despite the decrease in value due to inflation, accepting 45% of the total amount seems less favorable compared to my initial proposal of taking 60%. Given the progressive devaluation, there's still room to negotiate for a better split before the money loses even more value in subsequent rounds. By rejecting, I aim to pressure Bob into reconsidering or to make a counteroffer that might be more in my favor, especially since Bob faces a higher rate of devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\nIn this revised offer, I propose to take $580,000 and let Bob have $420,000. The message suggests meeting closer to the middle ground, acknowledging the impact of inflation on both our potential gains but still leveraging the fact that Bob's share devalues more significantly. This adjustment aims to be more palatable to Bob while maximizing my gain, recognizing that further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for both of us, but more so for Bob. By making this offer, I aim to find a compromise that Bob might accept, considering the increasing loss in value if we proceed to further rounds."
