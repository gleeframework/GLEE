"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he accepts and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  I'm hoping this will establish trust and avoid a long, drawn-out negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get a substantial amount, and the inflation risk is too high to continue negotiating. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances."
