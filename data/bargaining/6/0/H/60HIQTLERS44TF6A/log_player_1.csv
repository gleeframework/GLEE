"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 600,000$ and Bob 400,000$. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation risk, Bob's proposal is actually a more favorable split for me, since my gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, while Bob's gain is worth 10% less. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
