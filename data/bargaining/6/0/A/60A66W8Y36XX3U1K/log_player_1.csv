"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'm not sure if I want to give up a larger share of the money, especially since I'm not sure how much more inflation will affect the money in future rounds.

For now, I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.
```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the previous rounds, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that Bob is trying to get a larger share. I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself.

Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
I'm offering a 55-45 split, trying to balance the previous offers and keep a slight advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain! With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, I feel like I'm getting a better deal. The 45-55 split is actually more favorable for me than my previous offer, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain.

I'll accept this offer.
