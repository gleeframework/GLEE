Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one. Bob's offer is very lopsided, and even with the inflation, I'm still losing a lot. I'm going to try to hold out and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to try and entice Bob. With each round, the value of the money is diminishing, so it's important to strike a balance between being fair and getting a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. Even with the inflation, I'm still losing a substantial portion of the money.  I'm going to hold out and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to offer an even split. The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I need to secure a fair share before things get worse.  It's time for compromise!"
