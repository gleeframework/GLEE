"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round. I'm hoping to exploit the inflation factor and get a large share, knowing that the value of Bob's portion will decrease more significantly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share,  accepting Bob's offer in round 2 is the best strategic move.  

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My potential gains will continue to shrink with each round.  
* **Fairness:** This offer is a relatively fair split, and further negotiation could risk getting nothing at all.
* **Risk Aversion:**  While I could try to push for more, there's a chance Bob will reject future offers, and the money could be lost entirely.  

It's better to secure a substantial share now than risk a losing outcome later."
