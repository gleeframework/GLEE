"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we start with a 65/35 split in my favor.  It's a generous offer considering the inflation working against you, and we both walk away with something substantial. Let's wrap this up quickly!

# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we need to find a middle ground. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a significant shift from my previous offer. This accounts for the inflation hitting you harder and still gives us both a good deal. Let's settle this now.
