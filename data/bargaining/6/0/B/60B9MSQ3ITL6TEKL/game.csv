650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I propose we start with a 65/35 split in my favor.  It's a generous offer considering the inflation working against you, and we both walk away with something substantial. Let's wrap this up quickly!",Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to give you 40% of the money to secure a quick agreement. This is a fair share given the inflation we'll both experience in future rounds.  Let's end this now and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, it seems like we need to find a middle ground. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a significant shift from my previous offer. This accounts for the inflation hitting you harder and still gives us both a good deal. Let's settle this now.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to increase my offer to 55% for you.  We're both losing money with each round, and this seems like a fair compromise. Let's wrap this up before the inflation gets even worse.",Bob,4,

575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, this back and forth is costing us both money. I'm proposing 57.5% for me and 42.5% for you.  This is a compromise that acknowledges the inflation working against you while still providing us both with a fair share. Let's be sensible and end this here.",Alice,5,
