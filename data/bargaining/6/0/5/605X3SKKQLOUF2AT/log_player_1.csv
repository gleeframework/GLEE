"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $6,000 in Round 2 is actually worth less than my gain of $8,000 in Round 1. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, considering the inflation effect, my gain of $6,000 in Round 2 is worth less than my gain of $8,000 in Round 1. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation effect, my gain of $7,000 in Round 3 is worth only about $3,600 in terms of the original purchasing power. In this context, Bob's offer of $5,000 for me seems reasonable, as it's still a 50-50 split, which is a fair division considering the reduced value of money.
