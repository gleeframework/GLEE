"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, my gain of $6,000 is worth 80% of $8,000 (my gain in the first round), which is $6,400. And Bob's gain of $4,000 is worth 90% of $4,200 (his gain in the first round), which is $3,780.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
