Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money into 75-25 split. This might seem a bit lopsided now, but consider the risk of inflation and the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the risk of inflation, I propose a 60-40 split. This maintains a reasonable difference while still providing Bob with a significant portion of the funds. We can adjust our strategy based on future offers. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
