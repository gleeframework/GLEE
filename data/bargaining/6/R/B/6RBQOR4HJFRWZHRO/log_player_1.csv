"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can work together!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40, which seems like a fair starting point."
