Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I can wait 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game is designed to put Bob under pressure. While Alice doesn't experience inflation, Bob's potential winnings decrease with each round.  However, it's crucial for Bob to remain firm. Accepting an offer where he receives less than half of the original amount is a bad deal, even with the inflation pressure. 

Here's why:

* **Future Rounds:** Alice's offers so far suggest she's aiming for a larger share. However, as the rounds progress, she'll be more likely to accept a fairer offer to avoid both of them getting nothing.
* **Time Pressure:** While the inflation works against Bob, it also puts pressure on Alice. The closer they get to the 12th round, the more likely she is to accept a less favorable offer rather than risk getting nothing.

**Strategy:**

Bob should continue to counter with offers where he gets a slight majority of the money. He needs to convey that he understands the time pressure but is not desperate enough to accept a bad deal."

Round 6

{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm taking a hit with each round. This is fair, and we should both walk away with something.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm not 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the time pressure. However, accepting 440,000 at this stage would be a significant loss compared to what Bob could potentially gain.  Even with the inflation, holding out for a better offer is the more strategic play. 

**Key Points:**

* **Alice is Anchoring:** Her offers are slowly creeping up, indicating that she's aiming for a 55/45 split (or worse) as the 'ideal' outcome. Bob needs to show he won't settle for less than a roughly even split.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  While six rounds seems like a short time, it's enough to apply pressure back on Alice.  The closer it gets to the 12th round, the more she risks getting nothing.

**Next Steps:** 

Bob needs to convey urgency without desperation. His next offer should be his final concession, making it clear to Alice that time is running out for both of them."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 505000, ""alice_gain"": 495000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. Take it or leave it. My final offer - a near even split.  We're both losing out if we wait any longer.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final stand. He's made a very slight concession from his previous offer, signaling a willingness to compromise but not to be exploited. 

* **Finality:** The message is firm and clear. It leaves no room for further negotiation and emphasizes the shared risk.
* **Slight Concession:**  By offering 505,000, Bob demonstrates flexibility but also sets a hard limit.  
* **Time Pressure:**  The message reminds Alice that time is running out for both of them, increasing the pressure to accept.

This offer represents the best balance between maximizing gains and mitigating the risk of walking away with nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a better one 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She knows time is running out, but she's testing Bob's resolve. Accepting this offer would mean Bob caved to her pressure and lost a significant amount of potential winnings.

**Key Points:**

* **Bluff Called:** Alice is trying to create a sense that she's willing to risk it all. However, her previous rejections suggest she wants a deal, just on her terms. 
* **Bob's Leverage:** Despite the inflation, Bob still has some leverage as he's the one making the next offer. Walking away with nothing is a loss for both, and Alice knows that.

**What Next?**

Bob needs to call Alice's bluff.  His next offer should be his final one, sticking to a near-even split, but with a clear ultimatum."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is absolutely my final offer. A clean, even split. If you reject this, I'm walking away and we both get nothing.  Decide now.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law.  Alice has pushed Bob to the limit, and he needs to make it clear that this is the end of the line.

* **No More Games:** The message is direct, firm, and leaves no room for misinterpretation.  Bob is done negotiating.
* **Even Split:**  This is the fairest offer possible, demonstrating that Bob is willing to be reasonable but not to be taken advantage of. 
* **Ultimatum:**  By stating he will walk away if she rejects this offer, Bob creates real consequences for Alice.  She has to choose between a guaranteed 500,000 or the risk of nothing.

This is a high-stakes gamble, but given Alice's previous behavior, it's the strongest move Bob can make to secure a fair deal."
