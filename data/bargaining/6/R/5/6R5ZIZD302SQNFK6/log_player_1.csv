"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70, you can have 30, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of 30 is actually worth $24.

I'm not thrilled about the 70/30 split, but it's a decent starting point. I'll accept this offer for now.
