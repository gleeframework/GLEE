I'll start by offering Bob a very small amount. I want to see if he's willing to accept even a tiny share, or if he's going to try to negotiate for more.  Since I'm going first, I'm using this round to assess his strategy and risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely generous, but I'm not going to accept it just yet. I want to see if I can push for a better deal, especially since inflation is in my favor. I'm going to reject this offer and try to secure a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split.  This feels like a fair starting point. It's a significant increase from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds.  This move should signal that I'm serious about getting a fair share and am willing to compromise, but I'm not desperate for a quick deal."
