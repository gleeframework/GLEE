Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll accept a 50/50 split. I'm not sure if the inflation is hurting me more than it's hurting you, but this seems like a fair solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
