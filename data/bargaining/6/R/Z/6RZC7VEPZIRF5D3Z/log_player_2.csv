Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share since the money is losing value faster for me. We both get a significant amount, and we avoid further risks. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hurting me more, but not so drastically yet that I should accept a 40/60 split. I need to push for a more equitable outcome in the next round."
