"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive rounds. This offer gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, it's crucial to consider the inflation. In the next round, I'll be the one making the proposal, and I can offer Alice a slightly better deal while still getting a significant share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This offer gives you a chance to gain something before the inflation hits too hard.  Accepting this means we both get something, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing at all.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm serious about getting a fair deal. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure and the impact of inflation on my potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant sum, especially with the inflation factor. It's a risk-averse move, but a reasonable one given the circumstances."
