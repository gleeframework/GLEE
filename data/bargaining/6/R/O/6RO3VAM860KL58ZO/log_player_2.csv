Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 30% is too low. Let's split it 40/60, I get 40% and you get 60%. It's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40
