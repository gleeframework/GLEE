Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is really hurting your share now. I'm being generous by not taking more. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a tough call, but considering the inflation and Alice's final offer statement, it's probably best to accept.  While the deal is not as good as the initial offer, it's better than risking getting a worse deal in the next round."
