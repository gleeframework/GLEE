Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting desperate, but I'll only give in a little 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but I need to accept this offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing me:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round *for me*.  Waiting any longer means I'll get even less.
* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's consistently rejected offers close to even and seems content to drag this out. 
* **Something is better than nothing:**  While 43 is a bad deal compared to earlier rounds, it's better than risking getting even less or nothing at all if we reach a point where any potential offer is heavily impacted by inflation."
