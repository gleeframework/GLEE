"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer from Bob.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll factor that in when making my decision.

The offer is:
```
# Alice gain: 300000 (worth 95% of the initial amount)
# Bob gain: 700000 (worth the same as the initial amount)
```

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather have a higher share of the initial amount, considering the inflation effect. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation that has already occurred. Since the money is worth 10% less than the initial amount (5% less in each of the first two rounds), I'll aim to maximize my share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm offering to take 55% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer from Bob.

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I'll factor that in when making my decision.

The offer is:
```
# Alice gain: 400000 (worth 85.74% of the initial amount)
# Bob gain: 600000 (worth the same as the initial amount)
```

I'll accept this offer because the money I gain is still a significant portion of the initial amount, considering the inflation effect.
