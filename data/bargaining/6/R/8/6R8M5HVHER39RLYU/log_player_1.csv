"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  This is to try and establish a good relationship and hopefully get the deal done quickly.  The risk is that Bob might be greedy and think he can get more in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less generous than my initial offer, and it seems he's trying to take advantage of the inflation factor. I'm going to reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate more fairly in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower amount than my initial offer, but still a generous share.  I believe this shows flexibility while still trying to secure a favorable outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse. I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'll see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm still trying to be fair. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the inflation eats away at his share even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable. It seems he's trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm going to continue rejecting his offers, hoping that he'll eventually see the value in a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

With each round, the value of the money is diminishing significantly. I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still trying to secure a considerable share. At this point, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting Bob's offers, and I need to find a balance between securing a good deal and avoiding losing everything to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable, and I am not willing to accept such a small share. Even with the inflation, I believe that I can still secure a better outcome for myself by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to try and meet Bob halfway, but still aiming for a significant share. It's getting risky to keep rejecting, but I believe I can still secure a better outcome than the last few offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unacceptable.  While the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I'm not going to accept such a small share, especially since Bob's offers have been consistently greedy. I'm still hoping for a more equitable split and I'll try again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only two rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is high. I'm going to propose a 50/50 split, acknowledging the rapidly decreasing value of the money.  It's a fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
