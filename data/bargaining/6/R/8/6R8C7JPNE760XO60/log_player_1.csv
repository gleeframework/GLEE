"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 10% decrease in value for you each round, I suggest we divide it 55-45. This way, you still get a significant portion, and we both avoid further devaluation risks. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
