"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering you $3,000, and I'll take $7,000. It's a good starting point, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, my proposal from Round 1 is now less attractive.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
