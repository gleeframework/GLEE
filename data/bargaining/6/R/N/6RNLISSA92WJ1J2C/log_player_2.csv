Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me.  While my options are dwindling, accepting this offer would mean I've lost almost 20% of the potential value compared to the start. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law.  Offering anything less than a 50/50 split at this point will likely result in Alice continuing to chip away at my potential gains.  By framing this as my ""final offer"" I'm hoping to signal I'm serious, and a 50/50 split is still objectively fair for both of us."
