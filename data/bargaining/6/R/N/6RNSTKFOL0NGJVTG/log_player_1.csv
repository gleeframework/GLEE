"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here it is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
