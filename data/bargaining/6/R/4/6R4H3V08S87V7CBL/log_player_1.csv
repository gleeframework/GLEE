"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us right now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split was a bit too generous towards you. How about we meet closer to the middle with this offer? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 58,
""bob_gain"": 42,
""message"": ""I understand you want something closer to the middle, but keep in mind the money is losing value for me with each round. This is my final offer above 55.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet closer to your previous offer, but it needs to be a bit more balanced. This seems fair considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 53 
# Bob gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is taking advantage of the situation and knows time pressure will lead me to accept a less favorable offer.  I'm willing to push it a little further, but I need to be prepared to accept a smaller gain in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 54,
""bob_gain"": 46,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm taking a significant hit with the inflation. This is my final offer.""
