Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's compromise, this is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Alice decides. I'm ready for the next round!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it - it's getting expensive for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take the 4200 dollars. It's better than risking another round and losing even more value to inflation."
