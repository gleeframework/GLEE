"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, and I'll take $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of $40 is actually worth $32 in terms of purchasing power. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's not as favorable as my original proposal. But it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being worth even less.
