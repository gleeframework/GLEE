"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $450,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation effect. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain of $450,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $405,000.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.
