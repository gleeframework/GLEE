Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 

I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000.  I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives me the majority of the money but still gives Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. I believe I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm willing to reduce my share a bit from my first offer, but I still think I should get the larger share.  $7000 for me and $3000 for Bob seems like a reasonable compromise."
