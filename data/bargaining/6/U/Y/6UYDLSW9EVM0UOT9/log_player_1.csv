"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. No need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not being too generous yet. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 95% of $200,000, which is $190,000. Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 80% of $1,000,000, which is $800,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less. I'll accept Bob's offer.
