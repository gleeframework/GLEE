"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the majority, but you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to see what Alice will propose in the next round. There's a good chance she'll offer more to keep the money from depreciating too much."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""I think a 40/60 split is fair considering we have 12 rounds to go.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I think a 70/30 split is more reasonable considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is worse than her previous one, considering inflation. There's a chance she'll lower her demands in the next round as the money continues to lose value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Let's compromise.  I'll increase my offer slightly, but time is running out. We both need to get a fair share before the money loses too much value.""
}
