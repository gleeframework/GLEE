"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the money, which is $70, and leaving 30% for Bob, which is $30. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'm hoping that in the next round, I can get an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 65% of the money, which is $65, and leaving 35% for Bob, which is $35. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we meet in the middle and compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice, and hope you'll accept this time! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. With the money being worth so much less, I'm willing to settle for 55% of the reduced value, which is $55, rather than risking it all and potentially getting nothing."
