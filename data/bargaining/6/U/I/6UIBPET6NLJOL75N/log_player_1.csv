"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the total. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with a fair split, but I think I can do better than that. This way, I get a bit more, but it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is worth 80% of its original value, or $160,000. Bob's gain of $800,000 is still worth $800,000.

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting a significantly lower share than in the previous round, despite the inflation.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my previous offer of $600,000 was worth $480,000 in the second round. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you more, but I need a bit more myself to make it worth my while. This is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. I'm willing to give you a small amount, but I'm taking the majority of the pie. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $450,000 in the third round is worth $225,000 in the fourth round. Bob's gain of $550,000 is still worth $550,000.

Considering the decreasing value of my share, I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing.
