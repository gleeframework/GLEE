"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering him a bit less than half, while still being somewhat reasonable to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split.  Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait and try to get a better deal. Bob, on the other hand, is losing value each round, so I'll reject this offer in hopes of getting a more favorable split in the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to take advantage of Bob's decreasing gains due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! Here's my new proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to appear more reasonable by offering a compromise, but still aiming to gain more than Bob. Let's see how he reacts!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I'll make a new proposal in this round. Since I already sent it, I'll just repeat it:\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob reacts to this offer! I'm trying to appear more reasonable while still gaining more than him. The pressure of inflation is on him, so I'm hoping he'll accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly and be done with it.  Inflation is going to hurt us both if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, but I know that due to inflation, his gain is actually worth 14.26% less than the original value. Since my gain doesn't lose value, I'm effectively getting more than half of the original value if I accept this offer.\n\n###\n\nConsidering this, I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a good deal for me. I'll end the game here and take the $50, which is worth the same as in the first round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
