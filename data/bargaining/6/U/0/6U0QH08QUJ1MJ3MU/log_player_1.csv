I'm going to be greedy in the first round and offer Bob just $1. I know the inflation will hurt me if we go many rounds, but I want to get as much as possible right away!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would love to get more, 500,000 is still a significant amount of money.  It's not worth risking getting nothing at all by continuing to play."
