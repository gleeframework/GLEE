"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. The message is a friendly introduction to the game, suggesting we can discuss and adjust the split if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, my effective gain is 54 (60 - 6, which is 10% of 60).

I don't like the 50-50 split, as it's not in my favor. I'd like to negotiate further.

```

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
