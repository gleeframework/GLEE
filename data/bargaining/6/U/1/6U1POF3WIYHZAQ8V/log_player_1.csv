"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and reasonable ratio. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob will take 30%. This is a reasonable ratio, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a small share. Your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'll have to be more aggressive in my counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a counteroffer: 450000 for me, 550000 for you. It's a better deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the current $800,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I think it's a more reasonable compromise. Your turn again, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is still eating away at my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced amount, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a large share, but I need to protect my interests. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 30% of the current $800,000, which is a significant compromise. However, I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good opportunity for him to get a large share, and he'll accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take the crumbs! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting desperate indeed. However, I'm not ready to give up yet. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think I'm getting desperate? I'm just being smart! I'll give you a counteroffer: 250000 for me, 750000 for you. It's the last chance for a decent deal, Bob.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 25% of the current $900,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offers, but I'm hoping Bob will see that it's still a better deal than the crumbs he's offering."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings now!

Considering the reduced amount, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 150000,
  ""bob_gain"": 850000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of time and options. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 15% of the current $900,000, which is a very small share, but I'm hoping Bob will see that it's better than getting nothing."
