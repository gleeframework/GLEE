"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm offering to take 80 dollars, leaving Bob with 20 dollars. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, this offer is a bit more skewed towards Bob's gain.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has been going on for two rounds, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money I gain in this round being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be careful.

However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a relatively fair deal considering the circumstances. I'll decide to accept this offer.
