Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is right that her offer is worth less due to inflation, it's still skewed in her favor from Bob's perspective. Bob needs to hold out for a better deal and emphasize the shrinking pot. Each round that passes makes a deal where Bob gets less than $5,000 increasingly risky."
