I'm going to reject this offer. It's better to see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is better than my previous offer, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round.  Plus, the inflation makes it riskier to keep going.  I'll accept."
