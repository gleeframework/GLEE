"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split. You get a small share now, but with each round, the money is worth less for me, so in the end, it's better for both of us if we agree now.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  It's the fairest way to go, and we both get a decent amount before inflation kicks in too much. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
