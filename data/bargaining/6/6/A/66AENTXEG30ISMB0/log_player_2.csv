Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a larger share than 40%. I propose a 55/45 split, which is closer to fair and allows us both to gain something before the money depreciates further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 55/45 split in Round 3 is a strategically sound decision for Bob. Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:**  The most crucial factor is the decreasing value of the money, particularly for Alice. Her potential gains are shrinking faster. Delaying further only hurts her more.
* **Fairness:** While Bob desires a larger share, 55/45 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly better than the initial 90/10 and shows Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Risk of Further Rejection:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will propose a better split in subsequent rounds.  She might become more insistent on a larger share, especially as her potential gains shrink.

By accepting, Bob secures a decent portion of the money before the effects of inflation further erode the deal's value.
