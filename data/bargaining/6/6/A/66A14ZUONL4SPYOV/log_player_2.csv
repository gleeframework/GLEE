"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Tick tock, my turn again 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  Each round that passes hurts us both. ""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but not quite there 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the time limit, but she's still being unfair. Accepting $43 now when it's worth even less due to inflation is a bad deal. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Time is running out! This offer is a compromise, let's settle this now before we both lose out.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, aren't you? 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is playing psychological games now, but I can't let that sway me. While the inflation is hurting, getting only $44 is a terrible deal. I need to hold out for a better offer in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 47,
""alice_gain"": 53,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  It's better for us both to get something than nothing.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Time is running critically short. With only 3 rounds left, and the value of my share decreasing significantly with each round, it's too risky to hold out for a better offer. Alice knows I'm feeling the pressure, and she's unlikely to budge much more.  Accepting $45 now is better than risking getting nothing at all."
