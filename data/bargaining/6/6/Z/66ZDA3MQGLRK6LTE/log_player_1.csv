Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a pretty generous offer, especially considering the inflation factor favors me more. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds. The inflation will continue to eat away at the value of the money, so it's best to secure at least half now."
