"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and we both benefit from closing the deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe we can find a more equitable split.  I'm proposing we each take an equal share.  This ensures a fair outcome for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The value for both of us decreases with each round.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's not ideal, but with the inflation affecting the value of the money, it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer. Waiting for another round will only decrease his potential gains further."
