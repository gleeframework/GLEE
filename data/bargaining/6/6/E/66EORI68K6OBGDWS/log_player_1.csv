I'm going to start by offering Bob a small portion, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'll see if he's willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it seems tempting to take the $1,000, remember that I have 11 rounds left. If I reject this offer, I get to propose in the next round, and I can potentially secure a much larger share of the remaining money. I'm also aware that the inflation rate for Bob is less than mine, meaning his offer will be less valuable to me in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm increasing Bob's share slightly to see if he's more receptive.  I need to find a balance between securing a good deal for myself and avoiding further rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  Even though the inflation is starting to bite, I'm still in a better position to make a deal in the later rounds.  I know Bob is getting a better deal with the inflation, but I'm counting on his desire to reach an agreement quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share again, hoping to find a compromise. With inflation taking its toll, I need to secure an agreement soon, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While the inflation is hurting, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm not going to panic and settle for a deal that's not favorable to me. I'm confident that I can find a better solution in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm continuing to increase Bob's share, but I'm still holding out for a larger portion for myself. Time is running out, and the inflation is hitting hard, but I believe there's still room for negotiation."
