"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, giving you $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  It's a fair starting point that gives me a good chunk of the money while leaving something for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a risky move for Bob.  He's basically flipped our offer, and while I'm still getting something, it's a lot less. I'm not willing to settle for such a small amount.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share by $100,000, but still offering Bob a significant amount.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't be taken advantage of."
