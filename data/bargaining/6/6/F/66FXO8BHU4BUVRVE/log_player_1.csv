"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Take the low offer, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can get to the next round before the inflation sets in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept it since it's a fair split, and we're getting closer to the deadline. Plus, it's better than waiting for the next round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
