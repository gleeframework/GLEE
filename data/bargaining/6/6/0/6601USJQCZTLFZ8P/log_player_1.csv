"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

In this case, Bob's offer is:

Alice gain: 5000 * 0.8 (20% less) = 4000
Bob gain: 5000 * 0.95 (5% less) = 4750

Considering the inflation effect, I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous for me. I'll reject it for now.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risk of inflation.""
}"
