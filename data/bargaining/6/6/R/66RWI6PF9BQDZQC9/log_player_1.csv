"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more fair split, as I'm taking on the risk of inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll reject this offer since it's the same as my original proposal, and I'd like to negotiate further. I'll make a new offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share to account for the risk of inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this 50-50. It's the fairest option, considering the inflation risk. We can end this game now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting desperate!

I'll accept this offer since it's a 50-50 split, and it's a fair compromise considering the inflation risk. I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in future rounds, so I'll take this opportunity to end the game.
