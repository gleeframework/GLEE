"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll need to consider that when making my decision.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40 for me and 60 for him, and the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```"
