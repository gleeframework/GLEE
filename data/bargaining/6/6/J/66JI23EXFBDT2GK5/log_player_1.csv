"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 90/10 split.  It seems like a fair starting point given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is making this offer more appealing. It's likely that Bob will take a bigger share in future rounds, so I'm better off accepting now."
