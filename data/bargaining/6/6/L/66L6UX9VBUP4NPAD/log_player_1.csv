"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting we start with an even split to see how the game goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a fair start 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, I'd rather not take a smaller share, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up all the power yet.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly smaller share to myself this time, but still keeping some advantage. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to catch up with me! Considering the significant decrease in value of my potential gain, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. However, I'm not willing to give up 40% of the total amount, so I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5

}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob this time, but still trying to maintain a decent portion for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
