Alice's offer:

This is a terrible offer for Bob. While it's better than nothing, the potential for a much larger share exists. It's worth exploring other options."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a much better offer than the first round, it's still not a fair share. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better split.  There's still a lot of time left, and inflation is working against Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a reasonable offer. While it's less than I initially wanted, the inflation is taking a serious toll. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all, and this offer secures a significant portion of the money."
