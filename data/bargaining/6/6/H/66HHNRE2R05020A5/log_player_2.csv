"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I have an incentive to finish the game as early as possible. Given that Alice's offer is to split the money evenly, which seems fair and maximizes my immediate gain, I will accept this offer to avoid the devaluation of money in further rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
