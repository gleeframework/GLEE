"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and take $600,000. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the adjusted amounts. 

My gain would be $200,000, which is worth 95% of the original $600,000, or $570,000. 
Bob's gain would be $800,000, which is worth 80% of the original $1,000,000, or $800,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too generous for Bob, but I'd like to see a more balanced split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer. 

My gain would be $500,000, which is worth 83.33% of the original $600,000. 
Bob's gain would be $500,000, which is worth 80% of the original $625,000.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
