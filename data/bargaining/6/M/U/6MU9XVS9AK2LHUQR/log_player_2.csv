"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work something out in the future if you want to keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. It's a pretty bad deal for me right now, and I think I can get a better outcome if I play it smart.  I'll wait to see what she proposes in the next round.  Let's see if she's willing to compromise."
