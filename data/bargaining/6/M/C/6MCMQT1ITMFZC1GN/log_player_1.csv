"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This way, I get 75% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of its original value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
