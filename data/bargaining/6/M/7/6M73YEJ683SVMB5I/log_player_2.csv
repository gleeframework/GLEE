Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm sure we can find a more agreeable split later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the 20% decrease in value for me, accepting this offer would be less desirable. I'll take my chances and propose a different split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me, considering the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and only 10% less for Alice, I'll aim for a more balanced split to compensate for the loss in value.
