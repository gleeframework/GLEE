"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5250,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to maximize our gains before inflation 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I could try for a slightly better deal in the next round, Bob's offer is fair and waiting any longer will only result in both of us losing money to inflation."
