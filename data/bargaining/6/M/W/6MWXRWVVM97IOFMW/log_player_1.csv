"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is 20$. I'm keeping the remaining 80% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 32
* Bob gain: 48

I'm not thrilled with the 60-40 split, but it's a better offer than the last one. I'll accept it.
