Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to stick with my previous offer of 60/40. Time is ticking, and the value is decreasing for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time with this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to settle this quickly. I'm coming down to 58/42, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting 42 dollars now is better than risking getting a worse offer from Alice and getting closer to the deadline where we both get nothing.
