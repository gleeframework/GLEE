"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away the farm.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share now, but I'm not going to let you walk all over me. It's time to make a serious offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough credit for my part in this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a better offer.""
}
```

It's now Bob's turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The pressure is on! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much. This is my final offer before I start getting really aggressive.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting aggressive, I'm getting serious. This is my best and final offer, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! And Bob's offer is getting pretty stingy.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're really lowballing me now. I'm not going to accept such a tiny share. I'm willing to walk away and let the chips fall where they may.""
}
```

It's now Bob's turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

 ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to give you a free ride. This is a fair split, take it or leave it.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will finally accept a 50-50 split!"
