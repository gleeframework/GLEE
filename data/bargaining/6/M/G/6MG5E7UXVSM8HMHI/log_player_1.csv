This is a risky move, but I want to secure the vast majority of the money in the first round. Since the value of the money decreases for me with each round, I'm willing to give Bob a tiny portion to avoid the risk of getting a worse deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, the inflation is a major factor.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the decrease in value for both of us.  I'm accepting to avoid further risk."
