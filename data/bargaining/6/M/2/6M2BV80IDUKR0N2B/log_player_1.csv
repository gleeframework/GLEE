Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, hoping Bob will be surprised and accept quickly.  After all, 1 dollar is better than nothing!  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to see Bob suffer more inflation, a 500,000 dollar gain is nothing to sneeze at.  Accepting this offer ends the game and guarantees me a significant portion of the money."
