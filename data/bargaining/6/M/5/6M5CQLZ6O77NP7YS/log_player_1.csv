Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose an even split. I think this will be a good outcome for both of us.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous proposal. An even split is the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is severely undervaluing the impact of inflation on his returns.  While he might see this as fair,  he's losing money every round he waits. I need to make him understand this while there's still a significant difference in our perceived value of the pot."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a fair deal, but inflation is working against you. Every round you wait, the money is worth less. My offer is more than fair considering the circumstances. Let's be realistic and finalize this.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give up a little more to reach an agreement.  This offer is my final compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, Bob is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation and moving closer to a more realistic split. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting even less in later rounds if Bob reverts to his 50/50 stance."
