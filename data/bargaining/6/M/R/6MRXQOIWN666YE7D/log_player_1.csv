"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which I think is a generous offer considering I don't know how the inflation will affect the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness in the first round, but I think we can both do better. Let's flip the offer this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Bob wants to flip the offer, giving him the majority of the money. Considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain, I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give you the majority of the money, especially with inflation affecting your gain!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to give me $400,000, I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a flip, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the remaining money, which I think is a reasonable ask considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's cut to the chase.  I think we can both do better than the last few rounds.  This is my final offer.  Accept and we'll both come out ahead! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting aggressive! With inflation affecting his gain by 27.1%, I'm not sure I want to give him the majority of the money.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give you the majority of the money, especially with inflation affecting your gain so heavily!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting intense! Since Bob's offer was to give me $300,000, I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'm taking control!""
}
```

This offer gives me 85% of the remaining money, which I think is a strong ask considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain."
