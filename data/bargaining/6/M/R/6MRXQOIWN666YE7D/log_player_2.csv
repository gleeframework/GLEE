Let's see what Alice proposes next.  While this is a decent offer, I want to see if I can get more.  After all, there's inflation to consider!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the first round, but I think we can both do better. Let's flip the offer this time!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You wanted a flip, but I'm not giving up too much! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting worse, even though she's claiming it's ""fair.""  I'm not giving up yet!  I need to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's cut to the chase.  I think we can both do better than the last few rounds.  This is my final offer.  Accept and we'll both come out ahead!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking control! 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one.  Alice is definitely taking advantage of the inflation, and her offer is pretty bad. But, the next round my money will be worth even less, and there's no guarantee she'll offer anything better. I'm going to accept to minimize my losses."
