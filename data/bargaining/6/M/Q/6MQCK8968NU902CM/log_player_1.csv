"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both walk away with a decent sum!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can avoid the inflation that will erode the value of the money over the rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* My gain: $9,000
* Bob's gain: $9,000 x 0.9 = $8,100

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50/50 split, considering I could potentially get more if I wait and make a counteroffer. I'll reject this offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50/50 split, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 10% less for him. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping he'll accept quickly before he realizes he can get more in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! I'll give you a smaller share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* My gain: $9,000
* Bob's gain: $9,000 x 0.7279 = $6,570.10

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I could potentially get more if I wait and make a counteroffer. However, Bob's message suggests he's trying to be more generous this time. I'll consider it.
