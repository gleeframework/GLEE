"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Take 60 and I'll take 40. It's a fair split, considering the first round's rejection. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
