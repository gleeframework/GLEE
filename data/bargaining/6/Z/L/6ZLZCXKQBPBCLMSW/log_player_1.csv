# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need at least 55 to make it worthwhile with the inflation.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is quite generous. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is getting pretty serious, and Bob's offer is close to my previous offer. Accepting ensures I get something, even if it's less than ideal."
