"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less each round, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, I also don't want to reject the offer and risk getting even less in the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
