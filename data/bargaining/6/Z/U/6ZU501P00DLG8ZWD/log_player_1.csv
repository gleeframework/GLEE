Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split of 9000 for myself and 1000 for Bob.  It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I figure it's worth a shot to see if he'll accept it in the first round. I'm hoping he'll be willing to take something rather than risk getting nothing if he rejects and the money inflates further in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more than 5000, considering the inflation, my share is worth less than it was in round 1. Taking 5000 now is better than risking a worse offer next round."
