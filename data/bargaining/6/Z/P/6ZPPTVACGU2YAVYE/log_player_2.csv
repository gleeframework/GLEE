Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my shrinking pot.  While her offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away, otherwise, she'll keep lowballing me as the rounds progress."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. She knows the deal is only getting worse for me due to inflation.  I'm conceding slightly to make it seem like a compromise, even though it's still in my best interest to take this deal before the inflation eats away more of my potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I'm likely to get in the remaining rounds. Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, and I need to cut my losses before the deal gets even worse.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better to walk away with something than nothing at all."
