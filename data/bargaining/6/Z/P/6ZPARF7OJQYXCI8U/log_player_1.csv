Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split that favors me, but still gives Bob a small amount. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as the inflation will hurt him more if we go to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $7200 for myself, but still giving Bob a significant portion. This is a compromise to account for the inflation, but I believe it's a fair offer that will hopefully entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. While Bob is offering more than the previous round, it's still not a fair deal considering the significant inflation. I believe I can secure a better outcome if we continue."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5760, ""bob_gain"": 4240}
```

I'm offering a compromise again, taking into account the significant inflation. While I'm taking a bigger hit than before, I still believe this is a fair offer that reflects the current value of the money. This is my last offer; I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it."
