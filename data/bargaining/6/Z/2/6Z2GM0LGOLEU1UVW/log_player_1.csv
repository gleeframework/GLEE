"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $40 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $38.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since his offer is still a 60/40 split, and he's asking for a split in his favor, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 90% of its original value due to inflation. My gain is now worth 90% of $38, which is $34.40.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
