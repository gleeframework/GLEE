This is a tough one! While it's frustrating, Bob is exploiting the game's rules and my increasingly unfavorable position. 

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time Pressure:** The longer the game goes, the less my potential earnings are worth. I need to cut my losses.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse. It's unlikely he'll suddenly propose something more generous.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk of ending up with even less in a later round. Accepting guarantees me something, even if it's not ideal."
