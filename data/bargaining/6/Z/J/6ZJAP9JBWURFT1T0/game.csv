6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this division is fair and gives us both a good starting point.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to take a bit more than half, considering the inflation rate affects you more. This way, we both still get a significant amount, but I'm taking into account the future value of the money.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, I understand your point about the inflation difference, but your offer was too far in your favor. This is a more balanced proposal considering the future value for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect this. My new offer still allows you to walk away with a substantial amount, but it also acknowledges the decreasing value of the money, particularly on your end. I believe this division is more in line with the current state of our negotiations.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and the money is losing value quickly. I'm sticking to a split that leans more towards me to compensate for the inflation disparity, but this is a compromise to get us both a decent outcome.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"We're past the halfway point, and the value of the money is dropping fast, especially for you. I'm adjusting my offer to reflect this reality. Given the significant loss in value on your end, I believe this split is more reasonable and acknowledges the urgency of the situation. It's time for us to be realistic about the worth of the money we're negotiating over.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you a larger share than you'd get if we split evenly after the next round of inflation.  Take the deal now before we both lose out even more.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"We're running out of time, and the value of the money is plummeting, especially for you. Given the current state of inflation, I'm making a final push for a larger share. This offer still gives you a chance to walk away with something, but it's time for us to acknowledge the reality of the situation. The value disparity between our shares is too great to ignore, and I believe this split reflects that.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, this is it.  We're both getting hurt now. I'm taking a significant hit with this offer, acknowledging the inflation disparity, but it's the best I can do.  Let's end this before we get nothing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"We're at the final stretch, and the value of the money is almost negligible for you. I'm making one last offer, taking into account the extreme inflation disparity. This is my best and final proposal, and I believe it's the most realistic split considering the circumstances. If you reject this, we'll both walk away with nothing, which would be a shame. Let's end this with a deal.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Bob, don't be greedy.  This is our last chance to walk away with anything.  If you reject this, we BOTH get ZERO.  Think about it.",Alice,11,
