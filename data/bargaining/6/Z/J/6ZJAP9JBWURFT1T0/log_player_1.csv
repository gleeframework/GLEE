# Alice gain: 4500

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect this. My new offer still allows you to walk away with a substantial amount, but it also acknowledges the decreasing value of the money, particularly on your end. I believe this division is more in line with the current state of our negotiations.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're past the halfway point, and the value of the money is dropping fast, especially for you. I'm adjusting my offer to reflect this reality. Given the significant loss in value on your end, I believe this split is more reasonable and acknowledges the urgency of the situation. It's time for us to be realistic about the worth of the money we're negotiating over. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using the shrinking pot as leverage against me, but he's not offering enough to make it worth accepting his increasingly one-sided offers. The pace of devaluation is hurting me faster, but I still have some leverage.  I need to push back strongly to signal I'm willing to risk it all."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you a larger share than you'd get if we split evenly after the next round of inflation.  Take the deal now before we both lose out even more.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a power move.  I'm making a final offer that's actually in Bob's favor if he considers the upcoming devaluation. This highlights the urgency and puts the pressure on him to accept a deal before greed makes him lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, and the value of the money is plummeting, especially for you. Given the current state of inflation, I'm making a final push for a larger share. This offer still gives you a chance to walk away with something, but it's time for us to acknowledge the reality of the situation. The value disparity between our shares is too great to ignore, and I believe this split reflects that. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I have to call Bob's bluff. He's clearly trying to strong-arm me with the shrinking pot, but his offer is getting insultingly low. By rejecting this, I'm signaling that I'm willing to risk it all going to zero rather than accept a terrible deal. This might be my last chance to get him to move significantly towards a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it.  We're both getting hurt now. I'm taking a significant hit with this offer, acknowledging the inflation disparity, but it's the best I can do.  Let's end this before we get nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make a serious concession to avoid disaster. I'm accepting a smaller share than I believe is fair, but it's still significantly more than Bob's last offer.  The message emphasizes the urgency and frames the offer as a loss for me, making it more palatable for Bob to accept.  This might be our last chance for a reasonable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're at the final stretch, and the value of the money is almost negligible for you. I'm making one last offer, taking into account the extreme inflation disparity. This is my best and final proposal, and I believe it's the most realistic split considering the circumstances. If you reject this, we'll both walk away with nothing, which would be a shame. Let's end this with a deal. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is pure brinkmanship from Bob, but I can't accept this insulting offer.  Even with only two rounds left, accepting would set a terrible precedent and show I'm willing to fold under pressure. I'm betting Bob doesn't want to walk away with nothing either, so I'm calling his bluff.  It's incredibly risky, but it's my only chance to salvage a less terrible deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""message"": ""Bob, don't be greedy.  This is our last chance to walk away with anything.  If you reject this, we BOTH get ZERO.  Think about it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final push. Bob needs to understand the gravity of the situation. I'm giving him a significantly larger share, acknowledging the inflation impact, but it's still something rather than nothing. This message removes any pretense of negotiation and lays out the stark reality: accept this offer or we both lose. It's a high-stakes gamble, but with one round left, it's the only play to avoid a complete loss."
