**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal now is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob knows I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, making it unlikely he'll offer a better deal in the future. He's holding firm at a slightly advantageous split. 
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee what Bob might offer in subsequent rounds. It's possible he'll dig in his heels and offer even less favorable terms.

Accepting this offer cuts my losses and ensures a reasonable, if not ideal, payout."
