"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good deal of money. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is tempting, it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal.  Let's see if Alice is willing to compromise more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eroding our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the sentiment of an even split, Bob, but time is money.  My offer still ensures you get a sizable amount before inflation eats away at it too much more. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is getting closer to my desired outcome, I'm still hoping for a better split. There are still rounds left, and inflation is hitting my gains hard. I'll see if I can negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable. This offer gives you a good portion of the money while still providing me with a significant share. It's a compromise that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a balance here. My offer is still significantly better than what you'd get if we split it evenly now, and every round that passes hurts you more than it hurts me. Let's be smart about this. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

With inflation hitting my potential gains so hard, I can't afford to be too stubborn.  While I'd prefer a more even split, Alice's offer ensures I get a sizable amount before things get even worse.  It's time to take the deal and avoid further losses."
