"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, keeping most of the money, but giving you a fair share for your time. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a $1000 is a decent sum, the potential for greater gain in future rounds makes it worth rejecting. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a more equitable split, giving you a fair share while also ensuring I receive a substantial portion of the total sum.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this fairly. I'm willing to give you a larger share than before, but I also need to make sure I get a good portion considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation affecting Alice's gains makes this offer more favorable than her previous proposals. Accepting ensures I secure a decent amount, especially considering the risk of further rounds and potential for even lower gains."
