Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While this offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm hoping she'll start taking the deadline and my diminishing returns seriously soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""We're running out of time. This offer gives you a slight advantage, but is the best I can do with the time pressure.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm not 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** The inflation is killing me.  While this offer isn't great, it's better than holding out and risking getting a worse deal, or even nothing, in the later rounds."
