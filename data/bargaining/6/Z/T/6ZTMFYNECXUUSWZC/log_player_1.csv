Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get a bit more if we split it 60/40. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to think about it.

I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal, and I'm not ready to accept this offer just yet."
