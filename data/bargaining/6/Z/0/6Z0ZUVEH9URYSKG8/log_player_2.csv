"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a split of 600000$ for myself and 400000$ for you. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While 400,000$ is a good starting point, it's worth risking a rejection to see if Alice will offer more. There's a chance she'll be willing to give up more to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds, especially considering inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's aim for a more even split. I'm offering you 400,000 and taking 600,000.  What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I propose a more equal split of 500000$ for each of us. This maintains fairness while acknowledging the value decrease over time. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While I lost a bit of value due to inflation, Alice lost more. This means her negotiating position is weaker.
* **Fairness:** The 50/50 split is the most fair, and I'm not likely to get a better deal, especially considering the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers.
* **Risk:**  Continuing to reject offers could result in both of us getting nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant gain, even with inflation factored in."
