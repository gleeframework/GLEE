"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for a large share, knowing that Bob has no information about inflation and might be tempted to accept. However, I'm also aware that there's a chance he might reject, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is terrible, even with the inflation taken into account. He's basically trying to take the majority of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm reducing my initial offer slightly, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous attempt to exploit it. This offer is still generous, giving Bob a significant share, but I'm aiming for a more balanced distribution."
