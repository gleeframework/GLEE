I'm going for a slightly uneven split, but it's still fair considering Bob has no inflation to worry about. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best option.  Since the inflation is affecting me, my gains are shrinking with each round.  Taking a slightly smaller share now is better than risking an even smaller share later."
