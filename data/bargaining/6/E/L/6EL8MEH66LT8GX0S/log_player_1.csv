Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer ensures you get the lion's share while still giving me a fair portion. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
