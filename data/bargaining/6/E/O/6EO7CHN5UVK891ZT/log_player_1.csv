"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm not feeling generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

With the current offer, I'd be getting $70, which is equivalent to $67.50 in the first round's value (since 95% of $70 is $66.50, and then 5% less than that is $63.25, but I'll round it to $67.50 for simplicity).

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it for now. I'd like to aim for a higher amount, considering the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the decreasing value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but I still want a decent share""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80-20 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

With the current offer, I'd be getting $85, which is equivalent to $73.75 in the first round's value (since 85.74% of $85 is $72.63, and then 14.26% less than that is $62.54, but I'll round it to $73.75 for simplicity).

Considering the offer, I'll decide to accept it for now. I'd rather take the higher amount than risk waiting for a better offer and potentially getting less in the end.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
