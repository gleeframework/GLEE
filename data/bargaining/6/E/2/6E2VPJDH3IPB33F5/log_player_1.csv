"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd rather not split it 50/50 and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value now, I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the current value of the money, which is equivalent to 56% of the original $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than the original, my gain is now worth 51.2% of the original amount. Bob's offer is still a 50/50 split, which is not as good as my previous offer, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
