"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
``` 

I propose to take 95$ and leave 5$ for Bob.  This is a pretty fair starting point, but I want to see how he responds. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not afraid to take most of the money if he's not reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of me.  I'll reject this offer and see what he comes up with next.  While the inflation is a factor, I'm not going to give in to his demands just because he has the upper hand this round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still demanding a majority share. I'm hoping that Bob sees that rejecting my offer will only lead to more losses for him due to inflation."
