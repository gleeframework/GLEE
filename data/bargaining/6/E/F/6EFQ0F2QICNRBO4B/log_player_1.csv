"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Consider this one! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

In the first round, $8,000 was worth 100% of the original value, and in the second round, it's worth 95% of the original value (since 100% - 5% = 95%). So, in the second round, $6,000 is worth 95% of the original value, which is equivalent to $6,000 / 0.95 = $6,315.79 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is slightly better than my original offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. I'll propose a slightly higher amount for myself to make up for the lost value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still hoping for a better deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think this is my best offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round's value. Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll divide Bob's offer by 0.8567 (100% - 14.26% = 85.74% = 0.8574).

$5,500 / 0.8574 â‰ˆ $6,414.91 in the first round's value

I think this is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll accept this offer to get a decent share of the money.
