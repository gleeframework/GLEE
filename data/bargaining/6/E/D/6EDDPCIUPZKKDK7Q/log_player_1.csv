"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40% or $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30% I'd get, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
