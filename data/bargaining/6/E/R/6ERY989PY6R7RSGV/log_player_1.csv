"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50% share Bob is proposing, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With the inflation, my proposed 50/50 split would be equivalent to me getting around $475,000, which is not as attractive as Bob's offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial 50/50 offer, but still gives me a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the 14.26% decrease in value, my initial 50/50 split would be equivalent to me getting around $430,000. Bob's offer of $300,000 is a significant drop from that.

I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'm willing to consider it. After all, the money is worth less than it was initially, and I don't want to risk going to a worse split.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
