"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll receive in this round. 

In this case, I'll get 40/0.9 = 44.44, and Bob will get 60/0.9 = 66.67.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as the previous one. 

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still trying to get a good deal for myself!"
