"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Considering the inflation, 60 for me is equivalent to 48 in the first round, and 40 for Bob is equivalent to 38.4 in the first round. It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should settle for it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40% less for me due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my counteroffer:

  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I'm getting a bit shortchanged here. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now. Considering the money is worth significantly less for me, I'm not sure if I can afford to be too picky. Meeting in the middle might be the best option at this point. Here's my decision:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
