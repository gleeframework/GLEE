"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40%.""
}
```

This is a classic game theory scenario similar to the Ultimatum Game. I'm starting with a slightly advantageous offer for Alice (60/40) to see how Bob reacts to it. There's room to negotiate, but I need to keep the inflation factor in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation and the inflation working against me.  While his offer isn't terrible, I'm willing to gamble that he'll be more reasonable in the next round rather than risk the money losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing, making each round more critical for me (Alice). I need to secure a reasonable amount quickly.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob's previous offer indicates he's aiming for a larger share. By slightly increasing his proposed share from Round 2, I'm hoping he sees this as a compromise. 
* **Finality:**  The ""final offer"" statement adds pressure. It signals to Bob that I'm serious and won't be swayed further, encouraging him to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is a tough decision, but I have to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. Waiting any longer will only make things worse.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is clearly playing hardball. His message indicates he believes I will fold under the pressure of inflation.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for me. It's unlikely he'll suddenly offer something better in a future round. 

While 42 is less than I hoped for, it's better to take this deal than risk getting even less later."
