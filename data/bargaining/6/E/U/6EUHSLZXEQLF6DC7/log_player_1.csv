"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous share, but I'm taking the larger share to start strong and set the tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

Alice's gain: 45 / 0.8 = 56.25 (since it's 20% less than the original 60)
Bob's gain: 55 / 0.95 = 57.89 (since it's 5% less than the original 58.37)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll accept the offer to move on to the next round.
