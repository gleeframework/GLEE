"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting a fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair if I get a bigger part considering the time value of money.  Let's not waste more time with further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it. The game will proceed to the next round, where I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less in each round, I'll have to take that into account when making my next offer. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground before the money loses more value""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer $5,500 for myself and $4,500 for Bob, suggesting that we find a middle ground to avoid further losses due to inflation. Hopefully, Bob will find this offer more acceptable."
