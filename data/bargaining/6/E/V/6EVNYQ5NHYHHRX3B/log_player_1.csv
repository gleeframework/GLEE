Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 5500/4500, acknowledging the impact of inflation on me.  This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
