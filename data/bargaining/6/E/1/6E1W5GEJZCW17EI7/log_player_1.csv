"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor will only affect me, not Bob.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's frustrating that Bob is taking advantage of the inflation, accepting this offer is the best strategy. I'll get 100,000, which is less than my initial proposal, but it's better than getting nothing in the later rounds with further devaluation."
