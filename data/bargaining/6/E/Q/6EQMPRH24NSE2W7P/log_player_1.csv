"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  It's unlikely Bob will accept, but it sets a baseline for the negotiation and shows I'm willing to be aggressive. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair deal, and since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, accepting this ensures I get a significant share of the money.  Further negotiation is risky, as inflation could further erode the value of Bob's offers in future rounds."
