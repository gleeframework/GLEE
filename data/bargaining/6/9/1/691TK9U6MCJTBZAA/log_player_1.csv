"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take most of the money. I figure Bob will be happy to get anything, since he doesn't know about the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, the inflation means my share is worth less. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get something, and it's a fair split."
