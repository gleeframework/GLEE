"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a division where I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, with me taking a bit more. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer deal. This considers the declining value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIn this round, Bob has proposed a division where I receive $45 and he receives $55. Considering the effects of inflation, where the money I gain is worth 5% less and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to evaluate if this offer is acceptable to me. Given the adjusted values and the message from Bob suggesting this is a fairer deal, I will decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer. Now, it's my turn again to propose a division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I need to make a new proposal for dividing the $100, taking into account the further decrease in value due to inflation. The money I gain is now worth 10% less than in the first round (5% decrease from round 1 to round 2, and another 5% decrease from round 2 to round 3), and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% decrease from round 1 to round 2, and another 10% decrease from round 2 to round 3).\n\nConsidering these adjustments, I will propose a division where I receive $57 and Bob receives $43. My message to Bob will emphasize the need for a compromise, given the decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""We're both losing value, let's compromise""}\n\n###\n\nI've made my proposal, now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's settle this. This is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob has proposed a division where I receive $48 and he receives $52. The effects of inflation have further reduced the value of the money for both of us, but more significantly for Bob. Given the adjusted values and Bob's message emphasizing the need to settle and suggesting this is a reasonable compromise, I need to consider if accepting this offer is in my best interest.\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of the money and the potential for further losses if we continue, I decide to accept Bob's offer. This way, we can both walk away with a share of the money, despite its reduced value.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI choose to accept Bob's offer, concluding the game."
