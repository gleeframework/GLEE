"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 700000$ gain for me and 300000$ for you. Let me know if this works for you.

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think this division is fairer. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time.  What do you think?"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose dividing the money with a 540000$ gain for me and 460000$ for you. This maintains a similar ratio to the previous offer but adjusts for the decrease in value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly higher share, accepting this offer is the best option. I've already lost a round, and continuing to play could result in a worse outcome due to inflation."
