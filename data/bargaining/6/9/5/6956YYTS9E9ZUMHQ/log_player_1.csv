Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this division is fairer. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
