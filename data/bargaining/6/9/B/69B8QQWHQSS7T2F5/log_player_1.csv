"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 2k and let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair. It's a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my $4,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's $6,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, but I'll give you a chance to negotiate further if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, but I'm leaving room for Bob to try to negotiate a better deal for himself."
