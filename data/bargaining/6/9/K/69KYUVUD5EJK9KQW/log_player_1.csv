"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the new amounts are:

My gain: 700000 * 0.95 = 665000
Bob's gain: 300000 * 0.8 = 240000

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I accept his offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
