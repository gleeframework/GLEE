"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I get a larger share, but it's still a decent offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal. Since I'm not getting a larger share, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
