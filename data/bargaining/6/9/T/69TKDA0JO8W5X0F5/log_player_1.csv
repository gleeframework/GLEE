"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose a 99/1 split in my favor. This gives me a significant portion of the money, while still giving Bob a small amount. As the rounds progress, the money will be worth less to Bob, so this offer is likely to be more appealing to him than a smaller share later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself.  The inflation is working in my favor, and with more rounds to go, I can likely secure a larger share of the money."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm going to stick with a strategy of offering a large share to myself, but slightly less than my previous offer. This is because with each passing round, the value of the money decreases for Bob, making him more likely to accept a smaller share."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this is a slight improvement over the last round, it's still far less than what I feel I can get. I'm confident that Bob will be more willing to accept a smaller share as the rounds progress and the value of the money continues to decrease for him."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my offer slightly each round, hoping to find a balance between securing a good share for myself and making the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept. As the rounds progress, the value of the money to Bob will decrease further, making this offer potentially more attractive."

```

I'm reducing my offer again, but this time by a smaller margin. I'm hoping to find a sweet spot where the offer is appealing enough for Bob to accept, while still securing a significant portion of the money for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but by a smaller margin than before.  With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to strike a balance between securing a good share for myself and making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.

```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to reduce my offer once more, but not by much. The inflation is heavily impacting Bob's perception of the value of the money, and with only two rounds left, it's likely he'll be more willing to accept a smaller share to avoid getting nothing at all."
