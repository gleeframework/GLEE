"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split in your favor. This is a fair starting point, given that I'll be facing a higher inflation rate than you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal. While it seems like a large amount, the inflation rate significantly impacts the value of my share. I will reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I propose a 7000/3000 split, still favoring you due to the inflation difference.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still allows for a substantial gain for both of us. It's a compromise that acknowledges the inflation pressure but keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my initial proposal, and the inflation has hit both our gains significantly. Even though I'm losing more money, the value of Bob's share is declining even faster. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

Given the escalating inflation and the fact that Bob is not willing to negotiate, I propose a 50/50 split.  This is the most equitable solution at this point, considering the rapid decline in the value of our shares.  While it's not ideal, it's a way to secure some value before the money becomes practically worthless."
