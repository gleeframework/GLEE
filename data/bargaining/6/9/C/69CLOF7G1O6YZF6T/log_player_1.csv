Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very greedy offer, knowing that Bob will reject it. This will give me the opportunity to propose again in the next round and be more strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the money.  Waiting another round might mean a better deal for me, but also the risk of Bob getting a larger share due to inflation."
