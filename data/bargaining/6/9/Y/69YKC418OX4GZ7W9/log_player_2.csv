"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This offer benefits both of us. Let's settle this now, as the money will be worth less with each passing round due to inflation.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 52/48 split.  This accounts for the inflation we both face, but ensures a fairer outcome.  Let's wrap this up.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to finalize this. Your offer was still heavily impacted by the rapid inflation for you. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split.  This is our best chance to secure a decent amount before the value deteriorates further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
