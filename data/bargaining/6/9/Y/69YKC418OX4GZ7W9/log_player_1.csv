"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 52/48 split.  This accounts for the inflation we both face, but ensures a fairer outcome.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
