"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Split it fairly, let's end this""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, and I'll take 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the $300,000 I'd gain is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $285,000.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll try to be more aggressive, considering the inflation effect. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the initial $1,000,000, and I'll take 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain! With the 14.26% reduction, the $450,000 I'd gain is now worth 85.74% of its original value, which is $385,130.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. It's a bit closer to my desired share, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive again, considering the inflation effect. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no more games""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the inflation has reduced my potential gain by a significant amount."
