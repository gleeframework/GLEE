Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even with the 5% inflation, accepting Bob's offer in round 2 is the better choice. Here's why:

* **Round 1:**  You offered to take $9000, but Bob rejected it.
* **Round 2:**  Bob is offering you $6000.  While this is less than your initial offer, it's still a significant amount.  
* **Inflation:** The 5% inflation means that if you reject this offer and make a counter-offer, you'll likely have to offer Bob a larger share to get him to accept. This could lead to a situation where you end up with less than $6000 after further rounds of inflation.

It's better to accept a slightly less favorable offer now than risk losing more money in subsequent rounds."
