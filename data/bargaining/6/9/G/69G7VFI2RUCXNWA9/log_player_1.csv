"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward and simple offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give you the majority 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since Bob is offering me $3,000, which is worth 10% less than the original $5,000 I proposed, I'm not getting a great deal. On the other hand, Bob is getting $7,000, which is worth 5% less than the original $7,500 he could have gotten if he had accepted my initial offer.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal""}

I'm proposing a slightly more asymmetrical split, where I get $4,000 and Bob gets $6,000. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob than my initial proposal, but still gives me a decent share of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not giving you the majority, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than before 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth even less than before, and Bob's offer is still not very generous. I'm getting $3,500, which is worth 27.1% less than the original $5,000 I proposed, and Bob is getting $6,500, which is worth 14.26% less than the original $7,500 he could have gotten if he had accepted my initial offer.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer again, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a slightly bigger concession to get a deal done""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, where I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can finally reach an agreement."
