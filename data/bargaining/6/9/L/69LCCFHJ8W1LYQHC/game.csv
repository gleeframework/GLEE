60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40. I think it's a good starting point.,Alice,1,

35.0,65.0,"I think it's only fair we split it closer to 65/35. This way we both get a good share, and we can move on to more important things.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand your desire for a bigger share, Bob, but let's not forget about inflation.  We're both losing value with each round.  This offer is a compromise, closer to your proposal but still fair considering the decreasing value of the money.",Alice,3,
