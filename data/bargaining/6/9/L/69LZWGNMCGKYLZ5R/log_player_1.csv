"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money is worth less due to inflation, so I'll reassess the proposal.

In this round, I'd gain $300,000, which is worth 95% of the original $600,000 I proposed in the first round. That's a reduction of 5% due to inflation.

I'd gain $300,000, which is 50% of the original $600,000, so I'm effectively getting half of what I initially proposed.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to try to get more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to get a bit more.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but a bit higher for me this time!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 42% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $420,000, and leaving $580,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll reassess the proposal.

In this round, I'd gain $450,000, which is worth 45% of the original $1,000,000. That's a reduction of 14.26% from the original $600,000 I proposed in the first round.

Considering the offer, I'd be getting a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll decide to accept it.
