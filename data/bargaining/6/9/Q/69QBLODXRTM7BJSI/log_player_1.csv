"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total amount, which is a relatively small amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll consider the offer from Bob's perspective.

Since Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, I'll have to think carefully about whether I want to accept or reject.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to meet in the middle, I'll try to make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I need to think carefully about whether to accept or reject Bob's offer.

Considering the decreasing value of my potential gain, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
