"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 7:3 ratio. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is fairer, given that I have to wait an entire round before getting anything. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my thinking to the changing value of the money.

Considering the new offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think a 6:4 split is fair, especially since I'm getting less value from the money due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll give you a slightly higher share. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
