I'm starting with a very generous offer, giving Bob a small amount.  This is to see if he's willing to accept something very unequal, and if he is, I can adjust my strategy for the next round.  It's a bit of a gamble, but I think it's worth it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being very greedy!  While the offer is better for me than the first round, it's still not a fair division. I'm going to reject and see if he's willing to negotiate further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  Since Bob was so greedy in the last round, I'm hoping he'll recognize that this is a fair offer and accept it.  If he doesn't,  I'll have to recalibrate my strategy for the next round."
