"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original amount, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I'll consider it. Since I'll be getting a smaller share of the original amount, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the next round, I'll try to get a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money. Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable this time, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for 40% of the original amount. I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money drops further."
