"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'm being generous!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, considering the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I was hoping to get a better deal!

Considering the inflation rates, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer, since the money is worth less due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
