4500.0,5500.0,Your split seems unfair given the inflation. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This ensures we both get a reasonable amount considering the money loses value over time.,Bob,2,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we're getting closer, but time is literally money here. I'm proposing 52/48 - a slight adjustment in my favor to account for the increasing inflation. Let's close this deal and both walk away with something worthwhile.",Bob,4,
