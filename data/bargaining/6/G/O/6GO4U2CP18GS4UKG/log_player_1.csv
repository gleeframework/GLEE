Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair and simple solution, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000
