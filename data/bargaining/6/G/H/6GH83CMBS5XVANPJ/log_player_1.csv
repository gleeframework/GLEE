"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1. I'll get a bigger share, but it's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm framing it as a fair start, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll need to get a larger share to make it worthwhile.

However, I also don't want to give Bob an easy win, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The stakes are rising! With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I need to make a stronger offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give away too much more. The middle ground is still not good enough for me. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about the proposal, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds if I can get a decent deal now.

However, I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to give me a better deal, and I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this one.

For now, I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve a bigger share. Let's see if you're willing to meet me halfway.""
}
```

I'm pushing for a more significant share, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a huge toll on the money's value! I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the massive decrease in value, I'm not thrilled about the proposal, but I'm also running out of time. I don't want to risk going into further rounds if I can get a decent deal now.

However, I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to give me a better deal, and I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this one.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The stakes are getting higher! With the money's value plummeting due to inflation, I need to make a very bold move.

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a huge risk, but I think I deserve a bigger share. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm going all-in on this one, hoping that Bob will accept it. If not, I'll be left with a much smaller share."
