Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to get 80% of the money now than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
