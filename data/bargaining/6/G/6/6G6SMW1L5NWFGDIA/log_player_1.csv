"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, considering the initial offer was quite low. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! This is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and keeping Bob happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much. You can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations. I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, but still keeping some room for negotiation. The money is worth significantly less now, so I need to get a good deal!"

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering the significantly reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about my next move. I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 6.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw. We're almost out of time, and this is a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more conciliatory, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. A 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise at this point."
