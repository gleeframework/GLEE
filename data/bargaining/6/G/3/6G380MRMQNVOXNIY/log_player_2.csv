"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. I'm not happy with a 40/60 split, especially since Alice will be losing more value with each round. I'm hoping I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500} 
``` 
I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  While this is still a significant share for Alice, it's a fairer split considering the inflation rates.  It's also a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take its toll, and I'm concerned I might end up with nothing if I keep rejecting offers.  This is a decent split considering the inflation rates, so I'll accept."
