Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to a deal. This offer is a slight improvement, acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

While Bob is acknowledging the time pressure, his offer is not improving quickly enough. The longer this goes on, the more he loses compared to me. I'll hold out for a better offer, but I need to be conscious that time is running out."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm holding firm on this.  It's a reasonable split considering the time pressure we both face. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting to feel the pressure and is holding firm, but his offer is still not favorable enough. I need to remain firm and show him I'm willing to risk it all to get a better deal. He's losing value faster than I am."
