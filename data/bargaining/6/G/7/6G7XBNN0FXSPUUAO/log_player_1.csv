"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a fair starting point, considering the game is just beginning and there's no reason for Bob to expect a better deal at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of rejecting your offer. This is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value by rejecting it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
