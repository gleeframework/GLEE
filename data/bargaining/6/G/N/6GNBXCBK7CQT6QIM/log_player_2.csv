While this seems like a fair split, it's in my best interest to reject and see if I can get a better deal. The inflation will hurt Alice more than it hurts me, so I might be able to leverage that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor. I think it's a fair compromise considering the inflation will affect you more than me.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still feeling the impact of inflation.  Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor this time.  We can work this out! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit too far in her favor, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. I'll reject and see if we can get closer to a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. A 55/45 split in my favor seems fair given the inflation we're both dealing with.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.""}
