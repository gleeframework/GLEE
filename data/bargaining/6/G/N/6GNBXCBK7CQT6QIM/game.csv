,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor. I think it's a fair compromise considering the inflation will affect you more than me.,Bob,2,

4500.0,5500.0,Let's meet in the middle. A 55/45 split in my favor seems fair given the inflation we're both dealing with.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.,Bob,4,
