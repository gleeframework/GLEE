"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, while still giving Bob something. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping it will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  With inflation, each round reduces my potential gains. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount, whereas rejecting it risks losing more in the future."
