Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The longer this goes on, the less your share is worth, Bob.  I'm being more than fair here - take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

""alice_gain"": 550000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a good deal for you considering the inflation.  Don't be stubborn and let's wrap this up! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal, it's better than continuing to lose more money due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets *something* and avoids a complete loss."
