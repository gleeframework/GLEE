"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, my friend!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being cautious, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll need to be more cautious as well. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20% gain for myself when the money is worth less in real terms. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not being too greedy, considering the inflation is affecting my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to be even more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30% gain for myself when the money is worth significantly less in real terms. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, I'm willing to split it down the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced approach, considering the significant inflation and the decreasing value of money. A 50-50 split might be the most reasonable option at this point."
