"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's be realistic! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get a bigger share of the pie. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept this offer. Let's see what I can come up with for Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but not all the way to 7k""}

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly bigger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I think 55/45 is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, especially since I'm losing even more value due to inflation. I think Bob is still trying to take advantage of the situation and get a bigger share. I'll have to think carefully about my next move..."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle again, but this time I'm not budging""}

I'm trying to get back to the original 50/50 split, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more since inflation is eating away at my gains. I hope Bob will see reason and accept this offer."
