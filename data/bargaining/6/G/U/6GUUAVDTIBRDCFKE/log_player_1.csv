"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal than that. Let's split it 70/30. ""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, inflation is making it increasingly difficult. It's better to accept a smaller gain now than risk losing even more in the next round."
