"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, and 5% less for Bob. Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000
Bob's gain: 600,000 * 0.95 = 570,000

I'll accept Bob's offer this time.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
