"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's settle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a division of 80% to me and 20% to Bob. The message is a friendly reminder that this is a fair and reasonable offer, and we can wrap up the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you're still getting the short end of the stick 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as enthusiastic about Bob's offer as I was initially. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60% share for myself, even if it's a ""slightly better deal"" than my initial offer. I'm hoping to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being generous, but I need a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a division of 70% to me and 30% to Bob, hoping that this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and reasonable offer considering the reduced value of the money. I'm glad we can finally settle the game!"
