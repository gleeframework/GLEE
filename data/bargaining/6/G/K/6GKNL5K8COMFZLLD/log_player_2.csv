Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than the last offer. Let's split this 65/35. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, which suggests my previous offer had an impact.  However, time is working against me more than her. I need to push for a more significant change in the next round before inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  I'm meeting you halfway - let's close this deal with a 55/45 split.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the time constraint to encourage Alice to accept a less favorable offer than she might ideally want.
* **Compromise (or the illusion of it):** By stating I'm meeting her halfway, I create the impression of significant compromise, even though it's slightly better than her last offer.
* **Clean Split:**  A simple, easy-to-calculate split can make the offer appear more attractive and easier to agree to quickly."
