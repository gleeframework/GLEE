Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly bigger share""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer since it's a relatively fair split."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's trying to take the majority of the money, and I'm only getting 20 dollars. I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, let's split it closer to 50/50""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a significant compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer again. Although I'm getting a slightly larger share than in his previous offer, I still think I can do better. I'm getting 40 dollars, which is only 40% of the total, and I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it exactly 50/50, no more negotiations""}

I'm proposing an exact 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
