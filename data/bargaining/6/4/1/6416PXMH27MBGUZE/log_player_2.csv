"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value due to the 20% inflation, I'll make a proposal that takes this into account.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2 
# Alice gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain in this round is worth 64% of the original value, and the money I gain is 2, which is 64% of the original value of 3.14 (since 2 is 63.5% of 3.14). 

I'll accept Alice's offer.
