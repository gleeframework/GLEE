"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact on you 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's better to see if Alice is willing to compromise further since the money is losing value for me each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to avoid further inflation. Let's split it this way."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your share, this is a fair adjustment 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
While I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, this offer is still better than waiting another round and potentially losing even more."
