"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the negotiations started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, reflecting my risk in continuing the game. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gains are worth 10% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split just yet. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 42/58 is a fairer split. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going all the way to 60/40.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not giving up too much."
