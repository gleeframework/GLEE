Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, as the inflation starts to impact both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I will explain my reasoning for rejecting in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation impacts you, but it also puts me at a disadvantage. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I rejected Bob's offer in round 2 because while it seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily disadvantages me in the long run. Accepting a 50/50 split now means I'll consistently lose value as the game progresses. My counter-offer in round 3 acknowledges the inflation impacting both of us while still aiming for a slightly advantageous position for myself."
