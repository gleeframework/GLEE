"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm offering you 90 dollars and Bob 10 dollars.  This seems like a fair starting point given the inflation rates.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than my initial offer, and the inflation will only make it worse for me in the future. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to 80 dollars for me and 20 for Bob.  I'm hoping this will be a more attractive offer for him, given the inflation rates.  We need to find a solution before the money becomes worthless!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposal, it's still not satisfactory considering the inflation rates. The loss in value for me is getting significant, so I'll reject this and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 75 for me and 25 for Bob. The inflation is starting to hurt significantly, so I need to find a solution soon.  I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally in line with my previous proposal, and the inflation is making it increasingly risky to reject any offer. It's time to accept and avoid losing even more value."
