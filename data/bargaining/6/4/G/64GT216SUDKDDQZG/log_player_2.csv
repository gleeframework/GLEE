Alice's offer:

This is a terrible deal for Bob!  Let's see if Alice will be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
Let's see if Alice takes this much more favorable deal for me!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's still not ideal, this is a better deal for Bob than the previous round, especially considering the inflation.  At this point, accepting is the more logical choice."
