"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, let's take it! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $500,000 I would gain in this round is only worth 80% of the $700,000 I could have gained in the first round, so it's a bit less appealing.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 80% of the money I could have gained in the first round, so I'll aim to get a bit more.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still not ready to settle. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $450,000 I would gain in this round is only worth 45.6% of the $700,000 I could have gained in the first round, so it's a decent offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
