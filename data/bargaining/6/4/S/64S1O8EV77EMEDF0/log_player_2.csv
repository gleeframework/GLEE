"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split fairly reflects the situation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems reasonable at first glance, I know that the money is going to be worth less with each passing round, and I want to make sure I get a better deal for myself.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can get a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split,  I'm aware of the dwindling value of the money and the limited rounds left. Accepting this offer secures me a decent amount, and further rounds hold a risk of getting nothing."
