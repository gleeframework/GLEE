"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, aiming for 90% of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much lower than my initial proposal, and I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  I'm not going to accept this right away. It's my turn to make an offer, and I'll try to push for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to lower my proposed gain to 6000, but still aim for a larger share. I'm hoping Bob will see that rejecting my previous offer hasn't gotten him a much better deal, and he might be more willing to accept a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I'm worried about the increasing effect of inflation. I need to try to secure a larger share before the money becomes even less valuable. I'm going to continue rejecting and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. Inflation is starting to hit hard, and I need to secure a decent amount before it gets worse.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that this is a fair offer and agree to it."
