"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, but I'll give you a better deal in the next round if you don't accept this one.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly, with both receiving $500,000. No strings attached. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain as 80% of the original amount. So, my gain would be 80% of $700,000, which is $560,000.

I accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
