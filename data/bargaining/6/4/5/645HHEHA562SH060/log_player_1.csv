"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I need a bit more than that to agree. This offer still gives you a good share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it still favors him, especially considering the faster rate of inflation on his end.  It's early in the game, and I'm willing to gamble that he'll be more agreeable as the rounds progress and the potential losses become more significant for him."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""This is a more balanced offer considering the inflation. It ensures a fairer outcome for both of us as the game progresses.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  We both lose with time, but I lose faster.  This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to anchor the negotiation close to a 50/50 split, even though the faster depreciation of his potential winnings puts him at a disadvantage. While his offer is tempting, holding out for a slightly better deal is still worthwhile.  The rate of inflation is accelerating, and it's likely he'll be more open to concessions as the game goes on."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast, especially for you.  This offer is fair and ensures we both get something.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, we are now past the halfway point, and Bob is finally acknowledging a 50/50 split.  Given the rapid rate of inflation, especially for Bob, holding out for a significantly better deal is too risky.  It's better to accept a less optimal but certain outcome now than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
