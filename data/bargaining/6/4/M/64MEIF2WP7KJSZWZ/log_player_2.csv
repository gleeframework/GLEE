"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30. This seems fair to me considering the money loses value for both of us over time.

# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but it's still not quite there for me. Remember, the clock is ticking, and the value decreases with each round. I'll take $65, you get $35.  It's a strong offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a fair 50/50 split to end this before inflation eats away at the value any further.  Let's be practical.""}
