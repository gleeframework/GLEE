"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose taking $90, and giving Bob $10.  It's a pretty lopsided deal, but I want to see how Bob reacts.  We have 12 rounds, so I'm willing to be a little aggressive early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being pretty generous, but I'm going to reject his offer. I'm hoping to get more than $80, and with the inflation rate, I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more even split this round.  Since Bob seems willing to negotiate, I think I can get a better deal than the 90/10 I offered in round 1."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is hitting Bob harder, and his offer is getting less attractive. I'll accept this offer, it's still a decent amount of money and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
