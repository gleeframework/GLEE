```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80, you can have the rest, no negotiations 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I don't think I'll accept this offer. I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need something better than 40. Can we meet in the middle?""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 90, you can have the scraps, it's my last offer 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It's getting tough!

I don't think I'll accept this offer. It's a very lopsided deal, and I'm not willing to give up 90% of the remaining value.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's getting desperate!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw. We're both getting close to nothing, so let's split it 50-50 and end this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to salvage what's left of the value."
