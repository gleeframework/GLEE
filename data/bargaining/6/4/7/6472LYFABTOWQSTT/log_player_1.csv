"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a balanced start""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a 50/50 split, which is a more balanced proposal. I'll take the $50 and hope that future offers will be more favorable.
