"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this.  A fair deal gets us both something. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting,  it's in Bob's best interest to reject and see if he can get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation will eat away at Alice's potential gains more than Bob's, making it more likely she'll offer a more favorable split later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a good share, but I need a larger portion to make this worth my while.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for both of us, but especially you.  I'm still open to a deal, but it needs to reflect the shrinking pot. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Bob would have liked to get more, the inflation is taking a heavy toll. Accepting this offer means he still gets a significant amount, and waiting longer risks losing even more due to the decreasing value of the money. It's a compromise, but a necessary one."
