"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, giving myself a large share.  I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept quickly to avoid the risk of inflation and potential losses in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me at least $50.  With each passing round, the value of the money decreases, making it increasingly risky to reject and try to negotiate a better deal."
