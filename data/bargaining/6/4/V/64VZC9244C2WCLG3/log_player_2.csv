"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40% of the money.  I'm sure we can find a better deal in the next round if you're not happy with this. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal. The 20% inflation rate is high, but I think I can get more than 40% of the money. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll take that into account when making my proposal.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 58% is a fair share for me. Let's close the deal!""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm looking forward to her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your need for a larger share due to inflation, but 58% is too high. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you 45%, which is still a good deal considering the inflation you're facing. If you accept, we can end this negotiation and both get our share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think 45% is a reasonable offer, considering the inflation. Meeting in the middle is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation in the next round. Let's close the deal and get our shares.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I accept her offer."
