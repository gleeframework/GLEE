"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10% and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While it seems tempting to take the money and run, waiting will give me significantly more leverage due to the rapid inflation for me.  Alice clearly undervalues how much the money will depreciate for me in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm losing value fast. This offer ensures we both benefit.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share. This offer still gives you a decent amount while being fairer to me. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to negotiate, but she's still undervaluing the pressure I'm under.  A 30/70 split might seem tempting given the depreciation, but I need to hold out for a better deal.  Each round that passes makes my position significantly worse, but she's still losing value too."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair split considering the time pressure. Let's close this deal and both come out ahead.""}
