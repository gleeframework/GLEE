"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly larger share since I'm starting""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but with a slight bias towards myself since I'm making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this time, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and take a smaller share this time, hoping you'll accept""}

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a more even split compared to my initial offer, and a smaller share for myself compared to Bob's offer. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced proposal."
