I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm taking more risk with the inflation rate.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a much worse deal for me than my original proposal. Even though my share is worth less due to inflation, I'm still taking a big loss. I'm not going to accept this offer.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While the inflation is hurting me, I'm willing to compromise a bit more to get a deal done.  I'm hoping Bob sees that this is a more reasonable offer than his last one."
