"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  I'm trying to get the majority of the money but still offering Bob a decent amount to make it tempting for him to accept. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than mine from the previous round, even after accounting for the inflation. I'm going to reject this and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for the majority of the money, but I've lowered my offer slightly to 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob.  I'm hoping that after rejecting my last offer, Bob will be more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than his previous offer, the inflation is hitting me hard. Even with the lower inflation on Bob's side, his offer is still not good enough. I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob.  The inflation is making things difficult, but I'm still hoping to secure a good amount of the money. I'm also hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise after rejecting my last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation has really taken a toll, and Bob is finally offering a 50/50 split. While it's not ideal, it's better than getting nothing. I'll accept this offer."
