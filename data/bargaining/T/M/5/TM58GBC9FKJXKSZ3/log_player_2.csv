"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. This seems fair considering the inflation working against us.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point for us. It accounts for the inflation we are facing, and gives us both a fair share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more than you. I'm willing to accept a slight decrease from my initial offer, but 55/45 is the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
