Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. I propose we split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time. I believe this is a fair and balanced approach, given the limited time and the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
