"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 
 
I propose a 50/50 split. This seems like the fairest and most logical way to start, as we have no information about each other's preferences or strategies."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more equal split, accepting this offer is the most rational decision. If I reject, I'll be the one proposing in the next round, and with inflation, my share will be worth even less.  It's better to take what I can get now."
