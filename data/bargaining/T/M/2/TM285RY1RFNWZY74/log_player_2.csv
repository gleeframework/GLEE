Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly.  Waiting any longer risks getting a much smaller amount later, even if Bob could secure a slightly better deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The difference between Bob's offer in Round 4 and Alice's offer in Round 5 is relatively small, especially considering the rate of inflation.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice is expressing a desire to end the negotiations. Holding out for a marginally better deal might push her to be less generous in future rounds.

Accepting the 450,000 USD now, despite the inflation, guarantees Bob a reasonable sum and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing.
