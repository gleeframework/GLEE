"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 700,000 for him and 300,000 for me, I'll try to counter with an offer that gives me a slightly better share. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

This way, I'm aiming to get a slightly larger share than Bob's previous offer to me, while still leaving him with a substantial amount."
