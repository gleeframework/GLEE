"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob will get $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm the one making the offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I should take the smaller share, even if it's 40%. I'd like to propose a new offer that might be more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less again, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $900,000 (after the first two rounds of inflation), which is $495,000, but due to the 10% inflation, it's effectively worth $450,000 to me, and Bob will get $450,000."
