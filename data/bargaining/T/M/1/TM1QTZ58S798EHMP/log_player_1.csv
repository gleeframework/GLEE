Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly, Alice. We're both losing money with each round. Time to be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

It's tempting to hold out for more, but with each round the value diminishes significantly. Accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice to ensure a reasonable payout for both of us."
