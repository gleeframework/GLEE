"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us a good chance to build on from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not getting any worse off, but I'm giving up a significant amount of money.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding out for a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, I'll take more this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive!

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm getting worse off with each round, and Bob's gain is decreasing in value due to inflation. I'm not thrilled about giving up even more.

However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, we're getting close!""}

I'm trying to find a compromise and meet Bob halfway. I'm willing to give up some of my gains to get a more balanced split."
