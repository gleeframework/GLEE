"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a bigger share.  Let's see what I can get by making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's switch the roles - I'll take a bit more this time, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less, but still more than half 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer to get more, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers as inflation bites into my share.  Plus, Alice is demonstrating flexibility, which is a good sign for future negotiations."
