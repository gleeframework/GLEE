"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 400k and keep 600k for myself. It's a good starting point.""
}

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less, so I need to be careful.
