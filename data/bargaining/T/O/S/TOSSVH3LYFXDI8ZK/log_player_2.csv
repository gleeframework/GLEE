Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation is working against us both. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This is a compromise, and it's better to take this deal than risk losing more to inflation in another round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
