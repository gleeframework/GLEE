"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a toll on me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think 2000$ is too low for me, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation from the previous round:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which I think is a more reasonable share considering the decreased value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a token amount 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a hit on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because 1000$ is still too low for me, considering the significant inflation that has occurred. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal, but I'm starting to get worried that Bob might try to take advantage of the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 48.8% inflation from the previous rounds:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2800,
  ""bob_gain"": 7200,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 28-72 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a tiny share 
# Alice gain: 400 
# Bob gain: 9600 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling my potential earnings now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because 400$ is almost nothing to me now, considering the massive inflation that has occurred. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal, but I'm starting to think that Bob is taking advantage of the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 67.23% inflation from the previous rounds:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1600,
  ""bob_gain"": 8400,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need some crumbs to survive.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 16-84 split, which is a very low share for me, but I'm hoping Bob will take pity on me and accept it."
