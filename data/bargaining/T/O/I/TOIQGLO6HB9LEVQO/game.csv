6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple split, Bob.  A 60/40 split seems fair to kick things off. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is a more equitable starting point, given the different inflation rates we face.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,"I understand the inflation puts us in different positions, Bob, but your offer is too skewed for me to accept. Let's find a middle ground.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this. How about a 55/45 split?  It acknowledges the inflation difference while still being a reasonable division.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, I'm still feeling the effects of inflation.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. While it might seem aggressive, it takes into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money for both of us.  Let's work towards a solution that minimizes our individual losses.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I'm willing to be reasonable, but a 70/30 split is simply too far.  The inflation is affecting both of us, and we need to find a compromise that reflects that. I'm open to a solution that gives you a slight advantage, but not at the cost of such a significant loss for me.",Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is hurting both of us, and the longer this drags on, the less we both get.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's just take it and end this.",Alice,5,
