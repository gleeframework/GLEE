Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is a more equitable starting point, given the different inflation rates we face.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still feeling the effects of inflation.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. While it might seem aggressive, it takes into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money for both of us.  Let's work towards a solution that minimizes our individual losses. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be reasonable, but a 70/30 split is simply too far.  The inflation is affecting both of us, and we need to find a compromise that reflects that. I'm open to a solution that gives you a slight advantage, but not at the cost of such a significant loss for me.""
