Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly even split, but favoring myself slightly. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust accordingly in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has decreased the value of my gains, this is a significantly better deal than the previous offer. Accepting this means we split the money evenly, which is a fair outcome."
