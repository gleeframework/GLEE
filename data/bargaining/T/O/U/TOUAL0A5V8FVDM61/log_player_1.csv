"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but don't expect me to be generous.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000, which is a relatively even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my $8,000 in the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, so in this round, I'd be getting $6,400 (80% of $8,000).

Bob's offer of $4,500 is 5% less than his original $4,750, so it's a decent compromise.

I'll think about it... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a better deal than that. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

This offer takes into account the continued inflation, with my gain being 20% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain being 5% less than in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are catching up with us!

In the first round, my $8,000 was worth 100% of its original value. Now, in this round, it's worth 48.8% of its original value, so I'd be getting $3,904 (48.8% of $8,000).

Bob's offer of $5,000 is 14.26% less than his original $5,800, so it's a decent compromise.

I'm not sure if I should take the tie, but it's a decent offer...
