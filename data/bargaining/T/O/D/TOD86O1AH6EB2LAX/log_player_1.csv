"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but I need a little more for myself.  How about 65/35? 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 65-35 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob's offer is still 20% less valuable to him due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to do better in the next round.
