"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money, or I'll make a better offer next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'll try to be more generous next round 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my offers now.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with the $2,000 I'd get, considering the inflation factor. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still a bit more than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get serious, meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more serious about the negotiation.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob in the middle and accept the $4,500. It's a fair deal considering the inflation factor."
