Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, but let's be reasonable. This offer leaves us both better off than another round. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The 5% inflation isn't too bad, and I'm willing to take the risk to try to get more money. Bring on the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Getting closer, let's meet in the middle-ish""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take $550,000 and leave Bob with $450,000.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance for a clean split. The clock is ticking, and we're both losing money. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. The inflation is starting to take a significant toll on the value of the money, and I don't want to risk losing even more. This offer is close enough to a 50/50 split that I'm willing to take it and end the game. Better to have a bird in the hand than to risk losing more money in future rounds!"
