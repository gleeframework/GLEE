"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll consider the actual values I'll get from this offer.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, but since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll actually get $32.

I'll reject this offer.
