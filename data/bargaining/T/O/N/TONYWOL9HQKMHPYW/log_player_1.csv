"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000 and take $6000. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's split it 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this round, the total amount is $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8), and I would gain $5,000. This is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
