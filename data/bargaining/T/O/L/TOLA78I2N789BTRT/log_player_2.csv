"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early in the game to accept a deal that gives Alice a significantly larger share. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but leaves room for negotiation.  Since I'm the one making the offer this round, I want to see if Alice will accept a deal closer to my desired outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering me a significantly lower share despite the inflation impacting me more heavily. I'm going to continue to hold out for a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 5500, hoping to find a middle ground and get Alice to accept.  The inflation is hitting me hard, so I need to start closing the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse with each round, even though inflation is hurting me more than her.  I need to hold out for a better deal or risk ending up with very little."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even split this time. With the inflation hitting me so hard, I need to find a compromise.  If Alice is willing to split it evenly, we both get something and avoid ending up with nothing."
