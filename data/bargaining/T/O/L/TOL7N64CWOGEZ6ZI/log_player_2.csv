"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000, you get $4,000. A fair deal considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems reasonable at first glance, the inflation factor heavily favors me in this scenario. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a more equitable distribution is possible.  Given the inflation affecting us both, I propose we split the money 7000/3000.  This allows us both to secure a fair share while considering the unique financial challenges we face.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation affects us differently, but your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a compromise: $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. This ensures a more balanced outcome considering the shrinking pot. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I still prefer my previous offer, Alice's counter-proposal is a significant improvement over her initial offer. Considering the inflation, accepting this deal is the most sensible option for me."
