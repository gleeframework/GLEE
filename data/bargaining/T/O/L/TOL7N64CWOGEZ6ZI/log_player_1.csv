Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a more equitable distribution is possible.  Given the inflation affecting us both, I propose we split the money 7000/3000.  This allows us both to secure a fair share while considering the unique financial challenges we face. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
