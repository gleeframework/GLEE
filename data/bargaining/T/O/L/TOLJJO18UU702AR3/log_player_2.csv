"Round 1

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, but remember the inflation. Let's be a bit more strategic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This way, we both still get a decent amount, and it accounts for the value decrease in future rounds.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I believe a 55/45 split is fairer given the decrease in value for my share. It still gives you a significant advantage, but it also accounts for the loss I'm experiencing with each round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, which is good. While her offer isn't terrible, I believe I can push for a better deal in the next round.  The longer the game goes, the more desperate she'll become, giving me leverage."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for you. I'm proposing 65/35.  It's a good deal considering the circumstances, and it allows us both to walk away with something.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise further.  A 45/55 split is still a better deal for you, but it acknowledges the significant drop in value I'm facing. Let's end this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is back to her Round 3 offer, likely a sign of desperation setting in. While I was aiming for 65/35, accepting 55/45 now is a safe move. It guarantees a decent gain and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we run out of rounds."
