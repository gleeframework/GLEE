Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair deal, considering the inflation. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is working against me more strongly than her, but I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would mean settling for significantly less than half the original amount."
