"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and keep the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90% share for myself and a 10% share for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is already worth less, and Bob's offer is more generous than before.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
