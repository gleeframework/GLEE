"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  We can adjust it later if we need to. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes next!  I'm not sure I'm happy with a 60/40 split, and I know we'll both lose money in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split.  It's a bit closer to my preference, and we can both still get a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can both do a little better. Let's try 52.5/47.5.  This offer accounts for the inflation, and I think it's still fair. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this offer is pretty close to my previous offer and accounts for inflation. It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more money by rejecting and going to another round."
