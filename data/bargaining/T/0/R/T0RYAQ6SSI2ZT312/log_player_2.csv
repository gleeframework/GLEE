Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need you to meet me halfway. This split makes the most sense considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting down to the wire, and Alice is unlikely to offer more favorable terms. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even with the inflation, rather than risking getting nothing at all if the negotiations fail."
