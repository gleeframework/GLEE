"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  I'm willing to compromise, let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amount I would gain from Bob's offer is 40 * 0.8 = 32.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I can do better than that, Bob. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and it's 40% less than in the first round, the actual amount I'm considering is now worth 60 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 38.4.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A 50/50 split seems reasonable, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
