"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
``` 

This is a classic game theory scenario. I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept quickly.  As the rounds progress, I can adjust my offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's tempting to take the $10, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'll propose my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm sticking with a similar strategy but slightly reducing my own take. I believe Bob may be more open to negotiation after my rejection of his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's a better deal than the last round, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'll propose my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my proposed amount, but not by much. Bob's inflation is accelerating, and I believe he'll be more willing to compromise soon.  I'm aiming to get as much as possible before the inflation effect becomes too strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still rejecting. While Bob's offer is becoming more tempting, I'm confident that I can get a better deal.  The inflation is hitting him hard, and I'm hoping he'll become more desperate in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my proposed amount again.  Bob's inflation is increasing, and I'm still hoping to get as much as possible before the time runs out.  I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not risking losing everything in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob's inflation is getting out of control, and it's likely that future rounds will be even worse for him. This offer ensures I get something, and at this point, it's a good outcome given the circumstances."
