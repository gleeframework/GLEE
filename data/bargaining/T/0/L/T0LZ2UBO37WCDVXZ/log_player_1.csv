Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both have to factor in the inflation. Let's start this off right, and we can move forward from here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
