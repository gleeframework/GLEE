Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but 90/10 is too harsh. How about a more even split that still benefits you significantly?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. 50/50 is the fairest way to split this. We both lose if we keep rejecting and the inflation continues. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
