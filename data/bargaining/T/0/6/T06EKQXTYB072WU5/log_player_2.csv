# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is working in my favor.  Alice is experiencing significant inflation, making each dollar less valuable to her with every round. I am willing to push my luck a bit further to try and secure a better deal."

# Alice's message: Trying to find a compromise before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, and her offers are creeping closer to a more even split. However, I'm still in a strong position. With each round, her potential gains diminish, making my offers comparatively more appealing. I'll hold out a little longer to see if I can secure an even better deal."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7200, ""alice_gain"": 2800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a very generous offer considering the circumstances. Don't let time run out!""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm keeping the majority of the gain. It's crucial to highlight the time pressure and the fact that Alice's position weakens with every passing round."
