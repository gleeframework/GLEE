"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take 60% since I'm taking a risk with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm not comfortable with such a lopsided split. Let's be a bit more even.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing. I'll take a small hit from my last offer, but this is the best you'll get. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, it's better to take what I can get before inflation eats away at the value further."
