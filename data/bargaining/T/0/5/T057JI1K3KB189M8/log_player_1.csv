"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation affects me more. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think a 60/40 split is fair? I don't think so. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need more for myself.""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I'll aim for an even more favorable split. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need a bigger cut to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle, I'll take 550k, you take 450k.  We both need to agree quickly before inflation eats away more of our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle! I'll consider his offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about meeting in the middle. I think I can do better than 450k. You're still getting a slightly larger share than I am, and I'm not convinced it's the best deal.""

I'll keep pushing for a better offer!"
