Let's see how generous Bob is! ðŸ˜œ  I'm offering him a small slice of the pie to hopefully get the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is an interesting twist with the inflation! I'm not happy with a 10% reduction in my share, and I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my share a bit more this round, hoping to find a compromise. Let's see if Bob is willing to budge!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  I've lost a lot of my initial share, but Bob's offer is still better than nothing, and it seems like I'm unlikely to get a better deal in future rounds."
