Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I'll take the 60% this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. While the split is the same as my initial proposal, just flipped in his favor, I'm not ready to give up yet. Since the money is worth less to both of us now, I want to try to negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer a slightly more even split, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message suggesting that we should try to find a mutually agreeable solution before the money becomes even less valuable. Let's see how Bob reacts!
