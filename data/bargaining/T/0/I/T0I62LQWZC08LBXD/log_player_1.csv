"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more for being the first proposer.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factored in, my gain of $5000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the previous round, so it's equivalent to $4500 in the original money.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer.
