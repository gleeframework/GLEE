"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, the impact of inflation is heavily skewed against me.  It's in my best interest to push for a larger share early on, as the value of the money decreases much faster for me with each round."
