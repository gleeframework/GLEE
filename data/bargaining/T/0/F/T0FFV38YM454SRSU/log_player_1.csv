"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very unequal offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and accept it!  I'll explain my reasoning in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer, and I'd rather get half the money than risk getting nothing at all."
