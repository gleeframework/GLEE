"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a fair starting point. I've also included a message to try to set a positive tone for the negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This offer accounts for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not ready to accept this offer yet. While Bob's offer does take into account the time value of money, I think I can still get a better deal. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to negotiate further to get a larger share. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI've increased Bob's share slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 4500 for me and 5500 for him, I'm trying to ""meet him in the middle"" by offering a compromise that's closer to his proposal, but still in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm still not convinced that this is the best deal I can get. Although the money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, I'm willing to take the risk and try to negotiate further. Bob's message tries to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not ready to give in yet. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Last chance for a good deal""}\n\nI'm still trying to get a better deal, but I'm also aware that time is running out. I've decreased my share slightly to make the offer more appealing to Bob, while also emphasizing that this is his last chance to get a relatively good deal. The next rounds will only make the money worth even less, so I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer - an even split. Take it or leave it, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think this is the best deal I can get at this point. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, an even split is actually a relatively good offer. I don't think I can negotiate a better deal, and if I reject this, the next rounds will only make the money worth even less. I'll take the safe route and accept the offer. {""decision"": ""accept""}"
