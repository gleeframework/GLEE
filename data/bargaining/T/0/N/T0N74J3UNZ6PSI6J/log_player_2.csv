Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I'll take a smaller cut 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. While she claims to be taking a smaller cut, the impact of inflation on her share is significant. By rejecting this offer, I increase the pressure on her and she'll likely be more desperate in the next round.  We're past the halfway point, and it's time to capitalize on her shrinking returns."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""I'm being more than fair, Alice. Don't let greed make you lose everything.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Point:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. Offering a slightly better deal than my previous ""final offer"" might be enough to sway her, especially with the added message about greed.
* **Slight Edge:**  I'm still maintaining a slight advantage in the split, which is crucial as the game progresses. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds left, every decision is critical. I need to find the balance between maximizing my gain and ensuring Alice doesn't walk away empty-handed, forcing me into the same situation."
