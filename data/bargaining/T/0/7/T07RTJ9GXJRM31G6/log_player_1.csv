"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, since I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still not giving away all the negotiating power.""
}
```

I've adjusted the split to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer, taking into account the further reduction in value of my share due to inflation.

After evaluating the offer, I'll reject it.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and Bob is trying to take advantage of that. I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of my share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, so I'll need to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to let you walk all over me.""
