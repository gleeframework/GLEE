"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, let's start with 80-20""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, as a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think 45-55 is a reasonable proposal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
