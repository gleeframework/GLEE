Let's see if Bob is generous enough to accept a 90/10 split in our favor!  ðŸ˜Š"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather take that than risk losing more money in the next round due to Bob's inflation advantage."
