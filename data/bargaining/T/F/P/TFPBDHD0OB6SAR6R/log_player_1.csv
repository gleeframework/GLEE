I'm going to offer Bob a small amount to start.  I hope he accepts, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, it's better to get 50% now than risk getting nothing later."
