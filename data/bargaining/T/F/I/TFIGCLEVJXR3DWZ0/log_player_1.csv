"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with $200,000. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a better deal.

I'll analyze the offer:

* If I accept, I'll get $250,000, which is worth $250,000 (since it's not affected by inflation).
* If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less in the next round, so Bob's offer would be equivalent to $675,000.

Considering the offer, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $750,000, and the money is worth 10% less now, his offer is equivalent to $675,000 in real value. I'll try to counter with a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, Bob! Let's find a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm still not satisfied with the split 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer:

* If I accept, I'll get $450,000, which is worth $450,000 (since it's not affected by inflation).
* If I reject, the money will be worth 10% less in the next round, so Bob's offer would be equivalent to $495,000, and then another 10% less in the next round, making it $445,500, and then another 10% less, making it $400,800, and so on.

Considering the offer, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
