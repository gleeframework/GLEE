"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable starting point and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of rejecting your first offer! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my effective gain would be 6,400 (8,000 * 0.8) and Bob's gain would be 2,100 (2,000 * 0.95).

Considering Bob's message, I'm not sure if he's being serious or just trying to negotiate. However, his offer is still quite even, and I don't want to risk losing more money in future rounds.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the next round.
