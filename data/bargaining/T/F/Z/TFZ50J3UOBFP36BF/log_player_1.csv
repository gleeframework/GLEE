"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time, but I think it's important to consider the value of the money in the future rounds. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'd rather aim for a higher share now. Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the value of the money will continue to decrease.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. I'll take $550,000, and you can have $450,000. It's a fair split, considering the value of money is decreasing.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share now and leaving some room for future rounds."
