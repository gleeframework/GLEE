"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the total amount is now 8,000$.

My offer for Round 2:
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, the total amount is now 6,400$.

Considering Alice's offer, I think I can do better than that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, the total amount is now 6,400$. But considering the previous round's offers, I'll try to make a better offer.

My offer for Round 4:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}"
