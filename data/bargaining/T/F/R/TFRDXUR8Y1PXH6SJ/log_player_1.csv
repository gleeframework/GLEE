"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm open to negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split that gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%. I'm being generous, but I'm also aware that the value of the money will decrease over time, so I'm trying to get a good chunk of it upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive now that the value of the money is decreasing.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the offer. I want a better deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'll try to get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of the money decreasing, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60% split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but still leaves me with a significant chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the majority of the money. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! I'll have to be careful with my next move.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced this is the best deal I can get. I'll try to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, and I think I can do better. I'll try to get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of the money continuing to decrease, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to split the money evenly, but I'm not going to give up any more than that.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
