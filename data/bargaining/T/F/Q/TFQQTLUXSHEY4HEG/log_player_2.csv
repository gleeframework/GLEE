Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer my previous offer, accepting a 50/50 split now makes sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Alice's share is worth less with each round, making her more likely to accept a deal closer to even.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing the game risks getting a worse outcome. There's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in future rounds.

A 50/50 split guarantees I get a substantial amount and ends the game swiftly.
