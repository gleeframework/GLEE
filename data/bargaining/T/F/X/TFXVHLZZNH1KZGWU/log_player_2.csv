Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure me, but I need to hold firm.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, but I still have a few rounds to try and get a better deal. Accepting now would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to the potential future offers."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you drive a hard bargain. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Even split? You should have thought of that earlier 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me! While this offer isn't ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject.  If I keep pushing and Alice doesn't budge, I risk ending up with nothing. It's better to take a smaller share now than risk losing it all."
