"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept and we can finish the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of the original value, so I'm looking at a gain of $7,200 (8000 * 0.9).

As for Bob's offer, he's proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer. I'll accept it to get a guaranteed gain.
