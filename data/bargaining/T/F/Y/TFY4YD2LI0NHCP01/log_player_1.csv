I'm starting with a very uneven proposal.  I'm aiming for a large chunk of the money knowing that there is a risk of inflation.  However, I think offering Bob a small amount might make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a much fairer offer, and while I'm losing a lot of potential gain, it's much better than risking losing everything due to inflation."
