# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early in the game to accept such a lopsided offer.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's getting late in the game. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not fair. While it's getting late in the game, it's not so late that I should accept such a lopsided deal.  I'll see what she offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle.  It's the fairest way to go, and we both get something before the inflation gets too bad."" 
}
