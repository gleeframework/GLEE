"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer of 50-50 split. It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with further inflation."
