6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but let's be realistic.  I'm willing to compromise, but a 65/35 split in my favor is more equitable considering the inflation we're facing.  This offers us both a good return before things get worse.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, we're running out of time! This back and forth isn't helping anyone. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering the inflation working against me. Let's close this deal and both walk away with something substantial.",Bob,4,
