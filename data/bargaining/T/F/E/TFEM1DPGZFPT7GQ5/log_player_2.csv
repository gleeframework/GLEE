Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but let's be realistic.  I'm willing to compromise, but a 65/35 split in my favor is more equitable considering the inflation we're facing.  This offers us both a good return before things get worse.

# Alice gain: 6500
