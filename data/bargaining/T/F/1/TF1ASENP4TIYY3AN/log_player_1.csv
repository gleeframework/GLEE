"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm proposing to keep the majority of the money, but I'm still offering Bob a decent chunk to make it worth his while to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my initial offer of $8,000 would be equivalent to $6,400 in this round.

Considering Bob's offer of $3,000 for me and $7,000 for him, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This offer is a bit more balanced, but I'm still trying to maximize my gain."
