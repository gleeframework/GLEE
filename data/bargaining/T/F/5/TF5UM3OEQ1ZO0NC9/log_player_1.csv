"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 30 dollars to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm willing to give Bob a decent chunk to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split the money more evenly. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
