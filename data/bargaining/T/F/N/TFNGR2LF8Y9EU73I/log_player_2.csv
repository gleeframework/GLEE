"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and reasonable, I've offered you a significant share considering the inflation impact is stronger on your end.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, I've adjusted my offer slightly in your favor, but I still believe I deserve a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is making small concessions, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the faster rate of inflation for me. Holding out a bit longer might push her to offer a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the inflation is hurting us both. This is a serious offer for a mutually beneficial agreement.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're both losing value, but I still think my share should be higher. Meeting you in the middle won't account for the difference in inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is acknowledging the inflation difference but still not offering a deal that reflects its impact. Accepting now would mean losing a significant portion of the initial value due to the rapid inflation on my end. I need to push for a better split in the remaining rounds."
