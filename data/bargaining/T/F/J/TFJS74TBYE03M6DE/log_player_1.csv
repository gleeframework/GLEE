"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good deal before the inflation hits!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, my share would be $160,000 (200,000 x 0.8). Bob's share would be $768,000 (800,000 x 0.96).

I'm not happy with this offer, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, my target share is now 640,000 (800,000 x 0.8). I'll offer Bob a slightly lower amount to account for the remaining value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to Bob!"
