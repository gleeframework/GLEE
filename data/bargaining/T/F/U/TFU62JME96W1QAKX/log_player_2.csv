Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest way, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split in Round 3 is better than risking a worse offer from Alice in subsequent rounds. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly, especially for Alice. This makes it more likely she'll be willing to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on. 
* **Potential for worse offers:** Rejecting this offer could lead to Alice proposing an even smaller amount for Bob in the future, as her potential losses from inflation are much higher.

Therefore, accepting the current offer guarantees Bob a reasonable share, even if it means Alice gets an equal amount."
