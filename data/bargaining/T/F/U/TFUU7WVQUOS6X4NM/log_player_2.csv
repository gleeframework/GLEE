Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we split the money 60/40. It's a generous offer considering the inflation. Let's not waste time haggling and end this quickly. What do you say?

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation is higher for you, I think 55/45 is a fair split. We should take the money before it's worth even less.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hitting me harder. I'm proposing 53/47.  It's a compromise, and it's better than letting the value decrease further for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
