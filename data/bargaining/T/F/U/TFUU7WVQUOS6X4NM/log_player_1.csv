Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the inflation is higher for you, I think 55/45 is a fair split. We should take the money before it's worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
