Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Start with a strong offer, let's finish quickly!""
}
```

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a big share of the money! I'm not interested in giving him the majority of the money. Here's my response:
