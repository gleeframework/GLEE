Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and avoid further rounds. This gives me a good starting point and allows us to finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep more money for myself, it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  Each round means the money is worth less to Bob, so he is less likely to accept an unequal offer in the future.  This ensures that I get at least half the money."
