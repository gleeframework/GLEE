"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end this game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting Bob to be a tough negotiator!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $250,000 is actually worth $200,000 in real value, and Bob's gain of $750,000 is worth $712,500 in real value.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer and end the game.
