Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said 52/48 was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. 57% for me, 43% for you. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the clock is ticking, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of the potential gain due to inflation. Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop this dance. A clean 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**  The longer this goes on, the more I lose due to inflation.  Offering a 50/50 split is fair and puts the pressure on Alice.  If she rejects this, she risks getting a worse deal in the later rounds where my desperation might lead me to accept a less favorable offer."
