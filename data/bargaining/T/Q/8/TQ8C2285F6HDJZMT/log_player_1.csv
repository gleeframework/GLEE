"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 into a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This offers a reasonable share while still leaving a significant amount for Bob.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fairer split than your previous offer, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're open to it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
