Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

This is a classic example of the Ultimatum Game with the added pressure of inflation. While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage makes the most sense:

* **Avoiding Further Losses:**  Inflation is eating away at the total amount. Accepting now guarantees a decent share, while further rounds risk significant devaluation. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has already rejected offers where he receives less than half. It's unlikely he'll accept anything less favorable to him in future rounds. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a positive outcome. Rejecting risks walking away with nothing if we can't agree in later rounds."
