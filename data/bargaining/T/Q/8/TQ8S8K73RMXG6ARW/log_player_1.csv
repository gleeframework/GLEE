"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I think 60-40 is fair, but in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\n\nConsidering the effects of inflation and Bob's offer, I will reject his proposal. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to try and maximize my gain in the next round. Also, accepting a 40-60 split now would mean I get less than I initially offered Bob, which doesn't seem like a good deal for me.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### AI: Round 2\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer. I want to make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better deal.\n\n### AI: Please proceed to Round 3. I'll make an offer then."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### AI: Round 3\n\nConsidering the effects of inflation, I will adjust my offer to try and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to try and find a middle ground that Bob might accept.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation, 55-45 seems fair""}\n\n### AI: I am offering $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for Bob, with the message ""Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation, 55-45 seems fair"".
