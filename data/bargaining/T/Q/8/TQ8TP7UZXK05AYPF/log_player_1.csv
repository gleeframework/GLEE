"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% and take the rest. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. Let's split it 60-40. It's a good compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'm not willing to give up that much. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, Bob, but I think I can do better than 40%. How about we meet in the middle at 55-45?""
}
```

Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, my offer will be a bit more aggressive. Here's my next move:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk I'm taking. 55.5-44.5, my last offer.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, Alice. Let's split it 50-50. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers, trying to squeeze me out. But I'm not giving up yet!

However, I think a 50-50 split is a reasonable offer, especially considering the inflation. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I think we've both been reasonable. 50-50 it is. Let's shake on it and walk away with our respective shares.""
}
