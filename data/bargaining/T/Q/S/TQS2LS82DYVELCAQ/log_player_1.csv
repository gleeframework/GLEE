Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor.  This seems fair, considering you took the lion's share in the last round. Let's get this done quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
