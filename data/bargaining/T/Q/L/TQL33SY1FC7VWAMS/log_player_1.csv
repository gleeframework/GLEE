"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's split it 60/40!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time.  I'll take 55 and you can keep 45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about giving up 5 more dollars than I initially proposed. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle! 50/50 split this time?""}

I'm proposing a more even split, hoping Bob will be more willing to accept this round!"
