Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept getting only $1!  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
```

I'll start with a more equitable split, but I'll need to secure a good share for myself!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is much fairer than her first offer, and I'm happy to accept an even split.  Let's end this game!"
