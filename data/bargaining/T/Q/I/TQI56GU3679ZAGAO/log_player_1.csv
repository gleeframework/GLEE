"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60. My message to Bob is that I'm proposing a fair split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I'll take the lead this round.  We can split the difference from your offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $60 in the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's worth $57.

As for Bob's offer, he's proposing a split of $40 for me and $60 for himself. This is an increase in his gain from the previous round, but still a bit more than my initial offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,

I'm offering Bob $45 and keeping $55 for myself, with a message that I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share."
