Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit to 57/43. This acknowledges the inflation affecting us both, but still fairly reflects the larger impact on my side. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57
