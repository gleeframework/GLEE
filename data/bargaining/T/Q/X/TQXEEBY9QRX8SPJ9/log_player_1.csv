I propose to take 990,000 and give Bob 10,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as it leaves a bit of a buffer for Bob to potentially negotiate more in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 900,000 and offering Bob 100,000. This still leaves a significant amount for me, but it shows I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement."
