I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, with me getting 90% of the money. It's a pretty generous offer considering the inflation. Hopefully, Bob sees it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the 50/50 split now. Even though I'm getting less than my initial proposal, the inflation is going to eat away at the value of the money with each passing round. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all!"
