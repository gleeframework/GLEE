"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is a pretty good deal for him, so I hope he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not being generous! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is being quite aggressive!

Considering the inflation, the value of the money has decreased, so I need to be more cautious. Since I'm getting $100,000, which is worth 95% of the initial $100,000, and Bob is getting $900,000, which is worth 90% of the initial $1,000,000, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and let's end this!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more reasonable and offer Bob a larger share, but still keep a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the new values, the $250,000 I'd get is worth 25% of the initial $1,000,000, and the $750,000 Bob gets is worth 75% of the initial $1,000,000. This is a tough decision, but I'm not getting any younger, and I need to think about my own gain.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's compromise and make it a fair split!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob a reasonable amount. Fingers crossed he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering the new values, the $400,000 I'd get is worth 40% of the initial $1,000,000, and the $600,000 Bob gets is worth 60% of the initial $1,000,000. I'm not getting a great deal here, but I'm starting to get worried that if I reject this offer, I might not get a better one in the next round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
