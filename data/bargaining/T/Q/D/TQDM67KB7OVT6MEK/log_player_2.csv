Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** My gain is worth 9.75% less than in Round 1, making the current offer of $4000 equivalent to roughly $3620 in Round 1 terms.
* **Better Than Previous:**  This offer is significantly better than my previous offer of $6000, which was rejected.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting again means I'll be the one making an offer in Round 4, but the inflation will further devalue my gains. Accepting guarantees me some money, albeit less than what I initially wanted."
