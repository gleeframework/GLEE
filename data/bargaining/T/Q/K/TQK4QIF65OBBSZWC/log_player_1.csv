"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I don't like the fact that Bob is getting more than I am, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
