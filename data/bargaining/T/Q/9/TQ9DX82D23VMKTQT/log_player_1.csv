"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but I'm also aware of the inflation, so I'm keeping a large portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, I'm not sure how the inflation is affecting Bob.  Accepting this offer is a safer bet than risking further rounds and potentially losing more money."
