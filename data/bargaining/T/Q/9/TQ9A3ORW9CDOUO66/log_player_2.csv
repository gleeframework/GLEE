"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While this seems like a fair deal initially, Alice is getting significantly more. Since the money devalues for Alice with each round, I have a good chance of getting a better offer later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us. This offer won't be on the table for long.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning the Tables:**  I'm mirroring Alice's offer to highlight the disparity. 
* **Time Pressure:**  By emphasizing that my offer is time-sensitive, I'm hoping Alice will seriously consider it before inflation eats into her potential gains. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm aiming high, I'm open to adjusting my offer in later rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is budging, but very slowly.  A 19% decrease in value for her is significant, yet she's only offering me an extra $200. I think with a little more pressure, I can get a much better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and the deal is getting worse for you every second. Let's be realistic and close this out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to a middle ground to show willingness to compromise, but still favoring myself slightly.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the time pressure again.  Alice has lost almost 20% of her potential earnings already.  
* **Directness:** By calling for a ""realistic"" approach, I'm hoping to nudge Alice away from overly optimistic counter-offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to find a middle ground, don't push me too far. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This offer is insulting. Alice is trying to take advantage of my desire to reach a deal, but she's actually moving *further* away from a fair split compared to her Round 3 offer. I need to stand firm and show her I'm serious."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you a very reasonable deal considering the circumstances. Take it before it's too late for both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm lowering my asking price slightly, but still keeping the majority. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not to be walked over.
* **Stronger Language:**  Alice needs a reality check. I'm dropping the pretense of friendliness and expressing my frustration directly.
* **Final Warning:** By emphasizing the ""too late for both of us"" angle, I'm hoping to spark some urgency and prevent her from holding out for an unreasonable amount longer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

It's painful, but I have to accept. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and Alice is clearly willing to drag this out.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** While her offer isn't great, waiting longer means even a ""winning"" outcome for me will involve a smaller pot overall.
* **Unpredictable Alice:** I can't be certain Alice will come back to the table with a better offer. She might be stubborn enough to hold out for a highly unfavorable deal, risking both of our gains. 

It's better to secure something now than risk losing everything in a few more rounds."
