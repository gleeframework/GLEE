"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is worth 10% less than the initial amount, I'll consider the effective value of the offer. In this case, Bob's offer is worth 90% of the initial $600,000, which is $540,000.

In comparison, my gain of $400,000 is still worth the same as in the initial round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll make a new proposal in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Let's see if you'll accept!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, giving Bob a larger share of $550,000, while I'll take $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze the offer. Since Bob's offer is worth 27.1% less than the initial amount, his offer is worth 72.9% of the initial $700,000, which is $504,300.

In comparison, my gain of $300,000 is still worth the same as in the initial round.

I'm getting a bit concerned about the direction of the negotiations. Bob seems to be taking a larger share, and I'm not sure if I can afford to give up more. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, giving Bob a larger share of $580,000, while I'll take $420,000. I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a better deal and protecting my own interests."
