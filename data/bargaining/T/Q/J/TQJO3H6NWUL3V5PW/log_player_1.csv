"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself, which is a 80-20 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'm going low! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $800,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd be getting $640,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $100,000, which is still a significant decrease from my original proposal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my $640,000 from the previous round is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd be getting $512,000 if I were to accept the previous offer. But since I rejected it, the money is now worth 64% of its original value due to two rounds of inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway, let's compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","With two rounds of inflation, my $800,000 is now worth 64% of its original value, and with the third round, it's now worth 48.8% of its original value, so I'd be getting $392,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $50,000, which is a significant decrease from my original proposal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
