I propose taking $9,000 and giving $1,000 to Bob. This is a fairly generous offer considering the inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm still willing to take a smaller share, but I need to make sure I get a decent amount considering the increasing inflation.  I'm offering $8,000 for myself and $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal, the inflation rate is making things worse with every round. It's better to secure at least $3,500 than risk getting nothing at all."
