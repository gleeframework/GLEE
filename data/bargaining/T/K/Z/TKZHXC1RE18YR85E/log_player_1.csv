"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more since I made the offer""}\n\nI made an offer where I would take 60 dollars and Bob would take 40 dollars. I also added a message suggesting that this division is somewhat fair considering I made the initial offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  Let's be reasonable. This offer is better for me than your last offer was for you, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer because, although he claims it's better for me considering inflation, I believe I can negotiate for a more favorable division in the next round, despite the decreasing value of the money. Let's proceed to the next round and see how it goes!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous. This is a good deal for both of us, given the circumstances.""}\n\nI made an offer where I would take 57 dollars and Bob would take 43 dollars. Given the impact of inflation on both of our gains, I believe this is a reasonable and somewhat generous offer that Bob should consider accepting. The message aims to convey that this division is fair and takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Let's see how Bob responds!"
