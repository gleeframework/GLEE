Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 55-45, with me taking 55. That way, we both get more than what you offered, and we can avoid the risk of inflation further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
