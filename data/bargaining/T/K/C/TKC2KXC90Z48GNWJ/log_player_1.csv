Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While a 55/45 split isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing.  The inflation is becoming too risky, and Bob's offer is still a significant gain for me.  It's time to cut my losses and accept."
