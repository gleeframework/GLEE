900000.0,100000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you 10% for now. We can adjust later if you think it's too much.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. I'm feeling generous, so how about a 60/40 split in my favor? Time is money, and it's ticking away for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"I appreciate your 'generosity', Bob.  But I think a 70/30 split is more realistic, given the circumstances.  Time is money, and we're losing it with each passing round. Let's be smart about this.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I see your game.  Let's stop wasting time and find a middle ground. I propose 55/45 split, it's a fair offer considering the time pressure.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, we're both losing money with every round.  Let's be sensible and split it 65/35 in my favor.  It's a fair compromise, and it'll save us both a lot of potential losses.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. We're both losing money due to inflation. I propose an even 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but we're running out of time.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, we're both losing money rapidly.  Let's settle this before we both get nothing.  I'll compromise with a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's time to be realistic and stop wasting time.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer.  A 55/45 split in your favor.  Agree to this, and we both walk away with something. Otherwise, we both lose, and that helps neither of us.",Bob,8,
