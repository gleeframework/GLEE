# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer is getting more reasonable, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll see if I can convince her to give me a bigger share in the next round."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  We are running out of time and I'm willing to take a slightly smaller cut to get this done.  It's better than both of us losing everything! 
# Bob gain: 530000 
# Alice gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, but given the high inflation rate and the fact that we are running out of time, I think it's best to accept this offer. Even though it's not the most ideal, it's still better than both of us getting nothing."
