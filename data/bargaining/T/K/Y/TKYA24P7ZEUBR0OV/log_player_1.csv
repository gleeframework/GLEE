"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10. I'll get the bigger share, but I'm willing to be generous.""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but I'm still offering Bob a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 90-10 split is fair, but with me getting the bigger share this time. It's your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting a much smaller share than I initially proposed. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is eating away at my potential gains, so I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a bigger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting worried about inflation, so I'm offering a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it.""
}
