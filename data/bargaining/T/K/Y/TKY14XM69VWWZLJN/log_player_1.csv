Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's start with a fair but slightly advantageous offer for myself.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something now, rather than risking losing more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation factor is a serious concern.  Accepting this offer gives me a decent amount of money, and guarantees I don't get nothing in the next round due to the inflation."
