"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60%, which is $60. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
