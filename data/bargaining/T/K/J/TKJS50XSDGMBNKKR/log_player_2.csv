{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. It's a more balanced start and gives us both a good chunk of the money before inflation kicks in too much.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and offer a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's still a decent deal, and we can avoid further inflation losses if we agree now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
