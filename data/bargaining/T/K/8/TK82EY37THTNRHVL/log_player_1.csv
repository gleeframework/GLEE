# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my turn now. This offer considers the time-value of money. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. The current offer doesn't meet my expectations, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a better deal.\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3. I'll make a new offer considering the decreasing value of money for both of us.\n\n### Round 3\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Round 4\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for me due to inflation, accepting the 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable decision at this point. Further rounds would only continue to devalue my potential gain, making this offer the best option under the current circumstances."
