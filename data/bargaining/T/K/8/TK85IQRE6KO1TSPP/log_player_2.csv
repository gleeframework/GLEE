**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the heat from the rapid inflation hitting her share. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, she's still trying to take a larger chunk.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and her offers should be getting more desperate. I believe I can squeeze out a better deal in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. It's clear we both need to agree quickly with these inflation rates. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this point. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and the inflation is escalating. It's hurting Alice significantly more, but it's also eating into my potential gains. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair.  While I might be able to squeeze a bit more,  the risk of getting nothing at the end is increasing.
* **Strong Stance:**  The ""take it or leave it"" language signals that I'm serious and unwilling to budge much further. This might be enough to push Alice to accept, given her disadvantageous position."
