"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that I'll be taking the risk of the next round's inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $320,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is also worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $480,000.

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is fair, especially since he's trying to dictate the terms after I made the first proposal. I'll reject this offer and make a new one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the risk of inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which I think is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
