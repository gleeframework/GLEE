Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but the game is far from over. While the shrinking pot due to inflation hurts, settling for a poor deal now will hurt more in the long run. There's still room to negotiate, and I need to show Alice I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fair share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's stop wasting time and split the money evenly.  It's the fairest option for both of us.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Alice is clearly aiming for a lopsided deal, hoping the inflation pressure will force me to accept a raw deal. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most reasonable option, especially given the time constraint.  This offer signals I'm serious about getting a fair share and willing to walk away if needed."
