"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't do better than this. Accept and we can finish the game. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering a 50:50 split, I'm not getting a bad deal, but I'm also not getting a great deal.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger toll on my potential earnings, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better offer than this. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice. This is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings now. With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm not getting as much as I was hoping for.

However, Bob's offer is a 45:55 split, which is a relatively fair offer considering the circumstances. I'm not getting a bad deal, but I'm also not getting a great deal.

I'll decide to accept this offer. I don't want to risk going to Round 5 and facing even more severe inflation.
