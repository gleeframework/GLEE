"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering I'm starting the negotiations. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept, implying that 60% for me is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer to split the money evenly might seem fair at first glance, considering the inflation that has already reduced the value of the money by 20%, accepting this offer would mean I'm getting less value than what I initially offered Bob in the first round. I believe I can negotiate for a better deal, so I'm choosing to reject this offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to 55-45.""}\n\nGiven that we're now in the third round and the value of the money has decreased by 20% twice, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect this. By offering Bob 45% and taking 55% for myself, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the impact of inflation on our negotiations. My message to Bob emphasizes the need to adjust our expectations due to the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the need for adjustment. How about a 52.5/47.5 split? 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation (48.8% less than the first round), and given that Bob's offer is relatively close to my previous proposal, I believe it's wise to accept this offer. The difference between our proposals is minimal, and further negotiations would only lead to more losses due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures that I still receive a substantial amount, and it's better to finalize the deal now rather than risking further devaluation."
