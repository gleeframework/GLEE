"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I propose a division where I receive 75$ and you receive 25$. This offers a balanced distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing the decreasing value of money for both of us. This offers a more equitable distribution while still accounting for the inflation we're facing. Let's work together to maximize our gains before the value of the money dwindles further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
