40.0,60.0,"I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing the decreasing value of money for both of us. This offers a more equitable distribution while still accounting for the inflation we're facing. Let's work together to maximize our gains before the value of the money dwindles further.",Bob,2,
