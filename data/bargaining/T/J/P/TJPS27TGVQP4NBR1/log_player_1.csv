"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation. However, I notice that Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a significant improvement from his initial rejection of my 60-40 proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
