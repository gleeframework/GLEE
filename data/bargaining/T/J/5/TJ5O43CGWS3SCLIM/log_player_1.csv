Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor. This gives Bob a small amount, but hopefully, it's enough to make him accept and avoid the risk of getting nothing in the next round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  Since the money is worth less with each round, and I'm unsure of how inflation is affecting Bob's calculations, it's safer to accept a smaller amount now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
