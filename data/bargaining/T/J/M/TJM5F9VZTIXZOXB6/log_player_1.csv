"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I'm aiming for a more favorable split this time.  Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  The clock is ticking for both of us.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a slight hit here, but let's end this before we both lose out more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
Even though the offer isn't ideal, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting a 45/55 split now is better than risking an even worse offer from Bob in later rounds, or being left with a severely devalued amount if I have to propose in round 5."
