"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
I'm offering to take 80% of the $100, leaving Bob with 20%. This seems like a fair starting point, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my thinking accordingly.

In Round 1, I was offered 80, but due to inflation, that's equivalent to 64 in Round 2 terms (80 * 0.8). Bob's offer of 50 is equivalent to 40 in Round 1 terms (50 * 0.8).

Considering this, Bob's offer is a significant improvement over my original offer. I'll accept this offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
