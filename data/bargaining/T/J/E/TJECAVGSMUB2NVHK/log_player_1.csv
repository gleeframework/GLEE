"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the majority, but you'll get a decent chunk to start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and I'm not leaving Bob with too little to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a moderate proposal. You can try to do better next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the values are now:

* Alice gain: $3,200
* Bob gain: $4,800

I'll accept this offer. It's a decent split, and I'd rather get something now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
