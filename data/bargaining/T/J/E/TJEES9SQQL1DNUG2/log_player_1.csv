"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start with a clean slate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'd rather have a slightly smaller share now than risk waiting for a better offer later on. Plus, 4000 dollars is still a decent amount!

I'll accept Bob's offer.
