"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's previous offer was 60, and I want to increase my chances of getting a better deal, I'll make a lower offer. Also, I'll keep in mind that the money is worth 20% less due to inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less now, and Alice's offer is still relatively close to the initial offer of 40/60, I'll consider it a decent option. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.
