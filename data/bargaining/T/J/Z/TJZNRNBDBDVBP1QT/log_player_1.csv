Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. We both lose if this drags on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting due to its simplicity and the increasing pressure of inflation, it's still not the best deal for Alice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** Even though the nominal value is 50/50, the real value Alice receives is significantly diminished due to inflation. 
* **Negotiating Position:**  Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. Alice still has some leverage to negotiate a better deal. 

Alice needs to act strategically in the next round, conveying the urgency while aiming for a slightly higher share to compensate for the inflation impact."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but inflation is a real concern. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** By stating ""final offer,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency, pushing Bob towards a decision. 
* **Compromise:** The offer is a slight concession from Alice's previous offer, making it more palatable to Bob.
* **Inflation Factor:** The split still favors Alice slightly to account for the inflation she's experiencing, aiming for a deal that's more beneficial in real terms. 

This offer walks a tightrope between firmness and flexibility. It aims to secure a deal before inflation erodes the value further while leaving Bob with a sense of having gotten a fair deal."
