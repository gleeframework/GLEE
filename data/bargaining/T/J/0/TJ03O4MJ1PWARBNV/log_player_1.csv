"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's split the money 55/45, with me getting the larger share this time. It's a good compromise, and we can move on from here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
