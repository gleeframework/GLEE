"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $10,000, which is a fair starting point, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the equivalent value of the money in the first round. In the first round, my gain of $6000 was equivalent to $4800 in the second round. 

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $5000, which is more than the equivalent value of my first-round gain. I accept this offer.
