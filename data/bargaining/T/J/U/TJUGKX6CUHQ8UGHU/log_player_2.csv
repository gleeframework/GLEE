**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing. Waiting longer significantly hurts both players.
* **Alice's Declining Gains:** Alice's potential gains are diminishing much faster than Bob's. She's incentivized to make a deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds carries a significant risk of getting nothing if Alice plays tough. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed, even if reduced, share now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
