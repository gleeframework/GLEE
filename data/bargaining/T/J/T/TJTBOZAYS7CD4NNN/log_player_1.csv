"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split, with me taking the larger share, is a fair compromise after you proposed the reverse. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to flip the script on me. But I'm not having it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer. I think he's trying to take advantage of me, and I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split in his favor. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's even more generous than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 55/45""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."
