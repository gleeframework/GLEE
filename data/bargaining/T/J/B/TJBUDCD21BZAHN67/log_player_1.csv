"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is my offer: I take $99 and you take $1.  

I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, hoping to end the game quickly. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, 50% is still a decent split, and there's no guarantee I'll get anything better in the future."
