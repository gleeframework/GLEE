"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, take it or leave it!  ðŸ˜‰ 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer.  Let's see what Alice's next proposal is."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. Take this or we both lose out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle and avoid any more risk of losing everything.  It's the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is fair, and with each round the risk of losing everything increases.  Let's take the 500,000 and be done with it."
