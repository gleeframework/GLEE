"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that delays will hurt me more than you due to the higher inflation I face. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is reasonable, it's too generous to her. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  This offer reflects the difference in our inflation rates, while still allowing for a fair split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation difference affects us both, but your previous offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is fair considering the inflation and the risk of further negotiations.  It's time to end this game and secure my share."
