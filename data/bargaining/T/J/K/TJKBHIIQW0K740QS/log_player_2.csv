"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we'll both lose money with each passing round due to inflation, but the impact on me is greater. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's a good starting point, but I think I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away a significant portion of the money just to avoid a few rounds of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think a more even split is fair given the potential for inflation. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. This offer is a step towards a more balanced approach while still acknowledging the faster rate of inflation affecting my share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still not happy with this offer. While it's closer to what I believe is fair, I'm still taking a bigger hit from inflation than Alice. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 425000,
  ""alice_gain"": 575000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  Let's meet in the middle. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split and acknowledges the inflation we're both facing.  We need to come to an agreement before we lose even more.""
