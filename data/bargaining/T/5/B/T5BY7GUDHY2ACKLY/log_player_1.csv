"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering to take 60% of the $100 and leaving 40% for Bob. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is a slight improvement from my previous offer, and I'm willing to accept it to move forward.
