"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to take a slight majority, but I'm open to discussion.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too one-sided for me.  Let's find a more balanced split. This offer considers the impact of inflation on both our ends.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with such a large disparity. I'm offering a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation effects. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is now better than my previous offer will be after another round of inflation. It's better to accept a slightly less favorable deal now than risk getting even less later."
