"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, $200,000 is now equivalent to $180,000 in the original value. That's a significant reduction.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less in the first round and 10% less in the second round), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the money in the first round:

My gain in round 4 is worth 72.9% of the original value (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%).
Bob's gain in round 4 is worth 85.74% of the original value (100% - 14.26% = 85.74%).

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually a relatively good one for me. I'll decide to accept this offer.
