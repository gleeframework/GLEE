Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob likes a generous 90/10 split in my favor!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more, taking 5000 is better than getting 9000 with 5% inflation.  Let's take the 50/50 split and call it a day."
