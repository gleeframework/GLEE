"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is a bit more skewed towards him. I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger toll on the value of the money, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share given the inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger toll on the value of the money, Bob's offer is becoming more skewed towards him. I'll have to be careful not to give away too much.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of by inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a significant toll on the value of the money, Bob's offer is becoming increasingly lopsided. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer or risk waiting for a better deal.

However, considering the diminishing returns due to inflation, I think I'll take this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing at the end of the 12 rounds.
