Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is feeling generous in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm not sure how the inflation affects Bob's offer, but getting 5000 is better than getting 9000 and then getting 10% less because of inflation. It's also better than risking getting nothing in the end."
