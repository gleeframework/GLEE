60.0,40.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Consider that the value of the money decreases faster for me in the following rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Hi Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be more practical. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  It accounts for the faster devaluation of your share.",Bob,2,
,,"Hi Bob, while I appreciate the gesture, your offer doesn't quite reflect the faster rate of devaluation for me. Let's try to find a more balanced split in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I understand your point. How about a 55/45 split, this time slightly in my favor? It's crucial to act soon as the value decreases with each round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. We are both losing money with every passing round. Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day. A fair deal is better than no deal at all.",Bob,4,
,,"Okay Bob, you've convinced me. A 50/50 split it is.  Better to agree now than risk losing more to inflation.",Alice,4,accept
