Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be more practical. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  It accounts for the faster devaluation of your share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""Hi Bob, while I appreciate the gesture, your offer doesn't quite reflect the faster rate of devaluation for me. Let's try to find a more balanced split in the next round.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. We are both losing money with every passing round. Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day. A fair deal is better than no deal at all. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Okay Bob, you've convinced me. A 50/50 split it is.  Better to agree now than risk losing more to inflation.""
