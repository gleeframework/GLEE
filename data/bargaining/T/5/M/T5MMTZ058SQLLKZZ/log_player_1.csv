"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! 90% for me, 10% for you. Don't wait too long, the money is worth less with each passing round!""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split, 500,000 for each of us. This ensures fairness and avoids the risk of inflation affecting our shares. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to play it safe with an equal split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for 50% just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for more. The money is worth less with each passing round, so I'd like to aim for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You rejected the 50/50 split, so I'm offering 70% for me and 30% for you. Take it or leave it, the money is getting scarcer!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
