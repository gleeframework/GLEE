Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier, and time is running out. While rejecting this offer is risky, accepting it means Bob is losing a significant chunk of the potential gains due to the inflation. It's time to show Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. We are running out of time and losing money with every round that passes.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time pressure is mounting. Bob needs to convey a sense of urgency while still aiming for a reasonable split. This offer is a slight concession from a 50/50 split, but it's designed to be firm and final, pushing Alice to accept before the effects of inflation become even more detrimental."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, this is a good deal 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical. With only 3 rounds remaining and inflation eating away at Bob's potential gains, Alice is clearly exploiting the situation. Rejecting this offer in hopes of a better deal is incredibly risky. It's likely Alice will continue to lowball Bob, banking on his desperation as the deadline approaches. 

Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets something, which is better than getting nothing if they fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
