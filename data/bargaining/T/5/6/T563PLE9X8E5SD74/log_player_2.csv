"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm not giving up that easily. Let's split the difference from your last offer, 52.5% to me, 47.5% to you.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives me a chance to get more than your previous proposal. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, and her offers are becoming more reasonable. However, she's still trying to get more than me.  I'm willing to be tough and hold out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, especially for you.  I'm willing to meet in the middle at a 55/45 split.  Take this offer while it's still on the table!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** By now, Alice is feeling the significant impact of inflation. Her offers are moving closer to a more even split.
* **Compromise (Slightly):** I'm edging closer to the middle ground to make the offer more tempting for Alice while still securing a larger share for myself.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the time pressure, encouraging Alice to accept before inflation further erodes her potential gains."
