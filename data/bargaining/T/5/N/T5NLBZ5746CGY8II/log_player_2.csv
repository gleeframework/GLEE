"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though it seems fair now, I know that with each round, the money loses value. I want to see if I can get a better deal later!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a slight risk here, but I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in the long run.  I'm offering you 4000, and keeping 6000 for myself.  Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want a decent share. How about this? 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept Alice's offer.  While I might have gotten a slightly better deal earlier in the game, the inflation is starting to hurt.  Taking 5500 now is a good deal, especially compared to the risk of getting even less in future rounds."
