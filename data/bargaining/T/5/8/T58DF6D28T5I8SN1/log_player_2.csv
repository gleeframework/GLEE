"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds initially fair, the inflation heavily favors Bob.  It makes more sense for Bob to wait for a larger share, as the money devalues much faster for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation risk, how about a counter-offer that accounts for it?""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the Lead:** Bob needs to steer the negotiation in his favor. 
* **Acknowledging Concerns:** The message acknowledges Alice's point about inflation, making Bob appear more agreeable.
* **Strategic Offer:** This offer is still heavily weighted in Bob's favor. However, it's less extreme than Alice's initial offer and might seem like a fair compromise to her as the value decreases rapidly for her in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on me, this is a fair adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offer is moving in the right direction for Bob. However, it's still early in the game. While the money is losing value, waiting a couple more rounds could push Alice to offer an even larger share to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose if we don't reach an agreement soon.  This offer accounts for the time pressure we both face.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the Pressure:**  Bob needs to make Alice aware that time is a significant factor in the negotiation. 
* **Shifting the Focus:** The message subtly shifts the blame for potential failure onto both parties, rather than solely on Bob's rejection of Alice's offers.
* **Aggressive but Justified:** The offer is a significant jump in Bob's favor. However, with the rapid devaluation, it might be tempting enough for Alice to accept, especially as it's her turn to make a counter-offer next if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to find a middle ground despite the growing inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer, but her offer is still not favorable enough considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for her. Bob can afford to hold out a bit longer, applying pressure while being mindful that he needs to secure a deal soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your attempts to find common ground. However, we need to finalize this soon. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** It's time for Bob to signal that he's nearing his limit. Using ""final offer"" creates urgency.
* **Slight Concession:** Bob slightly increases his share from his previous offer, making it seem like a difficult but necessary move on his part. 
* **Pressure Point:** This offer, while still heavily favoring Bob, might be palatable for Alice due to the significant time pressure and the fact that rejecting it could lead to an even less favorable counter-offer in the next round."
