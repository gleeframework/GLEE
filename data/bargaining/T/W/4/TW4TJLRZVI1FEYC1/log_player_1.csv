"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  I'm willing to give you a decent portion, but I also need to make sure I get a good return on my investment.  I think this is a good starting point, considering the decreasing value of the money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
