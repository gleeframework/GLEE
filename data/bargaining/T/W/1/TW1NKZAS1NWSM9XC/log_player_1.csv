Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly, but still leaves a decent portion for Bob.  I'm hoping to end the game quickly, but I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob wants to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more money, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures that I get at least something, and it's better than risking getting nothing in a later round."
