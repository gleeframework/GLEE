"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. My message to Bob is a friendly reminder that accepting this offer would end the game quickly, but I'm sure he'll want to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I'll have to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to meet you halfway, I'd like to make a counteroffer!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 40. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the previous round, I'll try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this fair offer and we can end the game."
