# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, the rate of inflation is working against me. It's better to hold out for a better deal, as accepting this offer would mean I'm losing a significant chunk of the initial value due to the repeated inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice!  This is a fair offer considering inflation is working against me.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed working against you. I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go much lower 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is acknowledging the impact of inflation but is still heavily favoring herself.  While the offer is slightly better, it's not enough to offset the substantial loss in value I'm facing with each passing round. I need to push for a more equitable split before inflation eats away too much of my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only a few rounds left, the pressure is on. I need to convey a sense of urgency to Alice.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm lowering my demand slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but not by much.
* **Finality:**  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping Alice understands I'm serious and won't accept anything less favorable. 

This strategy aims to balance a firm stance against the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think you'll take this deal 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, I'm running out of options. While this isn't ideal, accepting a 45/55 split is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. The impact of inflation is too significant to ignore at this point."
