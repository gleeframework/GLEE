"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering a relatively equal split, but with a slight bias towards myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a bit more fair, given that I'm the one proposing now. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me!

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 60/40 split, especially since the value of my gain is decreasing with each round. I'd like to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, considering the inflation. Can you offer something closer to 55/45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on the split, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable ratio. I'll give you $4,500 and keep $5,500.""
}
