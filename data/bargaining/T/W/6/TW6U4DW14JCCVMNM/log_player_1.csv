"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","For Round 2, I'll calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

My gain: 40% of $100 = $40, but due to 5% inflation, it's worth $38
Bob's gain: 60% of $100 = $60, but due to 20% inflation, it's worth $48

Since I'd be getting $38 and Bob would be getting $48, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the decreased value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45."
