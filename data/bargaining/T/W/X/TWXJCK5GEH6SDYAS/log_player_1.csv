"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Start with a small amount for Bob to get him interested""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a relatively small amount to get him engaged in the game, while I'll take the majority of the money to set a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's my turn again!

I don't think splitting it evenly is the best strategy for me, considering I can still negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""You can have a bit more, but I'm not giving up my majority yet""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share than before, but I'm still holding onto the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. How about we split it 40/60?  It's closer to your initial offer, but gives me a bit more to work with. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up 40% of the money just yet. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still the one with the upper hand""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still keeping a significant majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 45/55. I'm being more flexible, but I'm also not going to settle for much less than half. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up 55% of the money, but I'm starting to think that 45% might be a more reasonable compromise. However, I'd like to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to push the boundaries a bit more. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close to my minimum, but I'm not budging much more""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a smaller share than before, but I'm still holding onto the majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time. I'm willing to stick with my last offer of 40/60. Let's avoid getting nothing at all! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think I've been too aggressive and Bob is trying to get me to accept a compromise. I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up 60% of the money, but I don't want to risk getting nothing either. Let's see...
