"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, that's a pretty one-sided offer from Bob!

I reject his offer. I'm not going to accept a proposal that leaves me with only 0.01% of the total amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting closer to the 50-50 split, but still a bit biased towards him.

I'll accept his offer. It's a decent compromise, and I'd rather settle for this than risk going to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
