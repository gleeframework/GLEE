"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I get a slight advantage, but it's not too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  This offer is fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's gain is higher than mine, and considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55 for him and 45 for me, I'll try to counter with a higher amount for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I think you're being too generous with your previous offer. Let's meet in the middle this time.""
}
```

This way, we're back to the original ratio, but with a slight adjustment to favor me this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly.  There's no need to keep going back and forth.  We can both get the same amount and be done with this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a fair deal, but I'm not sure if I want to split it evenly. Since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, I might be able to negotiate for a slightly better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50 for both of us, I'll try to increase my share slightly, considering the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slight edge given the inflation.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than 50, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept the offer."

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to rush the deal, but I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives him a higher share. I'll think about it...

}
```

This way, I'm getting a higher share, but I'm not being too greedy, considering the time is running out."
