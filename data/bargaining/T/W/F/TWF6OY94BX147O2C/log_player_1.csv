"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going for a strong opening offer, aiming for a big share. It's risky, but if Bob accepts, we both get something.  If he rejects, we'll see how he reacts to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible deal for me. While Bob's offer is inflated, I'm getting almost nothing. I'll reject and see if he'll budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a significant share.  We're both losing money due to inflation, so I want to get as much as possible before it gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still getting a very small share, and inflation is hitting Bob harder than me. I'm hoping he'll realize he needs to compromise more to avoid losing a lot of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping a majority share. With each round, the value of money is decreasing, so I need to secure a good amount before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than before, it's still not a fair deal for me. Inflation is hurting both of us, and I believe I can still get a better share if I keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping a majority share. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation and the dwindling number of rounds.  This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly better, but still not enough for me. Inflation is hitting him hard, but I'm still hoping for a more even split.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're both losing money rapidly. I think the best chance for both of us is to split it evenly now. I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing."
