"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 80/20, a good compromise? 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts would be:

* Alice gain: 20% of $80 = $16
* Bob gain: 80% of $80 = $64

I'm not getting a great deal here, but I'll think about it... Ah, I'll take it! I'll accept Bob's offer.
