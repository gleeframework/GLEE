"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $600,000, you take $400,000.  It's a fair offer considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 600k for me and 400k for you is a fair deal, considering the inflation impacting our gains. Let's end this here.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this inflation is hurting both of us. I'll come down a little - $550,000 for me, and $450,000 for you.  Let's be practical and wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Alice's offer. Although it's not the ideal outcome, with inflation eating away at our gains, it's the best deal I can get."
