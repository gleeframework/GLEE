"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and simple solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a 60/40 split, especially since I'm already losing value due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to protect my own interests and get a decent chunk of the money."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially considering the significant loss of value due to inflation. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
