"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to get ripped off either. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, and 10% less for Bob.

I'll analyze the offer:

* My gain: 200,000, which is worth 95% of the original $1,000,000, or 0.95 * 200,000 = $190,000
* Bob's gain: 800,000, which is worth 80% of the original $1,000,000, or 0.8 * 800,000 = $640,000

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think this is a relatively fair offer. I'll accept it.
