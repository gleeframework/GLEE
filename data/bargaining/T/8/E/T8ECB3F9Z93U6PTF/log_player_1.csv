"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I think this is a fair split, and I'm willing to give Bob a decent chunk of the money to start. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I don't think this offer is as good as the one I made initially, and I'd like to try to do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

My new proposal is:

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob a fair chance to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up quickly! Given the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable now. I'll consider it, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll need to be more aggressive in my proposal.

My new offer is:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm trying to get a fair share, considering the reduced value of the money."
