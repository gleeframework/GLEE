"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money, but I'm still getting the larger share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer. It's too skewed towards Bob, and I don't want to leave with only 30% of the original amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's my turn again! With inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so I'll aim for a more balanced offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the current offer, I think I'll accept it. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards him, but it's not as bad as it was in Round 2, and the money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

I'll take the 38% of the original amount, which is better than risking even less in future rounds.
