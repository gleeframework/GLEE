"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a good starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 4:1, I'll give you 3:1, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 3:1 ratio, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway between 4:1 and 3:1, a 5:4 compromise""}

I'm proposing a 5:4 ratio, which is closer to my initial 4:1 proposal, but still a compromise to meet Bob's 3:1 offer."
