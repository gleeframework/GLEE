Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a smaller share, as I know his money will be worth less in the next round.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds.  Especially since Bob's offer is actually more generous than my initial one, considering the inflation!"
