"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't like my first offer, so I'll try again 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time and split it evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being patient 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the deal is getting worse, I'm better off holding out for a bit longer and hoping she becomes more agreeable.  It's a risk, but getting less than 50% is a bad deal given the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure and inflation. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I need to signal that I'm willing to accept a less favorable split due to the inflation pressure. Offering slightly less than 50% shows I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm not going to accept a terrible outcome.  The message adds a touch of urgency for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you hard, I'll take more 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This is getting dangerous, but Alice is being unreasonable.  It's highly likely she's trying to push me to the brink and then offer a tiny amount in the final rounds. I'm hoping she realizes that getting nothing is a real possibility and starts negotiating more fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. We're running out of time, and I'd rather get something than nothing at all.""}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time for a strong signal. By repeating Alice's initial offer (which was already generous to her), I'm clearly demonstrating I'm at my limit.  The ""final offer"" language emphasizes the urgency and the very real possibility of both of us losing. This hopefully scares Alice into accepting a deal that's still in her favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I'll take advantage 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly playing very aggressively, but I'm betting she's bluffing and doesn't want to lose everything either. This offer is insulting, and while the inflation is hurting badly, I need to hold my ground for one more round.  It's a high-stakes gamble, but I'm hoping the fear of getting nothing will push Alice towards a more reasonable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""This is it, Alice. Take this offer, or we both walk away with nothing. Don't be greedy.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  This is the final push. I'm matching Alice's offer from Round 5.  

* **Signaling finality:** The message is blunt and direct, leaving no room for misinterpretation.  This is the last chance for Alice to get anything. 
* **Appealing to reason (and fear):**  Accusing her of greed might shame her into accepting. The fear of getting nothing is a powerful motivator, and this message hammers that point home.
* **Accepting the bad deal:**  Unfortunately, with only two rounds remaining, I have to make a significant concession to avoid complete failure. This offer is far from ideal due to the inflation, but it's better than nothing."
