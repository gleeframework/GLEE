"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $200,000. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I think it's a good starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but you'll get a chance to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this round, the $100,000 I would gain is equivalent to $95,000 in the first round's value. Still, it's a relatively small share, and I'm not sure I want to settle for that.

I'll reject this offer for now. Maybe I can do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still keeping a significant portion of the money for myself. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this round, the $300,000 I would gain is equivalent to $260,000 in the first round's value. It's still a decent share, but I'm not sure I want to settle for that, considering the significant reduction in value.

However, I'm not eager to reject another offer, as it might lead to a worse deal in the next round. I'll think carefully about this one...

After some consideration, I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than going into the next round with even less value.
