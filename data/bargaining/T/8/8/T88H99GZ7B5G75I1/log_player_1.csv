"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn.  I think this is more in line with a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's think strategically. While Bob's offer seems better than mine on the surface, the inflation hurts him more than me. He's likely getting desperate. I'll hold out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Inflation Advantage:** Time is on my side. Bob's share is devaluing faster than mine.  
2. **Increasing Pressure:**  Bob is likely feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. He needs to make a deal soon.
3. **Finality:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I increase the pressure on Bob to accept.  It signals I'm willing to risk it all in the final round if he rejects. 
4. **Strategic Retreat:** I've slightly decreased my demand from the first round (6000 to 5800). This makes my offer seem more ""reasonable"" after rejecting his, while still securing a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the best I can do. The inflation is really hurting my potential gains. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

1. **Diminishing Returns:**  While Bob's offer is still slightly in his favor, the difference is marginal.  The inflation means waiting another round is too risky. It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer from him. 
2. **Final Round Pressure:** This is our last chance to make a deal. If I reject this, we both walk away with nothing. Bob knows this, and there's a chance he's bluffing about his desperation. 
3. **Securing a Decent Share:** Accepting this offer still guarantees me 4900$, which, while impacted by inflation, is a significant sum. It's better to secure a decent win now than risk everything for a slightly larger but uncertain gain."
