This is a tough one, and going against a 40/60 split feels risky. However, the inflation is hurting me significantly more than Alice.  I need to push for a better deal while it's still worthwhile."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances.  We both need to agree before the money loses its value! 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, but time is running out, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing.  Alice is unlikely to offer me a better deal at this stage, and rejecting this offer carries the significant risk of ending up with nothing."
