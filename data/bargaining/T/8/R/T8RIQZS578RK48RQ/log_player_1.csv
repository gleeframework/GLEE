Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose keeping 9000 dollars for myself, and giving Bob 1000 dollars. This leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds, but ensures I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I propose to take 6000 dollars and give Bob 4000 dollars.  This offer is closer to a 50/50 split and addresses Bob's desire for a larger share, while still ensuring I get a majority of the money.  With only 10 rounds left, I need to start securing a larger share of the pot, but I also need to make sure Bob doesn't reject my offer out of spite and leave us both with nothing."
