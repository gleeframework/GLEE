"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion to begin with.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original 100$ and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer this time, but I'm still being cautious. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40$ is actually worth 36$ (40 * 0.9), and Bob's gain of 60$ is worth 48$ (60 * 0.8).

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as I'm giving up a significant portion of the remaining money. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I think we can find a fair split now.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which should be more appealing to Bob."
