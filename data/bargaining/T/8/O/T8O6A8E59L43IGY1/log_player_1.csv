"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the total amount. Let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and gives Bob 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to give you 40%. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $6,000 from the first round is now worth $4,800 in this round (20% less). Bob's offer is $3,000 for me, which is 60% of the new total, and $7,000 for him.

I'm not thrilled about the smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept it.
