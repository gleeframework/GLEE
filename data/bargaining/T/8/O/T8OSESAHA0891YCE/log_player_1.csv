"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate further if you don't like it.""
}
```

This way, I'm suggesting that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which is a relatively even split. I'm also trying to set a positive tone by suggesting that we can always negotiate further if Bob doesn't like this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, since I'm the one making the offer this time.  Let's see if you'll accept it! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll reject this offer since I was hoping for a more even split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. I think we can both be happy with this.""
}
```

This time, I'm suggesting a 50/50 split, which is a more even division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game!"
