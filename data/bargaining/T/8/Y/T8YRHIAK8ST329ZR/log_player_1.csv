"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 6,000 and leaving 4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 60/40.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor this time, I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Since I'm worth 10% less than before, I'll have to think carefully about this one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob wants to take a bigger share, I'll try to balance it out a bit.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not 60/40. How about 45/55?""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving me 4,500 and leaving 5,500 for Bob."
