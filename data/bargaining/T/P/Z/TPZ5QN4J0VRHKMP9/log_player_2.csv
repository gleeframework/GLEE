"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that inflation affects me more. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Your starting point seems fair, Alice, but how about we meet a bit more in the middle? This offer still acknowledges the inflation difference.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Bob. I'm proposing a small adjustment. Time is running out, and the inflation is working against both of us. 
# Bob gain: 370000 
# Alice gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is correct that inflation is working against both of us, it's working against her more quickly.  She's making minor concessions, but I believe I can get a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 390000, ""alice_gain"": 610000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the urgency, but this needs to be fair for both of us. I'm proposing a slight increase on my share, reflecting the faster rate of inflation you're facing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a compromise soon. This offer is a middle ground between our previous proposals. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is right, we're running out of time and the effects of inflation are getting severe. This offer is better than my last offer after accounting for inflation, and holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds is too risky. It's better to take a decent deal now than risk getting nothing."
