"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but still give you a decent share""}

I'm proposing that I take 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob takes 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still be fair 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking. In this round, my gain of $200,000 is actually equivalent to $160,000 in the first round.

I'm still not happy about the huge disparity in the split, but I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite lopsided, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's find a more equal split, I'm willing to compromise""}

I'm proposing a split of 45% for me and 55% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but still prioritize my share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $300,000 is actually equivalent to $192,000 in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not thrilled about the split, but I'll think about it. In this round, Bob's gain of $700,000 is still quite significant.

I'll decide to...

I'm proposing a split of 40% for me and 60% for Bob."
