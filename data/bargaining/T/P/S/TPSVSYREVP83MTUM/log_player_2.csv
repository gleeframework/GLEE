"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to play this strategically.  I'm not going to accept a 40/60 split right away, especially with the knowledge that the money is worth less to Alice with each round. I'll see what other offers she has."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer starting point, considering the inflation we both need to deal with. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation affects you too, but my loss is larger. Let's meet closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, Alice is taking a bigger hit from inflation. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something before the money becomes worthless."
