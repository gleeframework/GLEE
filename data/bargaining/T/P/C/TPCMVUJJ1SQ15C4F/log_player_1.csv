"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money closer to 50/50, as the value is decreasing for both of us.  This way we both get a decent amount before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
