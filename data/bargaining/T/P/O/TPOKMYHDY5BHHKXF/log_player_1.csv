Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial proposal. While the inflation has reduced the value of the money, it's not by a large enough margin to justify accepting such a drastic change. I'll counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer a compromise, bringing my share down closer to Bob's offer but still keeping a significant portion for myself. Hopefully, this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, and the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money for him. I'm confident that I can do better, and I'll continue to negotiate for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to maintain a firm stance while still showing flexibility.  I'm offering a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still a significant portion of the money.  The inflation has hit Bob harder, so I'm hoping this will encourage him to take a more balanced approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is making it increasingly difficult for him to secure a good deal. I need to hold firm and aim for a more equitable split. I'm confident I can still get a better deal, and I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering a compromise, bringing my share down slightly.  The inflation has been hitting Bob harder, and I want to be fair while also ensuring I get a reasonable share.  Let's see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still much too low, and the inflation has severely diminished the value of the money for him. I need to hold my ground and push for a more equitable split. I'm confident we can still find a solution that benefits both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm going to propose an even split. The inflation has significantly impacted both of us, and I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.  Let's see if Bob agrees."
