"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'd like to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need for negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'm inclined to accept it. Meeting in the middle can be a good way to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation.

I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
