"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid losing money to inflation. This offer gives us both a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a larger share to make up for the loss. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. Since I'm losing 5% value each round, I need a bit more to compensate.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is more than fair considering the inflation. You lose another 5% if we don't agree now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll take the risk of losing more value to inflation, hoping I can get a better deal in the next round. Alice's offer still gives her more than half, and considering the inflation, it's not as favorable for me as I'd like. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering I've lost nearly 10% value already and will continue to lose more, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's end this before we both lose out.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure and your losses. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation (18.55% less than the initial value), Alice's offer seems more reasonable. Continuing to negotiate risks further devaluation of my share, potentially leading to a worse outcome. Accepting this offer secures a tangible amount now rather than risking a further decrease in value."
