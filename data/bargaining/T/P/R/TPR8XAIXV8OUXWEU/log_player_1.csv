Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation on both our potential gains, I believe this division is fair and reasonable. Accepting this offer ensures we both receive a significant amount without further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
