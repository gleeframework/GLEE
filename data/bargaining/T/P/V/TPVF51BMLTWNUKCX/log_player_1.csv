"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a decent share, and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of $500,000 is worth 20% less than the $700,000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $560,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 5% less than his original offer, it's equivalent to $475,000.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain of $500,000 is worth 20% less than the $500,000 I would have gotten in the second round, so it's equivalent to $400,000.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's gain is worth 5% less each round, but my gain is worth 20% less.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than that. Meet me in the middle again, but with a slight twist.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal for myself 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of $475,000 is worth 52.2% less than the $700,000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $340,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's gain of $525,000 is worth 14.26% less than his original offer, it's equivalent to $442,750.

I'll accept the offer, as it seems like a decent compromise.
