"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a fair split might be tempting, Bob is better off trying to get a better deal.  Since the money is worth less each round, it's in Bob's best interest to see what Alice might offer in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 70/30 split. Let's try a 80/20 split, and we can both walk away with more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a balance. This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a better split than the previous round, Bob should still reject. He's better off seeing what Alice offers in the next round. Even though the money is worth less, there's still potential for a better deal for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 65/35 this time. This will give us both a reasonable share, and we can avoid losing more to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best choice for Bob.  It's a better deal than Bob's previous offer, and continuing to reject could lead to a situation where both Bob and Alice get nothing. It's time to take what's on the table."
