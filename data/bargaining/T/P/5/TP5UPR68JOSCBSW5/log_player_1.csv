Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000

While it's not the best deal in a vacuum, accepting Bob's offer is the smartest move at this stage. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer this goes on, the less your potential gains are worth. Another round means another 5% loss for you and 20% for Bob.
* **Bob's Declining Returns:**  The rapid devaluation of the money is pushing Bob towards a more even split. It's unlikely he'll offer significantly more than 50/50 in the future.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better offer carries the risk of Bob becoming even more desperate and offering a terrible deal or even running the clock out entirely. 

A guaranteed 50% of a shrinking pie is better than risking getting nothing at all."
