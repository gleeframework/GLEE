I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair offer given the potential for inflation and the fact that I'm proposing first."

While Bob's offer is closer than before, the inflation is hitting me harder, and I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself.  I'm not willing to accept a deal that puts me at such a significant disadvantage."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal. While the inflation is hurting both of us, I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable outcome in the next round. I'm not willing to accept a deal where I get less than half of the money."
