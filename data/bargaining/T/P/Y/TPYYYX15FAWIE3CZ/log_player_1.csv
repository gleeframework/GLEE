"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very greedy offer. Since the money will be worth less in future rounds, I want to get as much as possible now. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept such a small amount!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more,  it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  The money will continue to lose value for Bob in the future rounds, and it's unlikely he'll offer me more."
