Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, Alice. It's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is using inflation as a negotiation tactic, but he's undervaluing the impact it has on his gains. While a 50/50 split seemed fair initially, the longer he waits, the less his share is worth. I'll hold out for a better offer that reflects the true value of the money over time."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is working against you. This offer is fair considering the circumstances.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is eating away my share, I need a bigger cut to compensate. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting desperate, but his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor considering the inflation. I need to hold firm and emphasize that time is running out for both of us."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the most logical solution at this point. We're running out of time, and any further delay only hurts you more.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to draw a hard line. Bob needs to understand the urgency of the situation. By offering a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating fairness while still prioritizing my own interests. He's unlikely to get a better deal at this stage, as further rounds will only erode the value of his potential share."
