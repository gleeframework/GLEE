"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob! I'll give you 10% and keep 90%. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potential future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than the original $1,000,000, which is $950,000. Bob's gain is worth 20% less, which is $80,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the difference in our gains due to inflation. However, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to get a larger share. I'll accept the offer to get at least half of the remaining value.
