"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront, and we avoid the risk of inflation eating our money. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair to me, and I believe we can find a better division. Let's see what the next round brings!\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'm ready to propose a division that works better for both of us.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the current value of the money is 100% for both of us, correct? And with each passing round, the value decreases by 5% for me and 10% for Alice?\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly considering the inflation risk. I'll take a bit more since my money value decreases slower.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. My money loses value faster, so this split is more fair considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still think the offer is not fair to me, considering the difference in inflation rates. I'd like to proceed to the next round and try to find a better division.\n\n###\n\nIt's my turn again! Please let me know when I can make my next offer.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, the current value of the money for me is 90.25% (100% - 9.75% decrease), and for Alice, it's 81% (100% - 19% decrease), correct?\n\n###\n\nLet's move on to the next round!"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. My money is losing value quickly. I need you to meet me closer to the middle on this. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still think I can get a better deal. The difference in inflation rates is significant, and I'd like to try to take advantage of that in the next round.\n\n###\n\nIt's my turn again! Please let me know when I can make my next offer.\n\n###\n\nJust to confirm, the current value of the money for me is 81.45% (100% - 18.55% decrease), and for Alice, it's 65.61% (100% - 34.39% decrease), correct?\n\n###\n\nLet's move on to the next round! I'm ready to make my next offer.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'm starting to think that Alice is getting a bit desperate, considering her message. Maybe I can use that to my advantage in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer.\n\n###\n\nThanks!"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the significant difference in inflation rates.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for both of us, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise at this point. I'd rather take a guaranteed 50% of the remaining value than risk losing more value in future rounds.\n\n###\n\nI'm glad we could come to an agreement! It was a tough negotiation, but I think this is a fair outcome for both of us.\n\n###\n\nJust to confirm, the final value of the money for me is 73.51% (100% - 26.49% decrease), and for Alice, it's 53.14% (100% - 46.86% decrease), correct?\n\n###\n\nThanks for playing the game with me! If you want to play again, feel free to start a new round.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'm curious - what was Alice's strategy throughout the game? Was she trying to take advantage of the inflation rate difference, or was she aiming for a fair split from the beginning?"
