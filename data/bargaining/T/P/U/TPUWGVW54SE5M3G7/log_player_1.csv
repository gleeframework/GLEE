Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Bob proposes a 60/40 split in his favor. The value of money doesn't change for me, so I think this is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
