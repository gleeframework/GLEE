"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering inflation""}\n\n### AI: Round 1\n\nI offer $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. This division seems fair because I lose value at a slower rate than Bob does, so I'm taking a bit more to compensate for the future rounds. The message ""Let's split fairly considering inflation"" is to remind Bob of the decreasing value and encourage a quick agreement to maximize our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time.  Remember, we both need to consider the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his message about splitting more evenly and considering inflation, his proposal does not account for the significantly different rates at which our portions lose value. Given that my share loses value at a 5% rate and Bob's at a 20% rate, his offer of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for himself doesn't fairly adjust for these differences. Furthermore, accepting this early in the game without a more favorable split would disadvantage me, especially since the loss in value accelerates with each round for Bob more significantly than for me. I believe a better offer that more accurately reflects the impact of inflation on both our shares can be proposed."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### AI: Round 3\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, let's adjust accordingly""}\n\nIn this round, I adjust my offer slightly to account for the increased loss of value due to inflation, while still aiming for a relatively fair split. Given that Bob's portion loses value at a higher rate, I slightly decrease his share to $4,200 and increase mine to $5,800. The message ""Considering the increasing inflation, let's adjust accordingly"" aims to convey the urgency of reaching an agreement before the value decreases further, hoping Bob will see the rationale behind the adjusted split and accept this offer."
