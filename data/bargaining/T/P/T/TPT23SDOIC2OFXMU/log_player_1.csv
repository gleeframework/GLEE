"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a generous 10%!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 90/10 split is much fairer, considering your offer was so lopsided.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was too generous in the first round, and now he's trying to turn the tables with a 90/10 split!

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm effectively getting $720,000, which is still a significant amount. Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

For now, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less for me now (20% less from the first round, and another 20% less from the second round), I'll have to be more careful with my proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a decent share. Let's compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a more reasonable compromise considering the value of the money has decreased for me. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can find a mutually beneficial solution."
