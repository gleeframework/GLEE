"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, the effective amount I'd be getting is 20 / 0.8 = 25. This is still a relatively small share, but I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob was willing to give me only 20% in the previous round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 30 is the minimum I can accept.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, I'll take what's mine! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings now! The money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I'd be getting is 10 / 0.5168 = 19.39. That's a very small share.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject it. On one hand, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. On the other hand, 19.39 is a very small amount, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal, but I'm getting worried that I might end up with a very small share of the original $100."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's getting late in the game, and inflation is really eating away at the value of the money. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, hoping to get a better deal.

Considering the current value of the money, I'll offer Bob a smaller share, but I'll try to get a bit more for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 12,
  ""bob_gain"": 88,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I need to get a fair share. This is my final offer.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer and end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to leave you with a penny, you're being too greedy! 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, Bob is really squeezing me now! With inflation taking a 67.23% bite out of the value, the effective amount I'd be getting is 1 / 0.3259 = 3.07. That's an incredibly small share.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm starting to think that I should just accept it, even though it's a tiny amount. If I reject it, I risk losing even more value in the next round, and I might end up with nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can finally end this game. It's been a tough negotiation, but I suppose I got what I deserved."
