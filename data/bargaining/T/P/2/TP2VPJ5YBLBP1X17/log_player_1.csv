"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money, or I'll make a better offer next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the total amount, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $900,000 in Round 1 is now worth $720,000 in Round 2.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept the proposal. It's indeed a fair deal, and I'll take $500,000 and Bob will take $500,000.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
