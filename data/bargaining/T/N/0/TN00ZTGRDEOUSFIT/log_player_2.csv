"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This ensures a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's proposal seems fair initially, it's important to consider the inflation rates. The money is worth significantly less to Alice than to Bob, so she's likely to accept a less favorable split in later rounds as the money loses value faster for her.  By rejecting, Bob increases his bargaining power and potentially secures a larger share."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 6:4 split in my favor. This is more favorable to me than your previous offer, and still allows you a significant share. Consider that the money will be worth less for you in future rounds.""}
