"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'm losing money to inflation with each passing round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, so I'm proposing a slightly better split. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is better than my initial offer to him, and it's tempting to accept to avoid further losses from inflation. However, he's still getting a better deal overall. I need to hold out for a bit longer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5700,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  This offer is a good balance to account for the time pressure and the inflation you're facing. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting dangerous. Bob's offer is now lower than what I offered him in round 3. He's clearly trying to pressure me as the inflation eats into my potential gains. However, accepting this offer would mean I lose a significant amount compared to my initial proposal.
