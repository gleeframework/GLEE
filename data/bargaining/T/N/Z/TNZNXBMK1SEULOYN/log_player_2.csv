Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're down to the wire.  It's time to be realistic.  Let's split the money evenly.  500,000 for each of us.  It's the only way we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's risky to push it any further. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures we both walk away with something, rather than risking getting nothing at all."
