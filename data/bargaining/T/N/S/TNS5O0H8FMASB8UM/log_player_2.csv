Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't let inflation eat away your share 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side, but I'm still willing to share 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, hoping inflation will erode my bargaining position. While the offer is getting worse, I still have some leverage. Accepting $3,000 now is very low. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away, forcing her to offer a more reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Accept this deal or I'm walking.""} 

**Reasoning:**  I'm significantly lowering my demand to show I'm serious about walking away if Alice doesn't start negotiating. This offer is still better than what she offered in Round 5, even after factoring in inflation. It's time for her to realize I'm not backing down easily."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. Be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting bolder, but I can't accept this paltry offer. Accepting now would mean I value my time at practically nothing. She needs to understand that I'm willing to lose everything to avoid getting swindled. The threat of walking away needs to be real for her to negotiate fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Last chance, Alice. Take it or leave it.""}

**Reasoning:**  I'm sticking to my guns. This is the same offer I made in Round 6, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go. By repeating the offer, I emphasize that I'm serious about walking away.  Alice has two rounds to accept this before the deal expires and we both lose.  It's a risky play, but I need to show her I'm not bluffing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It's time to face reality, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but with only three rounds left and inflation eating away at my share, I need to be realistic. Accepting $2,000 is much better than getting nothing at all if this goes to the final round. Alice clearly holds all the cards now, and I need to cut my losses."
