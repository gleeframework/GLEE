# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth accepting.

After some thought, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially with the money losing value due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
