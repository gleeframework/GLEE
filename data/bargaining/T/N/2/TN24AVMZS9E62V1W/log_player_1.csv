"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth less due to inflation.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since we're now dividing the money more equally, I'll accept this offer.
