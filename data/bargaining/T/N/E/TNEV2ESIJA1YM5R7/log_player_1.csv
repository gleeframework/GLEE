"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message encouraging him to accept this as a fair starting point. Let me know what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, reflecting the value lost due to inflation.  Let's make a deal and finish this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I've decreased my initial offer by $2 to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get a bit more than Bob. Let's see how Bob responds!"
