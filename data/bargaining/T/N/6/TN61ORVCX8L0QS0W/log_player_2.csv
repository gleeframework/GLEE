Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting anxious, let's settle! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the offer is getting closer to something acceptable, Alice is losing value faster than Bob.  It's still worth holding out for a better deal in the hopes that Alice gets desperate and gives Bob a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly. This is a good deal for both of us considering the inflation.""} 

**Reasoning:**

After several rounds of back and forth, it's time to offer a deal that appears fair to both sides. While Bob has the advantage with inflation, pushing too hard could make Alice act irrationally. A 50/50 split has the best chance of being accepted, especially with the time pressure and increasing inflation."
