"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly this time. We both have to be cautious with the inflation, and a 50/50 split seems like the fairest way to approach this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
