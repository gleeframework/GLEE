"Round 1

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I am the one proposing, and there is always the risk of losing it all if we don't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to 6000/4000. While I'm willing to share more, I still believe I should get the larger share as I'm the one making the offer and the risks associated with rejection are still very high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is worse than the 50/50 split he offered in round 2, despite inflation reducing his gains.  I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to 7000/3000.  We're getting closer to the end of the game, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing.  This is a fair offer given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is fairly close to the 60/40 split I offered earlier.  With the risk of getting nothing increasing with each round, I think it's best to take this deal."
