"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we'll be losing value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain would be worth even less in the next round, so I'd better accept Bob's offer before things get worse.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
