"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the lion's share""}

I'm proposing that I receive 800,000 and Bob receives 200,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but let's see if Bob will accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Bob's offer is still a bit lopsided, but it's a slightly better deal than the first round.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much more""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, but still keeping a bit of a buffer for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer again.

The money is worth even less now due to inflation, so I'll need to adjust my thinking. Bob's offer is still a bit lopsided, but it's getting closer to being more balanced.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
