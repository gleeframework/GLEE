"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, suggesting that we can agree on a fair division without any further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for making the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think 30% is a bit too low for my share, considering the initial offer was a 50-50 split. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45 is a fairer share for me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, trying to find a middle ground that's closer to the original 50-50 split, but still acknowledges Bob's desire for a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small share, but I'm not giving you most of it. You'll have to do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the increasing inflation to get an even bigger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because 20% is an extremely low share for me, and the fact that Bob is trying to take 80% of the remaining money is not acceptable. I'd like to propose another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something closer to 50% to make it worthwhile.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, trying to find a balance that gives Bob a larger share, but still keeps me in a relatively strong position."
