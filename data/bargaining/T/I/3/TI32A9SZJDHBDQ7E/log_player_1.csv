"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you $4000. What do you think?""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, but I'm giving you a slightly smaller share to see how you'll react."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you something 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, and 10% less for Bob.

I don't think I should accept this offer. I'm getting a much smaller share than before, and I don't think it's fair. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with such an unequal split. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I still want a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my initial one, but still reflects my desire to get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value.

I'm shocked by Bob's offer. Giving me only $1000 is an extremely low share, considering the initial amount was $10,000. I think I've been pushed too far.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""This is an insult. I'm not accepting such a low offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth even less than before.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the remaining amount equally. It's not ideal, but it's a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up too much more."
