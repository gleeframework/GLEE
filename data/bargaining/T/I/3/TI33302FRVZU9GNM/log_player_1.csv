"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario, and I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. I know it's a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping to secure a good deal early on. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game. I'm going to reject this offer. It's a bit too generous to Bob! While I know the money is losing value, I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a good chunk of the money, but I'm lowering my offer a bit to show some compromise.  Hopefully, Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is starting to look more reasonable as the value of the money decreases, I'm still going to reject it. He's still trying to get the lion's share. I believe I can get a better deal if I wait.  It's getting risky with the inflation, but I'm still confident."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again.  This is getting closer to a more even split, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the money declining and come to a compromise."
