"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Fair share, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob receives $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly. This way we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the offer. I was hoping for a better split, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Compromise on a slightly more equal split, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal."
