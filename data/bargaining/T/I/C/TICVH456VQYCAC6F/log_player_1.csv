"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's split it 4:1""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial 1,000,000$ and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and simple solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better split, especially considering I'm the one making the proposal in the next round. I think I can do better than a 50/50 split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""A slightly more generous offer, but still a good deal for me""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining 1,000,000$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm trying to be a bit more generous this time, but I'm still looking out for my own interests. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should both take a slight step back, and split it 6:4. This feels fairer to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better split, especially considering the money is worth less due to inflation. I think I can do better than a 6:4 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""A slightly more generous offer, considering the inflation, but I'm still looking out for my own interests""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining 1,000,000$ and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to be a bit more generous this time, taking into account the effects of inflation, but I'm still prioritizing my own gain. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
