"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both walk away with a good amount of money!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the $1,000,000, which is $750,000, and Bob gets $250,000. The message is a friendly reminder that we should both accept this offer and end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40. It's a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amount I would get from Bob's offer is 80% of $600,000, which is $480,000.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make my own offer for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be fair, but I need to get a better deal to make up for the inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but I need to adjust for the inflation. Let's try 32/68. 
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings!

Let's calculate the actual amount I would get from Bob's offer: 48.8% of $680,000 is approximately $331,440.

I'm not thrilled about the 32/68 split, but it's a better deal than the previous ones. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make my own offer for Round 5."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob! I'm willing to compromise and give you an equal share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the inflation has taken a significant toll on my potential earnings. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
