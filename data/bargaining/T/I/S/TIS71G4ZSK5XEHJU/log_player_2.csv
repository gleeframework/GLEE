"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this division is fair and will allow us to avoid the risks of inflation.

# Alice gain: 650000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but my offer is still the fairest considering the fast-approaching deadline and the impact of inflation on my share. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation far more than I am. While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to hold out for a more equitable split, knowing that each round makes the deal less appealing for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 620000,
""alice_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer.  The clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at your potential gains far faster than mine. Take this deal while it's still good.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. We both lose out if we continue to haggle. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, Alice is right.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for her. A 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking a complete loss if we fail to reach an agreement."
