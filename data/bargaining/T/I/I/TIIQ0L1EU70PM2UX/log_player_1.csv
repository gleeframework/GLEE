"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. With the 5% reduction in value, the offer is equivalent to:

* My gain: 250,000 * 0.95 = 237,500
* Bob's gain: 750,000 * 0.95 = 712,500

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'm not willing to accept this offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn to make a proposal. Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Bob. This way, we both get a fair share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, another rejection! The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation.

Let's calculate the value of Bob's offer in the original amount:

* My gain: 200,000 * 0.85 (95% of the original value) = 170,000
* Bob's gain: 800,000 * 0.85 (95% of the original value) = 680,000

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'm not willing to accept this offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the current value of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. We can both get a fair share before it's too late.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a reasonable and fair compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
