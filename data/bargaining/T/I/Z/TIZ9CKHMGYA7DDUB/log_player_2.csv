"Round 1

# Alice gain: 60

``` 

It's worth rejecting this offer for a few reasons:

* **Inflation:** While the offer seems fair at first glance, it heavily favors Alice considering the inflation rate. Her money will be worth less than mine in the next round.
* **Potential for better deal:** By rejecting, I have the opportunity to propose a more favorable division for myself in the next round. 

This strategy gives me control and leverage in the negotiation."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's adjust the shares to maintain fairness. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to my proposed split from the previous round, I'm still not happy with it. I need to consider the following:

* **Inflation:**  Although I'm losing less than Alice, the inflation is still a significant factor. This offer still gives her a larger share, which is not ideal. 
* **My potential gain:** If I reject, I get to propose a split in the next round, potentially getting a larger share for myself.

I'm willing to take the risk and hope for a more favorable outcome in the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, accounting for the significant inflation impact on both sides. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

It's tempting to accept, as the inflation is making the offer progressively worse, and we're getting close to the end. However, I'm still losing a significant amount of value compared to Alice. 

Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Inflation's Impact:** Alice is experiencing a much larger loss due to inflation. While her offer is closer to my desired split, it still favors her, and I believe a more equitable split is possible.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** By rejecting, I can propose a better split in the next round. While there's a risk of not reaching an agreement, the potential reward of a more favorable deal outweighs the risk. 

I'm hoping to leverage the increasing inflation disadvantage on Alice's side to negotiate a better outcome for myself."
