"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\nI'll start by proposing a division that slightly favors me, considering the inflation impact is less severe on Bob. This strategy aims to negotiate a better starting point while being mindful of the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share considering the inflation impact.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the inflation rates. Let's move forward with this offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\nGiven the impact of inflation and the fact that Bob's offer still doesn't compensate for the higher depreciation of value on my end, I'll reject this offer. The goal is to negotiate a split that accounts for the uneven inflation rates affecting our gains.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round, where I'll make a counteroffer considering the adjusted values due to inflation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 3\nConsidering the adjusted values due to inflation and the fact that Bob's previous offer did not adequately address the uneven impact of inflation, I'll propose a division that factors in the depreciating value more accurately. This proposal aims to find a middle ground that acknowledges the different inflation rates affecting our shares.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the shares to maintain fairness.""}\n\nThis offer takes into account the decreasing value of money and seeks a compromise, while also ensuring that the division reflects the different impacts of inflation on both players."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing value with each passing round. I think a 60/40 split is a reasonable compromise that takes inflation into account. Let's get this settled. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 4\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and the fact that Bob's offer of a 60/40 split does not adequately compensate for this disparity, I'll reject this offer. The depreciating value of money with each round means that accepting this offer would result in a significantly lower real value for me compared to the initial rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will proceed to the next round, aiming to negotiate a split that more fairly accounts for the uneven effects of inflation on our respective gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 5\nGiven the substantial decrease in value due to inflation, it's crucial to adjust the proposal to reflect the urgency and the disproportionate impact on my share. Considering Bob's last offer and the need to find a mutually acceptable solution before the value drops further, I'll propose a division that slightly adjusts from my previous stance, aiming to meet Bob halfway while still acknowledging the uneven inflation effects.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, accounting for the significant inflation impact on both sides.""}\n\nThis offer aims to balance the need for a fair division with the reality of the depreciating value of money, encouraging Bob to accept before further losses occur."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're nearing the end, and inflation is hurting both of us. I'm proposing a 65/35 split to acknowledge the significant value loss you've experienced. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 6\nConsidering the drastic reduction in value due to inflation, with my potential gain now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, and acknowledging Bob's attempt to recognize the significant value loss I've experienced, I must weigh the options carefully. Given that this is Bob's final offer and the risk of proceeding to further rounds where the value could drop to nearly nothing, I've decided to accept this offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nWhile the 65/35 split is not ideal, the compounding effect of inflation makes the potential for any future gains increasingly negligible. Accepting this offer ensures that I receive some value, albeit significantly reduced, rather than risking the possibility of ending up with nothing if negotiations fail to reach an agreement before the deadline."
