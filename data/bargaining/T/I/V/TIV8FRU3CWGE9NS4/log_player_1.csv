"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'm getting a slightly better deal this time around. But still, Bob is getting a larger share, which might not be the best for me.

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $500 from the previous round, and reducing Bob's share by $500. This way, I'm trying to find a balance that works for both of us. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less, I'm getting a better deal this time around compared to Bob.

However, I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, considering the inflation. I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll accept this offer for now, as it seems like a decent compromise.
