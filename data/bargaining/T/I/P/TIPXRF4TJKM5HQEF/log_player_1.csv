"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly one, trying to entice Bob to accept the offer."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with the split, and I'm hoping to do better in the next round. The offer is still too skewed towards Bob, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer. Let's meet in the middle!""

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, aiming for a 70% share for myself and 30% for Bob."

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'm not happy with the split, and I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal, but I'll need to be careful not to give up too much."

{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really crippling me now!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Last chance, let's split it down the middle. I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm essentially giving up on trying to negotiate a better deal and opting for a 50/50 split. I'm hoping Bob will see reason and accept this offer."
