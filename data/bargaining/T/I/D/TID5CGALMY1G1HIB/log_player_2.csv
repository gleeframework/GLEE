"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept being given just $1! I'll take my chances with inflation and see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm giving you a decent share, but I'll need more to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest option at this point. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hurting me.  A 50/50 split is fair, and I'll take it."
