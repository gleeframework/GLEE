I propose a 99/1 split in my favor. This is a bold move, but I want to see how Bob reacts to a significantly unequal offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  This is a fair and reasonable offer. Since Bob rejected a 99/1 split in his favor, I believe he's likely to accept a more equitable division."
