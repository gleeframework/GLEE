"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I'm not going to give away the majority. You can try to do better. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the initial $1,000,000. 

In this case, I'd be getting $100,000, which is 10% of the initial amount. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more attractive offer to Bob. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the initial amount. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a good middle ground.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. You're not getting the better deal here. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts gained by each of us in this round. 

Since the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, his gain of $750,000 is actually worth 85.74% of the initial $200,000, which is $171,480. 

As for me, my gain of $250,000 is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's better than the previous one. I'll accept it.
