350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 65/35 split.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by letting the clock run and the fact that your share is losing value faster.",Bob,2,

800000.0,200000.0,"I understand you're playing it tough, Bob, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's split it 80/20. This gives you a decent share and avoids further risk for both of us.",Alice,3,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm increasing my offer to 70/30, but that's my final offer. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking and your share is shrinking.",Bob,4,

700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, I'm being more flexible with each round, and I'm now offering 70/30, which is the same as your last offer. Let's avoid the risk of further inflation and agree to this.",Alice,5,
