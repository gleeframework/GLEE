"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40. This way, I get the majority of the money, but it's still a relatively fair offer, considering I'm the first to make the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to give up 60% of the money, even though it's worth 5% less than the original $100. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 10% less than the original $100 now.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Bob 45% of the adjusted $90, which is $40.50. This way, I'm still getting a slight majority, but it's a more balanced offer compared to the previous rounds."
