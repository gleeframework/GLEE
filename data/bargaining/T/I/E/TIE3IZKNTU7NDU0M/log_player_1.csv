I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, taking almost everything for myself. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept such an uneven split right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is just being greedy. I'm not going to accept a proposal where I get only $1. I'll keep playing and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a 50/50 split. Bob rejected my first offer, so hopefully, he'll be more reasonable this time. It's a fair split, and it's better than getting only $1."
