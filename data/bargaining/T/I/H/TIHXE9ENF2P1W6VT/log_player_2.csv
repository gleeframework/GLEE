**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. This makes it less likely she'll offer a better deal in later rounds. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of reaching no agreement and getting $0 significantly outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal. 

It's time for Bob to prioritize securing a reasonable amount, even if it means accepting an equal split."
