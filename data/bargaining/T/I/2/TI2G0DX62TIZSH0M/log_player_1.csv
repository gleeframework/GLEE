"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You proposed 50/50, I'm willing to give you a bit less, but still a good deal for you 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
