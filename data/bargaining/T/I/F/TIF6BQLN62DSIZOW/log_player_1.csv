Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit unbalanced. How about I take 70% and you take 30% before inflation eats away at the value? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
