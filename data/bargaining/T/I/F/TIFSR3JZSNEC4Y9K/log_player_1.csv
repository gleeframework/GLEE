"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Since the money loses value over rounds, I'm trying to end the game quickly while still being somewhat generous to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 4500 in the second round is actually worth less than what I initially offered to take (6000 * 0.8 = 4800). I believe I can propose a better split in the next round, despite the decreasing value of money, to maximize my gain.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's be rational""}\n\nIn this round, I've taken into account the inflation and proposed a split that reflects the decreased value of money for both of us. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the initial round, I've adjusted my proposal to maximize my gain while still making it appealing to Bob, given the circumstances. The message is a reminder to Bob that we should both be rational about the decreasing value of money and try to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n###"
