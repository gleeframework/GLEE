"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of Bob to encourage fairness and cooperation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer seems fair on the surface, it's crucial to remember the inflation factor.  Even though I get a larger share now, the money will be worth less in future rounds if I reject.  It's better to see if I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 9000,
""alice_gain"": 1000,
""message"": ""I propose a 9:1 split in my favor. This reflects the value lost due to inflation. While I want to be fair, I need to prioritize securing a large portion of the money before it loses further value.""
}
