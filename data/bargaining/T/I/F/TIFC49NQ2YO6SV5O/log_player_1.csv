"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 9:1 split in my favor. This reflects the value lost due to inflation. While I want to be fair, I need to prioritize securing a large portion of the money before it loses further value. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
