Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get a little more if we split closer to even. How about I take 55% and you take 45%? This way we both get more than the last offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
