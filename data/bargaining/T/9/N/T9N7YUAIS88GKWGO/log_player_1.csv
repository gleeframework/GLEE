"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, it's only fair!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take most of the money, but I'll give you a little bit to keep things friendly.  
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially considering the inflation will make my share worth even less in the next round. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's only fair!""
}
```

I'm trying to be reasonable and split the money evenly, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
