"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm proposing to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000.  I think this is a fair starting point, as it offers Bob a chance to get something while still giving me the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. While it's better than Bob's initial offer, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering Bob $2000, which is a $1000 increase from his last offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise, as I am willing to give up some of my initial gain to reach a more equitable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal to get an equal split, I'm concerned that if I reject this, the next rounds will likely lead to a worse outcome for me. It's better to secure a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing at all."
