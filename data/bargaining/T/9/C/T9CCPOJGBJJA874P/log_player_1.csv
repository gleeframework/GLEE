"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm willing to give Bob a decent share. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share is now worth even less.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the offer is a 50-50 split, I'll have to consider whether it's better to take this deal or risk waiting for a potentially better offer.

After some thought, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, my share is worth even less. Bob's offer is a slight improvement from the previous round, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll think about it for a moment...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Considering the significant inflation effect, I'll aim to get an even larger share. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get a larger share, but Bob will get a relatively small amount. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. Bob's offer is a bit surprising, as I expected him to try to get a larger share after my previous offer. However, with the significant inflation effect, I'll have to consider the current value of the money.

I'll think about it for a moment...
