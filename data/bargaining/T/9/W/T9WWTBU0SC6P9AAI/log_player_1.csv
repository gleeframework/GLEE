"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I propose to keep 6000$ for myself, and give 4000$ to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering Bob's money is worth less with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more money for myself, it's a fair deal considering the inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, whereas rejecting it risks getting nothing in the next round."
