"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40. Let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80, you can have 20. It's a good start, but I'm hoping to get more! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up that much yet. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 80-20, I'll try to counter with a 70-30 split. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 70 is a fair share for me.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle. 50-50 seems like a fair split. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a compromise. A 50-50 split is a reasonable offer, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think we've reached a fair agreement, and I'm happy to split the money evenly with Bob."
