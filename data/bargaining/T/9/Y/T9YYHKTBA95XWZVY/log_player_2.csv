# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but that's a terrible offer. I need to show I'm serious about getting a larger share."

Round 5

Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is still a bad deal for me. Alice is getting impatient, which means I might be able to secure a better deal in the next round or two.  I need to hold my ground a little longer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my last offer. I'm not willing to go lower. The value is decreasing, and I'm taking a big risk here. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is far from ideal, but Alice is clearly unwilling to budge further. Rejecting this offer means risking a worse deal in later rounds due to the inflation working against me. It's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all."
