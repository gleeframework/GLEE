# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a bold opening move by Alice! While I appreciate the ""taste"" I'll get, I'm not ready to give her the lion's share just yet. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject her offer.

# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is trying to find some middle ground, but I'm not convinced she's being entirely reasonable.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Inflation is eating away at my potential gains, so I need to make a move that will give me a larger share in the present value. I'll try to take a bit more now, while the value of the money is still somewhat substantial.

# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to take a toll on my potential gains. I need to be cautious and think about the long-term consequences of this deal.
