6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think 60-40 is a fair split, considering the money loses value each round. Let's get this done!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6100.0,3900.0,"You tried 60-40, now it's my turn. Considering inflation, I think this is more than fair.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm still sticking with 60-40. This is getting ridiculous, let's just settle it now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6200.0,3800.0,You're still offering the same deal despite the money losing value for you? I think I deserve a bit more now.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,I'm tired of this back and forth. This is my final offer. It's better for both of us than getting nothing.  Let's end this.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here. Considering the inflation, I think I'm being generous.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"Okay, Alice, this is it. This is my final, final offer.  If you reject this, we both get nothing. I'm not playing this game any longer. ",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I'm not buying the 'final offer' threat. You'll keep playing as long as there's a chance to get something. And with inflation, 30% is still a good deal for you.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"Alice, I'm tired of this game. I'm giving you a chance to accept a small portion, or we both get nothing. The money is worth almost nothing to me now, so I'm willing to risk it all for a chance at a decent gain. This is my final offer.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"I think you're bluffing about being willing to risk it all. 20% of the original value is still better than nothing, and I'm not giving you a better deal than this.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
100.0,9900.0,"Alice, this is the last round. We both get nothing if we don't agree. I'm taking 99% for myself, and leaving you with 1% to show you I'm not bluffing. It's your decision.  ",Bob,12,
