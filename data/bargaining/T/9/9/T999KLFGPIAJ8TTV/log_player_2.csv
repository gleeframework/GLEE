**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more even split, time is working against us more than her. It's still beneficial to hold out for a better offer for a couple more rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is a fair and simple deal, Alice. Let's split it evenly and avoid losing even more to inflation."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering a 50/50 split is now the strongest strategic move. 

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value decreases significantly for both of us, but especially for Alice. Delay heavily favors Bob at this point.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair, and while Alice has been pushing for more, the increasing pressure of inflation makes it unlikely she'll risk further rounds for a marginally better deal. 
* **Clean Resolution:**  A clean split avoids further negotiation and potential stalemates, maximizing the chances of securing a deal before time runs out."
