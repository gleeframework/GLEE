"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. Considering the 50/50 split I proposed initially, I'm now inclined to accept a more skewed split in favor of Bob. However, 60/40 is a bit too much for me.

I'll decide to reject this offer.
