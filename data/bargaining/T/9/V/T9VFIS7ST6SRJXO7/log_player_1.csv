Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 40/60 split is more fair. It acknowledges your initial offer and gives me a larger share, but still leaves you with a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is more even than my initial proposal, I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split just yet. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal, especially with the increased inflation factor working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to come down to a 70/30 split.  This is a fair compromise, and it takes into account the inflation we're both facing.""}
