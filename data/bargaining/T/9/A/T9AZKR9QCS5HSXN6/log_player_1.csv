"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 65:35 ratio, with you receiving $350,000. This ensures a fair share while also providing a significant portion for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60:40 split, which still gives you a decent share while I take a slightly larger portion. It's a fair compromise, considering the initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
