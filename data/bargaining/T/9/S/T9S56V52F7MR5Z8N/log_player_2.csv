Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to get a bigger share to compensate. Since Alice's offer is 60% of the remaining amount, I'll try to get a bit more. However, I'll also consider the fact that Alice's offer is slightly better than my previous offer, and she rejected it. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.
