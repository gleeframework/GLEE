Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. This is my best offer yet. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but I have to accept.  

Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. Waiting any longer will result in an even worse deal.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows I'm feeling the pressure of the inflation and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better in future rounds. 

While I'm not happy with Alice getting the larger share, taking $3800 is better than risking an even smaller amount in a future round where the value has eroded further."
