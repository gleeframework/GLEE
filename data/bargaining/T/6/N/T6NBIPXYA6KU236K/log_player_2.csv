"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money this round, but we can negotiate in the future. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one, and a very low offer from Alice. While it seems tempting to take a small amount now, the potential future gains if we negotiate a fairer split outweigh this initial loss, especially with the inflation working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""That wasn't a very fair offer Alice. Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bigger share this time considering the inflation working against you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We both lose if we keep rejecting offers.  It's in our best interest to find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is coming around, and a 50/50 split is fair.  The inflation is starting to become a real factor, and waiting any longer to secure a deal would be too risky."
