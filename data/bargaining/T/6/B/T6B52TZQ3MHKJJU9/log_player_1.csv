"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a large share, knowing that the money will lose value for me with each round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk losing more value in the future."
