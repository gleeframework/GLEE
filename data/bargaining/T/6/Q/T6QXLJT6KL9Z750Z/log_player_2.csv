"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both be happy with this. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 2000$ gain is tempting, it's too early in the game to accept such an uneven split. It's better to see what Alice offers in the next round, as the inflation might make her more inclined to a fairer division."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's try a 50/50 split. It's the fairest way to start, and we can see if we can negotiate better terms later.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my initial proposal. Let's try a 3:2 split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation by using inflation to justify a more favorable split. While a 3:2 split is better than the initial offer, it's still not fair considering the inflation only affects Alice. We should continue to negotiate, as the remaining rounds will likely see more inflation, potentially forcing Alice to make a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the difference from the last round. I think a 55/45 split is a fair compromise, considering the impact of inflation on your share.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's try a 54:46 split. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but it's still not quite there.  With the significant inflation affecting Alice's share, I believe we can push for a more equitable outcome.  Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try a 52/48 split. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation affecting your share, and it brings us closer to a 50/50 split.""}
