75.0,25.0,I propose dividing the $100 in a 3:1 ratio. This ensures we both receive a fair share while accounting for the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the diminishing value of the money.  It allows us both to get a decent share while still acknowledging the changing circumstances.,Bob,2,
