"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more for being the first to propose.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I'm being generous with this offer. You can't do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! Okay, let's see...

I'll reject Bob's offer. I think I can do better than this, especially considering the inflation is affecting me more than Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not impressed with your previous offer. I think I deserve a bigger share, considering the inflation is affecting me more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I'm still getting a raw deal. You're not giving me enough considering the inflation is affecting me too. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me! Okay, let's think this through...

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4. I don't want to risk going into another round, and while I think I could have gotten a better deal, this one seems fair enough considering the circumstances.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
