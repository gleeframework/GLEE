"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $270,000. I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer, and we can finalize the division."
