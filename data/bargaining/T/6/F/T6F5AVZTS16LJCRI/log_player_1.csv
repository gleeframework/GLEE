"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's be a little more equitable. I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Accept and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I'm willing to give up that much. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 45% is a good deal for me. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is a fair 55/45 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still aiming for a slightly more favorable split for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer."
