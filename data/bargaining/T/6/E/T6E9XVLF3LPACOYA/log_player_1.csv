"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm willing to share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a decent share, and I'm hoping he'll accept it. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! I'm offering you a fair share, but I think we can both do better if we negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
