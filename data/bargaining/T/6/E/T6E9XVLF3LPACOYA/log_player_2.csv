"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'm willing to share! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what she'll offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script! I'm offering you a fair share, but I think we can both do better if we negotiate.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would love to keep pushing for more, the inflation is starting to hit hard. Taking a slightly reduced share is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
