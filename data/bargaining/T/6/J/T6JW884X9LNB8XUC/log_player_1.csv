"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI am offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message that suggests I'm trying to be fair but also want a bit more for myself. This is a strategic move, as I want to start with a higher offer to give room for negotiation, while also considering the inflation factor that will decrease the value of the money for me in each subsequent round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering your proposal in the last round. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth 10% less to me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. Accepting $45 would mean I'm getting less than half of the original amount, and considering the inflation, it's actually worth even less. I want to push for a better split, hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less to me than in the first round, and 20% less than the original value. I'm offering to take $57 and give Bob $43, trying to meet in the middle while considering the inflation factor. My message suggests that I'm willing to compromise, but still want to take into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's see how Bob responds!"
