"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose that I take 90 dollars and Bob takes 10. I'm hoping to secure the majority of the money in the first round, as the inflation will quickly diminish the value of the money in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more than 50 dollars, accepting this offer is the best option for me at this point. With each round, the value of the money diminishes, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything in future rounds.  50 dollars is a reasonable split considering the inflation factor."
