"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to settle for a 50/50 split. I'm hoping that he'll realize I'm not going to accept such a low offer, and he'll be more willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but still offer Bob a decent share. I'm hoping this will be more appealing than Bob's 50/50 split, and he'll be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm not going to settle for such a small share. I'm hoping that he'll realize that he needs to make a more generous offer if he wants to reach an agreement before the game ends."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still offering Bob a significant share. I'm hoping that he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the inflation takes a bigger bite out of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'm hoping that he'll realize that he needs to be more reasonable if he wants to reach an agreement before the game ends.  I'm determined to get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still offering Bob a fair share. I'm hoping that he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the inflation takes a bigger bite out of the money. We are running out of time, and I need to start getting serious about reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting ridiculous. I'm not going to accept such a low share, especially with inflation eating away at the value of the money. I'm going to stick to my strategy and try to get a better deal in the next round. I'm starting to get worried that we might run out of time before we reach an agreement, but I'm not going to give in to his unreasonable demands."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We are getting close to the end, and I am starting to feel the pressure.  I have to try and be more reasonable. Bob is not going to accept my lower offers anymore, and I need to get his offer accepted. I think 50/50 is the best I can hope for at this point."
