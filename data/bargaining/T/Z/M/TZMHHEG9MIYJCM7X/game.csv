300000.0,700000.0,"Considering the inflation, my share is now worth less, but yours is worth significantly less. I think 70-30 is a reasonable split, taking into account the decreasing value for both of us.",Bob,4,

400000.0,600000.0,"I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't accept your last offer. Let's split it 40-60. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation and our previous negotiations. It's better than the risk of further rounds, where the value of our gains will continue to decrease.",Alice,5,
