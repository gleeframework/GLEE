"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure, since the money is worth less to Bob, a small amount is better than nothing.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like more, I think it's in my best interest to accept this offer. With inflation, my gains are decreasing each round, and Bob's offer is still a significant amount. It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
