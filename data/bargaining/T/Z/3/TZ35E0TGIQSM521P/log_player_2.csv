Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both lose if we wait. I'm being reasonable, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a good deal, considering the inflation. I'd rather take the 42 dollars now than risk losing more value in the next rounds."
