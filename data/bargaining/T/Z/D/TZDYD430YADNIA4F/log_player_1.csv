"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This offer gives me almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1. Since the inflation is unknown, I want to secure as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though the inflation doesn't impact my share, Bob's offer is still better than the potential outcome if I reject and he gets to make the next offer. He may be tempted to take a larger share next time since he's getting a better deal now due to the inflation on his end."
