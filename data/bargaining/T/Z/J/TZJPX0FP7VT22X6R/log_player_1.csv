"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 80% of the original $500,000 I would have gotten in the first round.

On the other hand, Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 95% of the original $625,000 he would have gotten in the first round.

Considering this, I think I'll...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal.

Considering the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, where I'll get $420,000 and Bob will get $580,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the 48.8% decrease in value, I'll have to adjust my thinking again. If I accept this offer, I'll get $300,000, which is worth only 51.2% of the original $500,000 I would have gotten in the first round.

On the other hand, Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 88.4% of the original $625,000 he would have gotten in the first round.

Given the significant difference in the value of our potential gains, I think I'll...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal.

Considering the continued inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I'll aim for an even more aggressive split this time. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 360000, ""bob_gain"": 640000}

I'm proposing a 36/64 split, where I'll get $360,000 and Bob will get $640,000."
