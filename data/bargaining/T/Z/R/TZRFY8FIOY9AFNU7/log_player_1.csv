I propose to take 9000 dollars and give 1000 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 
I'm going to offer 8000 dollars for myself and 2000 for Bob.  Since we're both losing money due to inflation, I think it's fair to take a slightly larger share this round."
