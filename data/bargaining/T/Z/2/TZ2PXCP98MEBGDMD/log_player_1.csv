"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with an 80-20 split in favor of Alice. This seems fair considering the risk and potential for inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 50/50, considering we're both making the same proposal and taking the same risk. This way, we both get an equal share and can walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
