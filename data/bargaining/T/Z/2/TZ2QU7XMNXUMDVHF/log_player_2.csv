Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This offer still benefits us both, even considering the inflation.

# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering how much value we've both lost to inflation already. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential gains. Accepting Alice's offer of $4,800, while not ideal, is better than risking another round where the value diminishes further. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Another round means Bob's potential gains shrink drastically, while Alice's losses are less severe.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob can propose a deal in Round 6 that Alice will accept, leading to potentially even greater losses.
* **""Final Offer"" Psychology:** Alice stating this is her final offer implies she's unlikely to budge further. 

While not a perfect outcome, accepting now cuts losses and provides some certainty in the face of a rapidly devaluing situation."
