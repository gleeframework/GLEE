"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see where we go from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority, but I'll let you keep a small share. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's being a bit greedy, isn't he?

Considering the inflation effect, my $100,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $90,000 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with a smaller share. I'll accept Bob's offer.
