"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a 99.9% to 0.1% split in my favor. This is a very generous offer, given that I have the power to simply refuse your offer and let the game continue. I believe it's in your best interest to accept, as the value of the money will decrease with every round for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer given the decreasing value of the money. It's better to take what I can get than to risk getting nothing."
