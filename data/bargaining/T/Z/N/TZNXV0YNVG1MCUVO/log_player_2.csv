Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

We're getting into dangerous territory here. While accepting would get me something, it's a severely reduced amount due to inflation. Alice is clearly trying to wait me out. I need to push for a more agreeable split soon, or I risk getting even less."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This is my final offer before inflation makes this pointless for me.  Let's be reasonable.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I think I've compromised enough 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but with the inflation rate, waiting any longer is too risky. Alice is unlikely to offer me anything significantly better, and I'll lose even more to inflation if I reject. It's not ideal, but it's better to secure something now."
