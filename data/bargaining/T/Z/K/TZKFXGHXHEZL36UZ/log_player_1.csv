"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than it was in the first round, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. The 300,000 I would gain is not enough for me, considering the reduced value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to get a larger share of the money to compensate for the reduced value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can both get a fair share before the value drops further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to get a better deal before the next round of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, my gain is now worth even less. I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the reduced value, I'll accept Bob's offer. 450,000 is not a bad deal, and it's better than risking the value dropping even further.
