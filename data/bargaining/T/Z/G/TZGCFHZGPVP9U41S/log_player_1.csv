Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I'll start by proposing a division where I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I'll reject Bob's offer in this round. Although Bob thinks this is a fair split considering the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds. The 5% decrease in value for me is a significant factor, and I'd like to explore other options before accepting this division.\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my rejection and the details for the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nIn this round, I'm proposing a division where I receive $5,200 and Bob receives $4,800. Given the 5% decrease in value for me due to inflation, I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the original fair split I proposed in Round 1. My message to Bob is ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle!"" to convey my willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to this offer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be reasonable, but I still need a larger share to compensate for the upcoming inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer in this round. Although Bob claims to be willing to be reasonable, the division still favors them, and the upcoming inflation will continue to decrease the value of my share. Considering the current 14.26% decrease in value for me, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next rounds.\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my rejection and the details for the next round."

Despite the inflation affecting the value of my share, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest and most straightforward solution. My message to Bob is ""50/50 is the fairest split, considering the circumstances!"" to emphasize the equal division and encourage Bob to accept this offer.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to this proposal."
