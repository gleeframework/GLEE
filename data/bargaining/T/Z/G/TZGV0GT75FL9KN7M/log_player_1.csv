Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and reasonable!""}\n\nHow's that? I'm trying to start with a relatively balanced offer to see how Bob reacts."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not ready to accept an offer that gives Bob more than half of the money, especially considering the inflation that's affecting my share more than his. Let's see if I can make a better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous here.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than that. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is mounting! With the inflation eating away at my potential gains, I need to think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm starting to think that 45 might be the best I can get. I'll accept this offer before things get any worse.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
