Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split to start fair. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants an equal split now!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give up that much. I'll make a new offer.""

I'm not convinced that an equal split is in my best interest, so I'll reject this offer and make a new one."
