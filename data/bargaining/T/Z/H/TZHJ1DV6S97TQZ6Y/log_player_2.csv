"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer still gives you a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd rather try to get a better deal, even if it means risking a decrease in the money's value due to inflation. Alice's offer doesn't seem fair enough to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more in my favor, considering the inflation that will occur if the game continues. I'll offer Alice a bit less than what she offered me, while still being somewhat reasonable. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The money is losing value, Bob. Take this offer before it shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll try to push for a better deal, even though the money's value is decreasing. Alice's offer still doesn't seem good enough, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Alice. I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself, while still being somewhat reasonable. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, I need a better deal.""}"
