I'm not convinced that splitting it 50/50 is the best option, especially considering the inflation rates. I'd like to propose a different offer."

I'm not willing to accept an offer that's even worse than the initial one I made. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation and get more than his fair share. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the changing value of the money."

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that's so heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I think he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a disproportionate share of the money. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the changing value of the money and tries to find a more balanced split."

# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, you need to make a serious offer now 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that's this bad. The value of the money has decreased significantly, and I think Bob is trying to take advantage of that to get an unfair share.

I'm not willing to accept an offer that's this bad. The value of the money has decreased significantly, and I think Bob is trying to take advantage of that to get an unfair share. I'd rather take the risk of not getting anything than accept an offer that's this unfair."
