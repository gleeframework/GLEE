  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split."

# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully...

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive move. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're still too high, meet me at 55-45""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself, with a message that suggests he should meet me at a more favorable ratio for me."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get me to meet him at the same ratio as before.

Considering the inflation and the new offer, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. I'm not willing to meet him at 45-55, especially since I know the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll try to make another move to get a better deal."

  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, meet me at 52-48 or walk away""
}
```

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is willing to meet me at the 52-48 ratio I suggested earlier.

Considering the severe inflation and the new offer, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. With the value of the money decreasing rapidly, I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come. This 52-48 split seems like the best deal I can get, and I'm willing to take it."
