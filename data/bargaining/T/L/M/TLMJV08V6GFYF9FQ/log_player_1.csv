"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""A fair split, considering the initial amount""}

I'm proposing that I receive 800,000 and Bob receives 200,000. I think this is a fair split, considering the initial amount of 1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decreasing value of money, I propose a split that compensates for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. Considering the decreasing value of money, I think I should get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer didn't take into account the decreasing value of money effectively, I'll make a new proposal that takes it into account.

{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000, ""message"": ""A revised split to account for inflation's impact""}

I'm proposing that I receive 720,000 and Bob receives 280,000. This split takes into account the 20% decrease in the value of money and gives me a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation."
