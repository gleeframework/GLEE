}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 80/20 in my favor, with me taking $800,000 and Bob taking $200,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
