Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a middle ground. This offer is fair, considering the diminishing value of the money. Let's avoid losing everything! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to inch his way to a more favorable outcome. While the offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, accepting now would still give Bob a significant advantage, especially with the increasing effects of inflation. It's time to hold firm and demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a fair share."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair compromise. Time is running out, let's make a deal!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly aiming for a 55/45 split in his favor.  This offer is slightly better for Alice than his proposed split, but also signals a willingness to compromise.  Adding a time pressure element to the message may encourage him to accept and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking. We need to agree. This offer is a fair compromise, let's not let the money slip away. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time is becoming a critical factor.  While Bob is still getting a slightly better deal, accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout for both of us. Rejecting this offer means we're entering very risky territory where we might end up with nothing."
