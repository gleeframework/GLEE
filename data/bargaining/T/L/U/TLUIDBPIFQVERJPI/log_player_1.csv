"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll give you a bit more, but not too much! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'd be getting $400,000, which is $100,000 less than my initial proposal.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $400,000, and he'd be getting $600,000. It's still a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for less than 50% of the total.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You gave me 400k last round, I'll take 550k this time!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in settling for a slightly higher amount to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing for more, I'll give you a bit less, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My $550,000 from the previous round is now worth significantly less.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $300,000, which is a substantial decrease from my previous proposal. While it's a decent offer, I'm not sure if I want to settle for so much less.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting more than 50%? I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in settling for a slightly higher share to avoid further negotiation."
