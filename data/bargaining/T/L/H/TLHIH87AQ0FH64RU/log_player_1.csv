"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 6000$ and Bob getting 4000$.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
With inflation, the money is worth less each round. This offer gives me a decent amount and is a fair split.  It's time to take it."
