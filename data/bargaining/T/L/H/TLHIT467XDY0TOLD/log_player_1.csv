"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose to take $9,000 and give $1,000 to Bob. This is a fair starting point considering I'm the one taking the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and potentially leading to a less favorable outcome for both of us in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the most strategic choice.  The inflation penalty is starting to bite, and rejecting this offer risks getting nothing at all in the end."
