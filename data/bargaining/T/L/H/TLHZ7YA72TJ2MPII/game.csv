6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  It's better to secure something now than risk inflation eating away our potential gains.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe we can find a more equitable split. Let's try 6000 for me and 4000 for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also confident we can reach a fair agreement.",Bob,2,
,,"Thanks for the offer, Bob, but it's not quite fair considering the inflation working against me. I'm willing to negotiate, but we need to find a better balance.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you.  This factors in the inflation hitting me harder and still gives us both a decent share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, we're getting closer to the end of the game, and the inflation is hurting both of us.  I'm willing to take a bit more, 7000 for me, and leave you 3000. Let's avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. This offer is fair, considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand the pressure of the inflation, but your offer is heavily skewed in your favor. I'm willing to accept a smaller share than my initial proposal, but 3000 is too low. Let's be realistic and aim for a more balanced outcome.",Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. 50/50 is the fairest option, especially with the increasing inflation.  We both benefit from a fair deal right now.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
