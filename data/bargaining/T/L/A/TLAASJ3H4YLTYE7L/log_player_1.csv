Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly and minimize the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a serious concern.  Accepting this offer guarantees me at least half the original value, which is better than risking getting a worse deal in the next round."
