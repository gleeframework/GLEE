"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 in a 60-40 ratio, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this down the middle, it's fair and we both get a good amount! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it down the middle just yet. I'd like to make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I think we should be closer to an even split. Let's try this and see if we can agree! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to reassess my priorities.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to take it rather than risking further inflation and potentially getting less in the next round."
