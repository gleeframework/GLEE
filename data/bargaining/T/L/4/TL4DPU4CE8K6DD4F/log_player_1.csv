"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slight risk, but I think a 60/40 split is fairer. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, I'll have to consider the value of the money I'll be getting in the future rounds. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the immediate value.

However, I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I'd like to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. I'll make a counteroffer: 55/45""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up more than 5% of the total. Let's see if you'll accept!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still thinking a 60/40 split is fair, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at 55/45.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, but still more than mine. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, especially since it's his final offer.

However, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer, trying to get closer to the 50/50 split I initially proposed.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced this is the best deal. I'll meet you at 52/48, but no lower.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

  ""alice_gain"": 5200,

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. This is my final offer: 52/48. I think it's a fair deal, and I'm not willing to go any lower.""
}
