"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather wait for a better offer. Bob's offer is a bit lower than my initial offer, so I'll reject it. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 5% lower than mine, I'll make a slightly higher offer to account for the inflation. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 610000,
  ""bob_gain"": 390000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial offer, but still a bit lower. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think it's still a good idea to wait for a better offer. Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation rate. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to make a slightly higher offer to account for the decreasing value of Bob's offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 620000,
  ""bob_gain"": 380000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 568000 
# Bob gain: 432000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think it's getting harder for Bob to make a good offer. I'll accept this offer, as it's the best one I've seen so far.
