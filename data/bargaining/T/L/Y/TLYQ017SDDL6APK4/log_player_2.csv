# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are becoming less advantageous to her due to inflation. While her offer is closer to a 50/50 split, I believe I can still get a better deal by waiting her out a little longer."
