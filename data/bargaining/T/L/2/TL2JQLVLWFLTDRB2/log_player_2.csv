"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since it's my turn next round and inflation will hurt my earnings.

# Alice gain: 60

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation. It's a bit closer to a 50/50 split while still accounting for the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. I'm taking a loss due to inflation, but it's better than risking even less in further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
