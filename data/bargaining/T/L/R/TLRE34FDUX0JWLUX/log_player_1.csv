```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm framing it as a fair share, hoping Bob will accept!"

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh? That's a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if I want to give up my advantage. I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering the offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect more!""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give Bob, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit desperate, and I can sense the value of his offer decreasing with each round.

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a comeback, but I'm not convinced. I think I can do better than this.

I've been keeping track of the inflation, and I know that the value of Bob's offer is decreasing rapidly. I'll reject this offer and try to get an even better deal.
