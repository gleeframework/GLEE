"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000, and I'll keep $900,000.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $180,000.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's a better compromise than my initial offer. I'll accept it.
