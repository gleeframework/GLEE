Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than 40%. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still in her favor. Given the faster rate of inflation for me (Bob), holding out a bit longer might push Alice to offer a larger share, even if the nominal amount decreases."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. I'm offering 58/42 â€“ a smaller gap, but still in my favor. Let's close this deal!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:**  I'm increasing the pressure by emphasizing the shrinking pot due to inflation. 
* **Slight Concession:** I'm moving slightly closer to her previous offer (55/45) to show willingness to negotiate, but not by much.
* **Strategic Timing:** Offering a slightly better deal just before my inflation hit becomes significant (50% by Round 5) might make it more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. With each round, we both lose more. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The rate of inflation is severely impacting my (Bob's) potential gains. Waiting any longer risks a significantly smaller payout, even if I manage to secure a slightly larger percentage in future rounds.
* **Fair Offer:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair. While I was aiming for a larger share initially, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable amount that's better than risking a complete loss by continuing to hold out. 
* **Time Pressure:** We are now past the halfway point of the rounds.  Delaying further increases the risk of walking away with nothing."
