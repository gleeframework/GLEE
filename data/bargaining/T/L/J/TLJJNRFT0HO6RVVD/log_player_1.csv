Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective gains in terms of the original $1,000,000.

In this case, my gain of 300,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is 0.95 * 300,000 = 285,000. Bob's gain of 700,000 is still 700,000.

I'll reject this offer because I'm getting less than I initially proposed in the first round, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.
