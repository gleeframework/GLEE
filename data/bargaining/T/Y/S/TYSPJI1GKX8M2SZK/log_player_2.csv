Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the less Bob's potential share is worth. Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of getting nothing.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share and presented this as her ""final offer."" There's a real chance she won't budge further, forcing a stalemate and a losing outcome for both.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees Bob a reduced but still substantial amount. Rejecting carries the high risk of walking away with nothing if a favorable agreement can't be reached. 

It's a tough decision, but in this scenario, taking the guaranteed, albeit smaller, reward is the safer and more rational choice."
