"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the money upfront to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was slightly more favorable to him, I'll make a more aggressive offer this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm hoping to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less with each round, and try to get a bigger share now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger hit on my end, I'm getting desperate to get a deal done. Bob's offer is still not great for me, but it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.

I'll accept this offer.
