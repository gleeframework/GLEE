Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a small share to get started!  I think it's better to take a small piece now than risk getting nothing later with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy! I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to stick with a similar split as Bob's offer, but I'm going to give myself a bigger share. I think this is fair since the money is losing value for Bob, but not for me."
