Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer is a good compromise to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his demands while taking advantage of the inflation affecting me. Accepting now would mean settling for considerably less than my initial offer. It's a risk, but holding out a little longer might push Bob towards a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest solution. We both lose if this drags on.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming increasingly detrimental with each round. It's time to offer a deal that is impossible for Bob to refuse - a 50/50 split. While not ideal considering the initial rounds, this ensures I get something and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
