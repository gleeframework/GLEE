"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to reach an agreement quickly due to the higher inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer stands. The clock is ticking, and the longer we wait, the less valuable this deal becomes for both of us. Don't let greed cloud your judgment. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting a 40/60 split sets a bad precedent and significantly undervalues my position.  Alice knows my losses are greater with each round, and she's trying to exploit that.  I need to show some resolve and make it clear I'm willing to risk it for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about finding a fair solution. This offer gives you a clear advantage, but acknowledges the shrinking pot. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:**  I'm raising my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but not capitulate. 
* **Deadline Pressure:**  Emphasizing the ""shrinking pot"" reminds Alice that her gains are also diminishing with each passing round.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I want to project a willingness to compromise, even though I'm holding firm on getting a better deal than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer is my bottom line. Take it now, or the deal will only worsen for both of us as time runs out. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to create a false sense of urgency. While a 42/58 split is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to call her bluff and demonstrate I'm willing to risk it for a more equitable outcome. Accepting now would set a bad precedent and likely lead to an unfavorable final split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, enough is enough. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution.  Take it now, or let's both risk walking away with nothing.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Stakes Are High:**  With more than half the rounds gone, the pressure is mounting, and the risk of getting nothing is very real.
* **Projecting Strength:** By offering an even split, I'm showing Alice that I'm not desperate and I'm willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Appeal to Reason:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair, and it's the easiest solution to agree on.  Continuing to haggle could be disastrous for both of us."
