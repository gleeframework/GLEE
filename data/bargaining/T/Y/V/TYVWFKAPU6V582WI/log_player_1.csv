"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm trying to get a good chunk of the money upfront!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not getting a better deal. But the offer is still better than my initial one, and I don't want to risk going to another round with inflation eating into my potential gain.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
