"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, I'm being generous by not taking more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a game of chicken with the inflation.  While she's right that my potential gains are decreasing, hers are not increasing.  I need to show some firmness to avoid getting stuck with a terrible deal in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  I've rejected Alice's attempts to exploit the inflation. Now it's time to put my foot down and show I'm serious about a fair deal.
* **Simplicity:** The 50/50 split is easy to understand and leaves no room for argument about fairness. 
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the potential gains decrease.  A firm offer now might push Alice to accept before the stakes get even lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a better one 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

* **Alice's Game:** She's clearly using the inflation against me, and my ""final offer"" bluff didn't work. She's betting I'll crack under pressure.
* **Time:**  5 rounds left. While the money shrinks, there's still a chance to negotiate something better than 38.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting guarantees something, but it's a low amount. Rejecting risks getting even less, but there's a chance of a better deal.

**Decision:**  {""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  I need to signal I'm not giving in *that* easily. Rejecting this might make her nervous and offer something slightly better in the next round, as she wouldn't want to risk me rejecting until the end. It's a gamble, but I need to try."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Time is running out. This is my REAL final offer. Let's end this before we both lose.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession (Slight):**  I'm moving closer to her desired split to show I'm willing to compromise, but not by much. 
* **Urgency:**  Emphasizing the shrinking pot might push her to accept.
* **Finality:**  No more bluffing. This is it. Accepting failure is better than getting a worse deal in the last round out of desperation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not feeling the pressure, every round is costing you more than me 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is playing hardball, but I need to stay strong. Let's break it down:

* **Her Tactic:**  She's using psychological pressure, trying to make me doubt my position.
* **Time Factor:** Only 3 rounds left. Accepting now still guarantees *something*.
* **The Gap:** 35 is significantly less than what I was aiming for. 

**Decision:** {""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

1. **Dangerous Precedent:** Accepting now signals I'll cave to pressure. She might offer even less in the next round.
2. **Last Chance:** I have two rounds to make counter-offers. That's a chance to either get her to 40 or, at worst, accept knowing I pushed as hard as I could.
3. **Worst-Case Scenario:** If I reject and she keeps offering 35, I can always accept in the final round to avoid getting zero. It's risky, but the potential loss is minimal compared to the potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Two rounds left, Alice. This is the best you'll get.  Don't be greedy.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is my last realistic attempt to get a somewhat acceptable deal. 
* **Appeal to Reason:** I'm reminding her that  getting 60 is better than risking 0 if we fail to agree. 
* **No More Bluffs:**  I need to show I'm serious about this being my bottom line.

This is a high-stakes gamble. If Alice rejects this, I'm left with two terrible options: accept a worse deal in the last round or walk away with nothing. But I've held out this long, I need to see this through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm not backing down 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","This is it, the moment of truth. Alice is ruthless, but I need to stay rational.

* **Her Position:** She's made it clear she thinks she has the upper hand. 
* **My Options:**  Accept 30, offer something in the last round (likely worse), or risk getting 0.
* **The Stakes:**  It's come down to a significant loss (70/30 split) or a potential total loss.

**Decision:** {""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but accepting this is the least risky option. Here's why:

1. **Guaranteed Loss Minimized:** Accepting 30 stings, but it's *something*. Rejecting and getting 0 is a worse outcome, both financially and strategically.
2. **Alice Won't Budge:**  Her message is clear. She's confident in her position and there's no logical reason to assume she'll offer more in the last round.
3. **Avoiding Complete Failure:**  Walking away with nothing after 11 rounds feels worse than accepting a bad deal. This way, at least I'm acknowledging the reality of the situation and cutting my losses. 

This wasn't the outcome I wanted, but sometimes in negotiations, you have to choose between bad and worse. Alice played the game well, exploiting the time pressure and my initial bluffing. It's a tough lesson learned about the power dynamics of negotiation and the dangers of overplaying your hand."
