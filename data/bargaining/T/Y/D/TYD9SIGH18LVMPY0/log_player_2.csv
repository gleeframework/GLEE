"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation rates. I'll take a bit more since my inflation rate is lower. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm looking to maximize my gains.  Since the inflation rate is much higher for me, I need to be more aggressive and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation rates.  Let's end this quickly so we can both benefit from the diminishing value of the money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, especially on your end, this offer is more generous than the last. Let's settle. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still like a bigger share, the inflation is hurting me significantly. This offer is better than the previous one, and it's likely that rejecting it will result in a worse deal for me in the next round. I'll accept to minimize the losses."
