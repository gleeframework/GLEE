"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm proposing a division of 9000 for myself and 1000 for Bob. This is a generous offer in the first round, as the money is worth the same for both of us. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair! I understand that he's taking advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to accept being taken advantage of. I will reject this offer and hope for a better division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm offering 8100 for myself and 1900 for Bob.  This is a revised offer considering the inflation that has occurred.  I'm still offering a majority of the money, but I'm adjusting it to reflect the fact that the money is worth less for me than it is for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage. I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer. I'll try to make a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710} 
```

I'm offering 7290 for myself and 2710 for Bob.  This is an adjusted offer considering the increased inflation. While I'm taking a bigger share, I'm still offering Bob a substantial amount.  It's a more fair division than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair.  While I'm aware of the inflation, I'm not going to accept such a large disparity. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439} 
```

I'm offering 6561 for myself and 3439 for Bob.  I'm still aiming for a majority share due to the inflation, but I'm trying to be reasonable, offering Bob a fair share as we enter the final stages of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair, even though I'm losing more value due to inflation. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096}
```

With the inflation getting worse, I'm offering 5904 for myself and 4096 for Bob. This is a more balanced offer, considering the shrinking value of money for both of us. We're running out of time, and this is a good opportunity for us to secure some money before it's too late."
