Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. 50/50 split seems reasonable, don't you think?  We can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
