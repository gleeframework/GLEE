I'm going to be greedy and try to get as much as I can on the first round, hoping Bob will be happy with a tiny bit.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

I'm still aiming high, but I'm acknowledging that Bob is trying to take the lion's share. I'll try to get a bit closer to a 50/50 split this time."

Round 4

Bob's offer is slightly better than his last one, but still pretty unfair.  I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal, as the inflation is going to hurt me more the longer we go on."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm willing to concede a little more ground to try and get a deal done before the inflation really starts to bite."

This is the best deal I'm likely to get now, and I'm starting to worry about the inflation seriously hurting me. It's time to cut my losses and accept this even split."
