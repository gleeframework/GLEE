"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $100, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, my gain of $20 is equivalent to 20 / 0.95 = $21.05 in the first round's value. And Bob's gain of $80 is equivalent to 80 / 0.9 = $88.89 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me again, I'll aim to get a slightly better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle this time.""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the current value of $100, which is a bit more than my previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, I want most of the money now! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is getting aggressive!

Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round's money:

My gain of $10 is worth 10 / 0.8626 = $11.61 in the first round's value.
Bob's gain of $90 is worth 90 / 0.729 = $123.67 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll think carefully. I'm starting to get concerned that Bob might be trying to take advantage of the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me again, I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet. I'll take a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping you'll meet me in the middle.""
}
```

This offer gives me 30% of the current value of $100, which is a bit more than my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise this time."
