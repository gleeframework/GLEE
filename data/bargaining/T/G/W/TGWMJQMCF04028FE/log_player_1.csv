"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is 10% of the initial amount. This leaves me with $9,000, which is 90% of the initial amount. I'm hoping Bob will find this a reasonable starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to give you a higher share, but I need something in return. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as keen on the offer as I was initially.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share, even with the reduced value of money. I think I can do better than that. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split considering the reduced value of money""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is 30% of the current value of the money, and I'm taking $7,000 for myself, which is 70% of the current value. I'm hoping Bob will find this a more acceptable offer."

# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money continues to decrease!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with the 58% share I'm being offered, even with the reduced value of money. I think I can still negotiate a better deal. I'd like to make another counteroffer in the next round."
