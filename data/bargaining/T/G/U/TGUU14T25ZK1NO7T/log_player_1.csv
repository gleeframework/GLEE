"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. This is a generous offer, considering that the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game quickly.\n\n###\nPlease let me know what Bob decides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, that's the fairest way to do it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, Bob's half is actually worth less than my half. I think I can get a better deal if I make another proposal.\n\n###\nPlease let me know what happens next.\n\n###\n\n###\nMy next proposal will be:\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\nI'll offer Bob 45% of the money, which is a bit less than half, but considering the inflation, it's actually a generous offer. I hope he'll accept it.\n\n###\nPlease let me know what Bob decides."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\nMy offer is:\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\nI'll offer Bob 45% of the money, which is a bit less than half, but considering the inflation, it's actually a generous offer. I hope he'll accept it.\n\n###\nPlease let me know what Bob decides.\n\n###\nI've taken into account that the money is worth 20% less to Bob now, so I think this offer is quite reasonable.\n\n###\nWaiting for Bob's response..."
