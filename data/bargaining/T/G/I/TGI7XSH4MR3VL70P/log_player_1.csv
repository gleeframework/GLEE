Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's be more realistic. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  The money will be worth less if we wait any longer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
