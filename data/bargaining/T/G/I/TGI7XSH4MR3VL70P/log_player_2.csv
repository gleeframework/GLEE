Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I propose we split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can end this quickly.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's be more realistic. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  The money will be worth less if we wait any longer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to go for a 50/50 split.  This is a fair compromise and avoids further inflation losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
