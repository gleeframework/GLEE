400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, that's a pretty uneven split you proposed. Let's be realistic.  I'm proposing a more balanced 60/40 split in my favor.  It benefits us both to take this deal now before inflation eats away at the value.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept a 60/40 split, but it needs to be in my favor this time. We're both losing money with each round, so let's be reasonable and take this deal.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're getting closer, but your offer still undervalues my position.  How about a 55/45 split? It's a strong deal for me, but it still leaves you with a significant sum considering the shrinking pot.",Bob,4,

550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, let's try a 55/45 split, but in my favor this time. We're getting closer to a fair deal with each round.  Accept this and we can both avoid further losses from inflation.",Alice,5,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and this back-and-forth isn't helping either of us.  I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split - a slight edge to me, but closer to the middle ground.  Let's be done with this and secure something before inflation destroys the value further.",Bob,6,
