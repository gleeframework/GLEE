"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll give you a small chunk too 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the values are now:

Alice gain: 2000
Bob gain: 8000

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. I'll accept this offer.
