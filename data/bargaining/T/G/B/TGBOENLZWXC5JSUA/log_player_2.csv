"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'll be more reasonable in the future. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because Alice is taking 90% of the money, which is not a fair division. I believe I can get a better offer in the next rounds. Additionally, with 12 rounds to go, I'm not worried about the inflation yet, and I'm willing to take the risk to get a more reasonable share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's try a more reasonable split. We can both benefit, and it's still early in the game.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's time to be more fair.  Let's split the money evenly and move on. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\nI'm accepting this offer because Alice is now offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair division of the money. Considering the inflation, I think it's wise to accept this offer now, as the value of the money will continue to decrease in future rounds. I don't want to risk losing more value by rejecting this reasonable offer."
