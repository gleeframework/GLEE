"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4000 / 0.9 = $4444.44 in the first round's value.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to negotiate further, as I'd prefer a higher share considering the inflation effect."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'd like to keep a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still keeping a larger share for myself."

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3500 is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $3500 / 0.729 = $4805.82 in the first round's value.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the value of money is decreasing""

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3000 is worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $3000 / 0.5905 = $5063.53 in the first round's value.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
