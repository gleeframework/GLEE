"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is wildly unfair, even with the 20% inflation penalty. I'll take my chances and see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial proposal, hoping to find a middle ground. It's still a good deal for him, considering the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I know inflation is hitting him hard, but I can't accept such a lopsided deal.  I'm hoping he comes back with a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding onto the majority of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers will only make his share smaller."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to being fair, but it's still too low for me to accept. I'm not willing to settle for a deal where he's getting a much larger share than me, even with the inflation penalty. I'm hoping he'll offer something more equitable soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding onto the majority of the money. I think it's time Bob starts seeing the value in accepting a deal, even if it's not ideal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not going to accept it yet. I'm hoping we can find a more equitable solution. I'm starting to feel like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, and I won't be a victim of his greed."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm offering an even split. It's the fairest option, given the inflation and the dwindling time. I hope Bob recognizes this and finally agrees."
