"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we both get something, and I'm showing good faith by offering a relatively small amount to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly.  I think this is a fair starting point for us to discuss. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is now worth 20% less, my initial offer of $8,000 is now worth $6,400. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering my initial offer was already generous. However, I'm willing to consider a more even split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer and want to make a new proposal in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer of $6,400 is now worth $5,120. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly, considering the inflation. This way, we both get a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,000, and keeping $5,000 for myself, trying to find a more balanced split."
