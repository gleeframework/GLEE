"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and give Bob 40 dollars. This is a pretty generous offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 dollars is now worth 32 dollars (80% of 40). I'm not thrilled about that, but it's still a decent offer.

I'll accept this offer.
