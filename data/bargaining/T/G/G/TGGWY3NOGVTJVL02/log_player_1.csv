}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, as I'm the one taking the risk of inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept a 60-40 split in Bob's favor, especially since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less. I'll reject this offer.
