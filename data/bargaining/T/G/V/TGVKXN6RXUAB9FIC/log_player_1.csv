"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take the $1,000 and let's negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself, as a starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's start negotiating from here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth 10% less, so my gain of $5000 is actually worth $4,500.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I'm willing to meet in the middle."
