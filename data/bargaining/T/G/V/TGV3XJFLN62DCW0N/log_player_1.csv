"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $200,000 in the first round's money, which is still worth $200,000 after inflation. But Bob would gain $800,000, which is worth $720,000 after inflation.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's previous offer was 80-20, I'll try to adjust the ratio a bit to my advantage. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values after inflation for Bob's offer:

Alice's gain: $300,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $700,000 * 0.727 (1 - 0.271 inflation) = $508,900

I'd gain $300,000, which is worth $300,000, but Bob would gain $508,900, which is worth $508,900.

I think I can do better than this, so I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since Bob's previous offer was 70-30, I'll try to push for a more even split. Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values after inflation for Bob's offer:

Alice's gain: $350,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: $650,000 * 0.596 (1 - 0.404 inflation) = $386,900

I'd gain $350,000, which is worth $350,000, but Bob would gain $386,900, which is worth $386,900.

This offer is still a bit too skewed towards Bob, so I'll reject it.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 620000,
  ""bob_gain"": 380000
