"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can start the game with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small edge, but I'm not going all in just yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $5,000 from the first round is still worth $5,000, but Bob's $5,000 is now worth $4,000.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, the money is still worth the same as in the first round for me ($5,000), but Bob's $6,000 is now worth $4,800.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and let's move forward!""
}
```"
