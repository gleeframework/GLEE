Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering a pretty uneven split. This is because the inflation will affect me more than Bob, so I need to get as much as I can early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer. Even though the money is worth less to me now, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. The inflation is working in my favor in the long run, and I'll likely get a better offer if I reject."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  After the last round, I'm hoping Bob is ready to compromise.  A 50/50 split seems fair considering the inflation, and it avoids further risk."
