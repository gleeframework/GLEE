"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation disadvantage I have. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is reasonable, I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation rates. Let's see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation rates. We both get a good amount, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was tempting, but still favors you too much in the long run. I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I need a bit more to offset the faster inflation I face. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, which is what I'd ideally like.  While I'm not thrilled about taking less than my initial offer,  I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation.  Let's settle for this and move on."
