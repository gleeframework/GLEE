"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split, especially since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than mine. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money. With the money worth 14.26% less for me, I'm not as eager to give up a larger share as I was in the earlier rounds. However, Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is still a relatively even split considering the current state of the money.
