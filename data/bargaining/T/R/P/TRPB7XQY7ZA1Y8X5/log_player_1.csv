"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split, as it's the fairest way to divide the money.  Let's get this done quickly before the value decreases too much. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this 50/50 split.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to go 50/50. I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills so far.""
