"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject this offer since it's still not favorable to me. The money I gain is worth 20% less, but Bob's gain remains the same.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm offering to take 48% of the remaining $1,000,000 and leave 52% for Bob."
