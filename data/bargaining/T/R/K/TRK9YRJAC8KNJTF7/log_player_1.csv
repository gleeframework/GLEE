"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In round 1, I had proposed a gain of $700,000, which was worth $700,000. Now, with 5% inflation, that's equivalent to $665,000.

Bob's offer is $600,000, which is more than my equivalent gain from round 1. I'll accept this offer.
