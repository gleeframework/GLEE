Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000. Since I'm the one making the proposal, I want to maximize my share while still giving Bob something to avoid him rejecting it outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though I would have earned 9000 in the previous round, due to inflation my share is worth 10% less now. Bob is offering an equal share which would mean that I get 5000, which is higher than the 4500 that I would get if I rejected his offer and made a proposal myself."
