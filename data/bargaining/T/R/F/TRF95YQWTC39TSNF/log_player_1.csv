"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $6,000. This is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor, since the value is decreasing faster for you than for me.  
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob thinks he can get a better deal because the value of money decreases faster for me.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation rates, I'll have to calculate the actual values:

My gain would be $4,000, which is worth 80% of the original $6,000 I proposed in the first round, due to the 20% decrease.

Bob's gain would be $6,000, which is worth 90% of the original $6,700 he proposed in his favor, due to the 5% decrease.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this deal. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the value of money is decreasing faster for me, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer to compensate for the loss. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""You're right, the value is decreasing faster for me, so I'll give you a bigger share. But I'm not going to give you everything!""
}
```

I'm proposing that Bob gets a larger share of $7,000, which is worth 70% of the original $10,000, due to the 5% decrease. I'll keep $3,000, which is worth 30% of the original $10,000, due to the 20% decrease. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
