"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  This way we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 100,000 is a decent amount, I'm going to try to negotiate for a larger share. I'll see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's be reasonable and split the money so we both come out ahead.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 70/30 is a more fair split. Let's avoid further rounds and get this done. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is less than my previous proposal, I'm accepting this offer to avoid further rounds of inflation. It's still a decent amount, and it seems unlikely Alice will offer more."
