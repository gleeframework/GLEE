"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we have 12 rounds to divide the money and the value of the money will decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I don't want to risk losing out on any more money due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
