Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, but I still think I can get a better deal. How about 57-43? 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that the inflation is hitting me harder.  While I need to make a deal soon, accepting a deal where I get consistently less than 45% of the pot is a bad strategy.  I'm hoping she'll get more reasonable in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  We both lose if we go any further. 47-53 is fair, let's close this out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to apply some pressure and draw a line in the sand.  By presenting this as my ""final offer"" I'm hoping Alice will recognize the urgency and realize that continuing to push for a larger share might result in getting nothing.  This offer is still slightly in her favor, but acknowledges the time constraint and the impact of inflation on my share."
