"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous in the first round, but remember, the money is worth less with each passing round! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, the game's dynamics favor waiting.  The money will be worth less for Alice in the next round, giving me a stronger negotiating position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more fairly. The value of the money decreases faster for you than for me, so I'm offering you a good deal.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm not willing to take less than this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is now more appealing than waiting. The inflation rate is working against me, and there's a risk she'll reject my offer in the next round, leaving me with nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant sum."
