"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a significant share of the money, while still giving Bob a small amount. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared for him to counter-offer.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation means my potential gains are shrinking with each round. Accepting this 50/50 split ensures I get at least half of the money, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
