Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sticking to my principles.  A fair deal is better than no deal.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut my losses.  Bob is being incredibly stubborn, and the value of the deal for him is decreasing rapidly.  While I'd prefer a more favorable split, taking Bob's offer now guarantees me a reasonable amount of money. If I reject this offer, there's a real chance I'll end up with nothing, and the longer this drags on, the less appealing any potential deal becomes for me."
