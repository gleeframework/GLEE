I'm taking a very large share of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with a small amount to make him more likely to accept the offer in the first round. I want to avoid the inflation risk as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation rate makes taking a chance on getting a better deal risky.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation."
