"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the money quickly and avoid potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my previous offer, and even with inflation, it's not worth accepting. I'll reject this and see what Bob offers next."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is becoming increasingly greedy. His offer is significantly less than my last proposal, and even with inflation, it's not worth accepting. I'll reject this and see if he becomes more reasonable in the future."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to start taking inflation into account.  This offer is a further reduction from my previous one, but hopefully, it's enough to convince Bob to accept."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and even with inflation, it's not worth accepting. I'll reject this and keep pushing for a more balanced split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Inflation is starting to hit hard, and I'm getting desperate.  I'll offer a bit more to Bob, hoping to secure an agreement before things get worse."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being incredibly stubborn.  Even with the significant inflation hitting my share, his offer is unacceptable. I'll reject this and see if he'll budge in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Inflation is hurting me badly, but I need to try and salvage something.  A 50/50 split is the best I can do right now. It's a lot less than I initially wanted, but it's better than getting nothing."
