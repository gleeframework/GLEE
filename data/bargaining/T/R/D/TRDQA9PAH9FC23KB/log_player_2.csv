Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than half, but not this low. The longer the game goes on, the less we both get.  It's time to push for a more agreeable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  We're both losing money with each round. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out, and the pot is shrinking rapidly. I'm mirroring Alice's Round 1 offer but adding a sense of urgency. This is a risky move, but the game dynamics have changed significantly due to the inflation factor.  We both need to agree soon, or we'll both walk away with nothing."
