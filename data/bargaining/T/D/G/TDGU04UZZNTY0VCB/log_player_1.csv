"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 55-45 split is indeed more favorable to him, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is looking for a 55-45 split, I'll try to counter with a slightly more generous offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle! Let's try to find a fair split without going too far apart.""
}
```

This offer is a 50-50 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
