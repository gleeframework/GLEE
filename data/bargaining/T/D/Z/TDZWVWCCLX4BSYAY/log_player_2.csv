"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600, ""alice_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. This offer considers the time-value of the money.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her.  It made sense to reject and counter-propose. 
* **My offer:** I'm proposing a split that is more advantageous to me but still keeps in mind that Alice loses less value each round.
    * I'm aiming slightly higher than a 50/50 split to account for the fact that I'll lose more value if the game continues.
    * The message is framed to make it seem reasonable and fair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fair deal now 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of my larger inflation rate. While her offer is closer to a ""fair"" split considering the depreciation, it's still skewed in her favor. I need to push for a better deal in the next round, even if it means risking further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""This offer reflects a balance between fairness and the impact of inflation for both of us. Let's settle this now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  The money is losing value quickly. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
* **Balancing act:** This offer is slightly more aggressive than a simple 50/50 split, acknowledging my faster inflation rate. However, it's not so extreme that Alice would likely reject it outright. 
* **Urgency in the message:**  The message is designed to encourage Alice to accept by emphasizing the need for a quick resolution."
