Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given that you get a worse inflation rate. Let's get this done before the money loses too much value! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
