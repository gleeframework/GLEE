Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's start with a clean slate!""}

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, especially since my initial offer was already generous. I'm hoping to get a better deal. Let's keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share. How about we meet in the middle?""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation. Let's end this game and get our money. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that I rejected his initial 50-50 offer. A 60-40 split is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to end the game. Let's get our money and move on!"
