"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and the money I gained in the first round was $8000, the money I gain in the second round is 80% of $8000, which is $6400. 

I will accept the offer:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
