"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing an even split of $50 for each of us. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping we can agree to it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer an even split, the inflation makes accepting this offer the more logical choice.  I'll get less money, but it's still something, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
