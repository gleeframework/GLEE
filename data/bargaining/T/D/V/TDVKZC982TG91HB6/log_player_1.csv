Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very slightly unfair offer. This is to test Bob's greed and hopefully get him to accept in round 1, as the money will be worth less to me each round. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to get more money, I'm not sure I can get a better deal than this. Accepting means I get half the money now, which is worth more than waiting and potentially getting a slightly better deal but having the money be worth less."
