"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm framing it as a generous offer to see if Bob will accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, considering the initial offer was too generous 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in the new terms.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer. My initial expectation was for a more substantial gain, and I'm not willing to accept a lower amount, even considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the previous rejections, I'll make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the continued inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm not budging much. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, but still keeping a significant advantage for myself, given the ongoing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Given the continued erosion of value due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, and I'd rather lock in this deal than risk waiting for another offer that might be even worse."
