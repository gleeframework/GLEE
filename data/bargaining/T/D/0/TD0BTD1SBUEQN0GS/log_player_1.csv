"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100$ and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the 60$ I would gain is now worth 60 * 0.8 = 48$.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so now it's worth 80% of 80% of 100$, which is 64% of the original 100$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it roughly 50/50""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 48% of the original 100$ and Bob gets 52%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll take a smaller share if it means getting something 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the 40$ I would gain is now worth 40 * 0.5184 = 20.736$ (approximately), which is a significant decrease from the original 40$.

I'll accept this offer because it's a decent compromise and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns.
