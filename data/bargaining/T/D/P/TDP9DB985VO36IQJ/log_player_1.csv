"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money 3:1 in favor of you, Bob. I believe this is fair considering the decreasing value of money.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think 3:1 is still too generous. I'll give you 70, but I'll take 30. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
