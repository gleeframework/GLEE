"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 55/45 split.  We can always adjust if we need to. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since this is the first round, the money hasn't devalued yet, and we have 11 more rounds to negotiate. Accepting a 55/45 split right off the bat doesn't give us any room to potentially increase our share. Let's reject this offer and see if we can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Round 2
My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's try a 52/48 split. We both get a good share, and we can avoid further devaluation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also mindful of the devaluation.  Let's split it 54/46. This ensures we both get a reasonable share before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the money's value is decreasing, accepting a 54/46 split in the third round still seems premature. Given that we have 9 more rounds to negotiate and the fact that Alice is also losing value, albeit at a slower rate, we should continue to push for a better deal. Rejecting this offer allows us to potentially counter with a more favorable split in the next round, taking into account the ongoing devaluation for both parties."

My offer:
