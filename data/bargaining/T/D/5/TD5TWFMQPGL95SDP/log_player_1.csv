"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll get 60% of the current value of the money, which is 95% of the original $100, so I'll get $57. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll actually get $57. 

I'll accept the offer.
