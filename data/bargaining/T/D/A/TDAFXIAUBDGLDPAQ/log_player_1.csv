{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""}

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the reduced value of my potential gains due to inflation!

However, I'm willing to consider Bob's offer. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $300,000 when I was initially hoping for $400,000. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the massive reduction in the value of Bob's gains, I'm not thrilled about the offer. However, I'm willing to consider it. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $200,000 when I was initially hoping for $400,000. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the extreme inflation and tries to find a more balanced solution."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the extreme inflation, I'll make a new proposal that tries to find a more balanced solution:

I'm proposing that I receive $240,000 and Bob receives $760,000, trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the extreme reduction in the value of the money due to inflation."
