Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I figure with the inflation, I can take a big chunk and still be in a good position later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to stick with my strategy and try to get as much as I can before the inflation gets too bad!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to stick with my previous offer. While the money is worth less to me now, I don't think Bob is going to give me any more, especially since I just rejected his offer. I'm hoping he'll take it this time."
