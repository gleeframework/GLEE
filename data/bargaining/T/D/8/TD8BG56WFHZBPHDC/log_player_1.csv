"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start! Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still looking for a better deal. The 50-50 split I proposed initially was a fair one, and Bob's new offer is not as good as that.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to get closer to a 50-50 split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a relatively fair deal. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposal!

Considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm starting to feel like this offer is getting more reasonable. The 62-38 split is still a bit in Bob's favor, but it's not as bad as the 60-40 offer he made earlier.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
