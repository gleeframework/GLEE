"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he declines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 95/5 split. It's a fair compromise and ensures we both get something. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain has decreased by 10% due to inflation, making it even more tempting to accept a smaller share. However, Bob's offer is still quite one-sided, and I'm not eager to give up 95% of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I need to be more cautious with my proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a 42/58 split. I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need to make sure I get a decent amount to account for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a larger share. How about 90/10?  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain has decreased significantly due to inflation, making Bob's offer even more unappealing. I'm not willing to give up 90% of the remaining money, especially since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money I gain is worth even less now, so I need to be more aggressive with my proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 350000,
  ""bob_gain"": 650000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up 90% of the remaining money. Let's try a 35/65 split. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to make sure I get a decent amount to account for inflation.""
