Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll take a closer look at Bob's offer. Since the money I gain remains worth the same, and Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if I'm getting a better deal than in the previous round. However, I'll accept this offer since it's the same as the previous one and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
