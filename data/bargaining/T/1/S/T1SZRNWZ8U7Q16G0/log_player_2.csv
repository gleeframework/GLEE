"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 60/40. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation rate will affect me more than you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a tempting offer, but I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what she proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation disparity, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more reflective of our positions. This round offers you a chance to secure a larger sum than you'd receive in later rounds.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation is working against both of us.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a better offer than you'll get in later rounds, I assure you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is right about the inflation, but I'm not convinced this is the best I can get. I need to hold out for a bit longer and see if I can get closer to a 60/40 split in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my previous offer of 60/40. I know you're feeling the inflation pinch more, but this is a fair split considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's close this deal and avoid losing even more.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The value of the money is plummeting with every passing round. Let's be practical and split it 50/50. This is our best chance to get a fair share before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is right. This is getting ridiculous. While a 60/40 split was ideal, the longer we wait, the less we both get. A 50/50 split is now the most logical choice to ensure I receive a reasonable amount."
