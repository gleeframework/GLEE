60.0,40.0,I propose we split the money 60/40. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation rate will affect me more than you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I understand the inflation disparity, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more reflective of our positions. This round offers you a chance to secure a larger sum than you'd receive in later rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation is working against both of us.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a better offer than you'll get in later rounds, I assure you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, I'm sticking to my previous offer of 60/40. I know you're feeling the inflation pinch more, but this is a fair split considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's close this deal and avoid losing even more.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The value of the money is plummeting with every passing round. Let's be practical and split it 50/50. This is our best chance to get a fair share before inflation eats away at it further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
