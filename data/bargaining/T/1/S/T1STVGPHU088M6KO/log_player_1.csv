"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small portion of the money, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this quickly and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair proposal. However, considering the inflation factor, I'd rather get a slightly larger share now, even if it's not exactly 50/50. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're right, a 50/50 split is fair, but I'll take a bit more now to account for inflation. Consider this compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself, but still a reasonable compromise considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept a 45/55 split to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 45/55 split, which is closer to my desired share, but still not quite there. Considering the inflation factor, I'd rather get a slightly larger share now. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better deal.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Let's meet closer to 60/40!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise considering the inflation factor."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 58/42 split, which is closer to my desired share, but I was hoping for a bit more. However, considering the inflation factor, this offer is relatively good, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially losing more value. I'll accept this offer.
