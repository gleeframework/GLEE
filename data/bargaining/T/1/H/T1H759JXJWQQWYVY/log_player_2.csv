I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a lot of money, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. There's a lot of time left in the game, and I can try to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I'm proposing an even split of $500,000 each. This seems like the fairest and most likely way to ensure both of us get a good amount of money."
