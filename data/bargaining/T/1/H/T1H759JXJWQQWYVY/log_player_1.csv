I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor.  Bob gets a tiny amount, but I'm hoping he'll take it since it's better than nothing, and we're still in the early rounds with minimal inflation.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair split and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer.  The inflation is starting to kick in, so I'll take what I can get."
