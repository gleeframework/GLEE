  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a larger share, but I'm not sure if I should accept.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation is affecting my share more severely. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting my share more, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to take a larger share. Considering the inflation is affecting my share even more severely, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, I'm not willing to give Bob an even larger share. I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, especially since the inflation is eating away at my potential earnings. I'll try to make another offer, hoping to get a better deal."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a strong move. With the inflation affecting my share so severely, I'm not sure if I can afford to be too picky. However, accepting a 10/90 split is not ideal. I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, even if it means risking further inflation. I'll try to make another offer, hoping to get a better deal."
