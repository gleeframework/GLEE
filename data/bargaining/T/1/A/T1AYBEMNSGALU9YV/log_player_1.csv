"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can start fresh with a new game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want a bit more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him, but I don't want to risk waiting too long.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2. I'll aim for a slightly more balanced offer.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's get this division done!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite! My share is worth significantly less now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. While it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth even less than in the previous round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the reduced value.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's time to split it down the middle, Bob! No more negotiations!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split to try to force Bob to accept a more balanced deal."
