"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can take 20%. Let's see if we can do better than this in the next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 60-40 split is still a bit too skewed in his favor, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 60-40 split. Can you meet me in the middle at 55-45?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob is willing to adjust his offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40% less now due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot!""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust the split to 55-45, but I'm open to further negotiations!"
