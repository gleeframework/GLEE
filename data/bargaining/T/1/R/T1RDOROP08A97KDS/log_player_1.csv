"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given that the money is worth less for me in each round.  Let's work together and not let the value erode away. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
