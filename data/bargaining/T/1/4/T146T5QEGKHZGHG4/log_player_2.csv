I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it's a relatively fair split now, considering the inflation, the money will be worth significantly less in the future.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we should both get a good deal while the money still holds value.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor this round, and we can work out a fairer split in the future if you want to continue playing.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was quite generous. This is a slightly better deal for me, but still reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, the inflation is really biting now.  Alice's offer is more generous than my last one, and I don't want to risk the money becoming even less valuable.  I'll accept."
