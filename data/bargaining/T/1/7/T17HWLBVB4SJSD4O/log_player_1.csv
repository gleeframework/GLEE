"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. This is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more even split.  Let's work together to maximize our gains before inflation hits too hard. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $405,000, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $522,500.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
