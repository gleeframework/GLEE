"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""My offer is more in my favor this time, reflecting the impact of inflation on my potential gains. Let's secure a deal now before the money devalues further.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  It's crucial to acknowledge the inflation rate. Every round that passes significantly eats into Bob's potential earnings (20% decrease) compared to Alice's (10% decrease).
* **Shifting Leverage:** By round 2, the negotiating power shifts slightly towards Bob. Alice's initial offer of a 60/40 split in her favor becomes less appealing as the value of the money decreases faster for Bob.
* **Strategic Offer:** The offer of $5600 for Bob and $4400 for Alice gives Bob a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement before the value of the money diminishes further. This encourages Alice to accept rather than risk a lower offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing rapidly, let's settle this now. This offer considers the inflation impact on both our ends. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:** The inflation has taken a substantial bite out of the potential gains. Accepting $4400 now is significantly better than risking even less in further rounds.
* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice's offer, while still favoring her slightly, acknowledges the inflation impact. It's unlikely she'll propose something significantly better in future rounds.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a worse outcome for Bob as the value of the money rapidly deteriorates. Taking a slightly less favorable deal now guarantees a reasonable sum."
