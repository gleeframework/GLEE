"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and inviting Bob to respond with his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting too high, Alice. I'll meet you halfway. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $300,000, which is still a significant amount. Considering the inflation, I'd rather not wait and take this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
