"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, take it or leave it!""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a generous offer considering the inflation that will occur in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair proposal from Bob! However, considering the inflation, my gain of $500,000 in this round is actually worth 90% of the initial $500,000, since it's 10% less than the first round's value.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value.
