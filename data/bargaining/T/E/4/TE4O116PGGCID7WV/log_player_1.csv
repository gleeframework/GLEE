I'm rejecting this offer, though it's close. Bob is feeling the time pressure more than me because of the inflation heavily affecting his potential gains.  I'll continue pushing for a slight advantage."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{

This is a tough one, but I'll accept. Bob is right, we're down to the wire. While I'd prefer a slight advantage,  the inflation means his offer is actually pretty close to even in real value.  It's too risky to push further and risk getting nothing."
