I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to secure a good deal before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject the offer. While it's better than the previous round, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm not sure how the inflation is affecting Bob, but I'm willing to wait and see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 2000.  The inflation has likely made him more desperate for a deal, and I'm betting he'll accept this offer to get something before the money loses more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer more, the inflation is clearly starting to bite Bob harder than me.  I'm not sure how much longer he can hold out, and I don't want to risk losing out on a decent share."
