"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and even. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses value for me with each passing round, I have an incentive to end the game as quickly as possible. However, accepting an even split immediately might not be the best strategy, as Alice might be willing to give me a larger share to avoid further rounds where the money's value decreases for me but not for her. By rejecting, I aim to negotiate for a better offer in the next round, leveraging the asymmetry in how the value of money changes for us over time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince I rejected Alice's offer in the first round, it's now my turn to propose a division. Given the 10% decrease in value for me with each passing round, I want to propose a division that acknowledges this asymmetry but still appears reasonable enough for Alice to consider, in the hopes of ending the game sooner rather than later. I will propose that I receive 60 dollars and Alice receive 40 dollars, arguing that the decreasing value of money for me warrants a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss over time.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the value decrease for me, how about this split?""}"
