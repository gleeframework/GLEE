"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is 50/50, which is a fair split, but I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This way, I'm aiming for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decreased value of money due to inflation."
