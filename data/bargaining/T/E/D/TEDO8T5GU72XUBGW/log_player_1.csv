"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less after the second round of inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to give me a slightly larger share this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going all the way! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation rate, the money is decreasing in value much faster. I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer because I still think I can do better. The fact that Bob is giving me a ""slight edge"" but still taking a larger share doesn't convince me that this is the best deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less after the fourth round of inflation, I'll have to be even more careful with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. It's the fairest way.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split this time, hoping that Bob will see the value in a fair and equal distribution of the remaining money."
