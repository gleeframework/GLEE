"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $3,200. Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth... who knows how much for him, but it's still $6,000 for me.

I'll think about it... I don't want to give up too much, but I also don't want to risk waiting for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time.

Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $3,500 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is approximately $1,792. Since I don't know the inflation rate for Bob, I'll have to make a decision based on my own gain.

I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but I don't want to risk waiting for another offer. I'll take it.
