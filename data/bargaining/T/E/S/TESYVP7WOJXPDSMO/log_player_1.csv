"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is 30% of the original $100. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to more interesting negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair start, and avoids further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I'm not as excited about the even split as I was initially. Since my gain would be 50 * 0.8 = 40 (due to 20% inflation), I'd rather negotiate further. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected the even split, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. I'll aim to get a higher share, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob. I'm willing to take a bit more.""
}
```"
