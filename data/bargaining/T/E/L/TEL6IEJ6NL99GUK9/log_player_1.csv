"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we have to account for.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite fair, Bob. I think you're getting a better deal than me, considering the inflation. I'll pass on this offer.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55-45 split, especially since the money is worth less for me than it was in the first round. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my offer will be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This split should be more reasonable.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split in Bob's favor, with me getting $4,800 and Bob getting $5,200."
