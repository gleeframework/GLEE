"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose taking 90 dollars for myself and giving Bob 10 dollars. This leaves a significant portion for me, while still offering Bob a small share. I believe this is a fair initial offer, given the inflation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic choice. The inflation drastically reduces the value of any future rounds for me, and this offer still provides me with a significant amount of money, given the circumstances."
