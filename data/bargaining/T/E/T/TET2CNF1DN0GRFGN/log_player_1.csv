"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $4,500 and I'll take $5,500. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's a fair starting point, and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer. Since I already offered him $4,500 in the first round and he rejected it, I don't want to accept an offer that's lower than what I initially proposed, considering the 10% decrease in value due to inflation. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair adjustment""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $4,200 and I'll take $5,800. Since the value of money has decreased by 10% due to inflation, I've adjusted my proposal to reflect this change. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to reach a compromise. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but let's aim for a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer. Although he's offering me a slightly larger share, $4,500 is still lower than what I initially proposed, and the value of money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'll make another proposal in the next round, considering the current value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Inflation is rising, let's settle this""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $4,000 and I'll take $6,000. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I'm willing to take a larger share to compensate for the loss. This is a reasonable offer, and I hope Bob will accept it to avoid further devaluation."
