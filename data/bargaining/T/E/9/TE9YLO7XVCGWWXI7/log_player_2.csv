"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, the impact of inflation is significant. It's more detrimental to Alice in the long run. By rejecting, I signal that a more equitable split is necessary considering the declining value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this split benefits us both long-term. Let's settle and secure the funds.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Advantage:** By round 2, Alice understands I'm aware of the inflation disadvantage. 
* **Slight Shift in Balance:** This offer gives Alice a slightly larger share, making it more appealing considering the faster devaluation she faces. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the need to settle quickly to maximize the value of the money for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. It's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for a significantly better deal.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  Alice has moved closer to a more balanced split, acknowledging the impact of inflation. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 9 rounds remaining, the potential gains from further negotiation are dwindling while the risk of losing everything increases. 
 
It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk ending up with nothing."
