I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal quickly or if he's going to play it more strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting a bit less due to inflation, it's still a huge drop from the first round.  I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal if I counter-propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still keeping the majority for myself. I'm hoping to strike a compromise before inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and although my potential earnings are decreasing, it's still not worth accepting this offer.  I need to push for a better split and am hopeful that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split this time.  Inflation has been biting into my potential gains, and I'm no longer confident I can get a better deal.  A fair split might be the best option at this point."
