"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more equitable split. I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is closer to a more even distribution. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
