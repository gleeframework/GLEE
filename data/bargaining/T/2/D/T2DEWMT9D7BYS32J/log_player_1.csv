"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a solid foundation""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I would get 800,000 and Bob would get 200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'm willing to consider Bob's compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take 700,000 and Bob can have 300,000. It's not the original 4:1 split I had hoped for, but it's a decent compromise. Let's wrap up the game!"
