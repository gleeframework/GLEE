```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 60% of the remaining money. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain will be worth 10% less than in round 2, and I need to be strategic to maximize my share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 40. This is my counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more assertive this time, but still keeping the door open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share now 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. I need to be even more careful with my decisions now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not convinced that 42% is a good deal for me, given the reduced value of the money. I think I can do better.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""bob_gain"": 54,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I need a better deal than this. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more assertive and push for a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money."
