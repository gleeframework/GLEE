"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario where the best strategy is to be slightly greedy but also fair enough to ensure the other player doesn't reject the offer. I'm offering 9000 for myself and 1000 for Bob, hoping that the potential for future gain will be enough for him to accept the offer."
