Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is acknowledging the impact of inflation, her offer is still not favorable. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. It's time to push for a more balanced deal, even if it means risking another round."
