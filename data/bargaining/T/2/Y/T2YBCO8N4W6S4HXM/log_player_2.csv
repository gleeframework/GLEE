Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be practical. Time is money, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This offer gives you a fair share while considering the time factor.""}

# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we both want a good deal. This offer is a compromise, considering the time pressure and the fact that the value decreases for you more than for me. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
