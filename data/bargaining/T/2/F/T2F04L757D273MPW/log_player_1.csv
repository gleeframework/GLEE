"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $40, and I'll take $60.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a bit more fair, considering the upcoming inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on the money!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'll be getting $45, which is worth 5% less than the $60 I proposed earlier, and Bob will be getting $55, which is worth 20% less than the $40 he proposed earlier, I'll have to think carefully about it.

I'll reject this offer for now.
