"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, so I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. My gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I'll have to take that into account.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the 'generous' offer, but I'm not satisfied. I'll wait for a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 54,
  ""bob_gain"": 46,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take 46 and let's move on!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm still not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really biting now!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully about the reduced value of the money. My gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'll have to take that into account.

However, Bob's offer is still a bit too low for my taste. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're still being a bit stingy, Bob. I want a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money now.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve more. Take 20 and let's end this!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you most of it if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully about the reduced value of the money. My gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, so I'll have to take that into account.

However, Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. I'll accept the offer and take the 90. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the 90. It's better than nothing!""
}
```"
