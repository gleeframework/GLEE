9000.0,1000.0,"I propose we split it 90/10. This is a good starting point, and we can adjust as we go along. What do you think?",Alice,1,

7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle at 70/30. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation.",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"We're both losing a lot of value, and it's getting critical. I think 48/52 is a fair split, considering the circumstances. Let's end this before it's too late.",Bob,6,

6000.0,4000.0,"It's getting risky, but I'm willing to go down to 60/40. We need to reach an agreement soon or we'll both lose a lot more. Let's be reasonable and finish this.",Alice,7,
