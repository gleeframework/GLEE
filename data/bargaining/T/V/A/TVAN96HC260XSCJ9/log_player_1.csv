"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I'm hoping to get more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get a bigger share from the start.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is worth $190,000 in real terms, while Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth $640,000.

I'm not sure if I want to give up such a large share, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still keeping a significant portion for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small consolation prize, but I'm hoping to get most of the money. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze as much as possible from me.

Let's calculate the real value of the offer, considering the inflation:

My gain of $100,000 is worth $85,600 in real terms, while Bob's gain of $900,000 is worth $462,000.

I'm not thrilled about giving up such a large share, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint. I need to think carefully about whether to accept this offer or risk going to the next round.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob an even larger share, but I'm still keeping a significant portion for myself. I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a good deal and protecting my own interests. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny share, but I'm hoping to get most of the money and make up for the losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get an even larger share.

Let's calculate the real value of the offer:

My gain of $50,000 is worth $38,400 in real terms, while Bob's gain of $950,000 is worth $311,750.

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint, and the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. However, I'm not willing to give up my entire share just yet.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I'm willing to give you a very large share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. This is my final offer. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm giving Bob an extremely large share, but I'm trying to hold on to some value for myself. This is my last attempt to negotiate a fair deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be left with very little in the end."
