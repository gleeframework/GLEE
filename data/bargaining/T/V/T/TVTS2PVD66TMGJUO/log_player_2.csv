"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to have a fair share while considering the potential impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's worth taking a gamble and seeing if Alice will offer a better deal in the next round, especially since the money is likely worth less in the next round for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's still a fair share for both of us, and I believe it's a better deal than the previous offer considering the potential for inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division of the $10000 to ensure fairness and prevent any potential regret due to inflation. This way, both of us can avoid the risk associated with uncertain future values. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money.  Given the uncertainty of inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we continue, it's the safest option."
