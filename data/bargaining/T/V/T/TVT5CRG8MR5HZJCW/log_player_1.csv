"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly unfair proposal, giving myself a larger share. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer.  While Bob's offer is significantly better for me than my initial offer, I still believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm hoping that as inflation continues to impact the value of Bob's gains, he'll be more willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 60% of the money, hoping to reach a compromise. I'm aware that inflation is affecting Bob more than me, so I'm trying to be more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse for me due to inflation, but I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better deal.  I'm going to continue to reject his offers and see if he becomes more willing to negotiate.  There are still many rounds left, and I believe I can get a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm raising my offer again, but not by much. I'm trying to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also standing my ground.  I'm confident that with each passing round, inflation will continue to hurt Bob's side of the deal, making him more inclined to accept something closer to my terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still getting worse due to inflation, and while it's tempting to accept, I'm determined to see if I can push for a better deal. I'm sticking to my strategy of rejecting his offers and waiting for the inflation to work in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

With each passing round, inflation is making Bob's offers less appealing.  I'm raising my offer slightly again, hoping that the combination of my increasing offer and the decreasing value of Bob's gains will make him more likely to accept.  We're getting close to the end of the game, and I'm confident that I can secure a good outcome for myself."
