"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's try a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 40-60 split in his favor, which is a more even split than my initial offer. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split. It's his turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to round 2. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Your turn again!""
}

I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a bit more in my favor than the 50-50 split that Bob proposed in round 2. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
