I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on, before inflation takes a bite out of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to compromise, I still need to secure a good portion of the money.  This is a better split than Bob's offer in the previous round, and hopefully, it will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hit hard.  Accepting this offer means I'll still get a decent amount, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
