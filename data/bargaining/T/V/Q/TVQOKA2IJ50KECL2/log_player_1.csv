"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, so I'll give you 20. It's my turn now! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""20 is too low, I want a higher share""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm offering a 40-60 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split, but still slightly biased towards Bob's original offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a small share. Your turn to meet me next time! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is really trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""10 is too low, I want a bigger share""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I need something""
}
```

I'm offering a 25-75 split, which is a significant concession, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
