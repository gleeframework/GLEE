Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure since I'm the one initiating, I deserve a larger share. However, I'm still offering Bob a decent amount to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

This time I'm proposing a more even split, recognizing that the value of the money is declining.  I'm still aiming for a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid further losses due to inflation."
