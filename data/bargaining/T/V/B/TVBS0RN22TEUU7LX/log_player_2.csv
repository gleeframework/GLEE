Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value of money, I propose we divide the $100 in a 6:4 ratio. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for the inflation.
