"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, considering we have 11 more rounds to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since I'm getting $100,000, which is 10% of the original $1,000,000, I'll think carefully about this offer.

I decide to accept this offer.
