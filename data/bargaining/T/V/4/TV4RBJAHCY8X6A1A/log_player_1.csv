"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep 900,000 and give Bob 100,000. This feels like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'll offer 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob. It's less than my original offer but still a reasonable split, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is worse than my original proposal, the inflation has made the money worth significantly less. It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing."
