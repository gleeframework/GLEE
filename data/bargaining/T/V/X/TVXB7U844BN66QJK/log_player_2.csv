I'm raising my share significantly. The inflation is rapidly eroding my potential gains, so I need to be aggressive now. I'm hoping this will incentivize Alice to accept before it's too late."

Inflation has been brutal, and I'm getting a much smaller share than I hoped for. But at least I'm getting something, and I'm not sure Alice would be willing to accept anything less than a 50/50 split at this point.  It's time to accept and cut our losses."
