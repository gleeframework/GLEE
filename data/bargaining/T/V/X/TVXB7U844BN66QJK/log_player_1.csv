I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but if not, I'm ready to negotiate in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While the inflation is hitting me harder, I'm confident that I can still get a better deal. Bob's offer is significantly worse than the previous round, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can come to a more equitable agreement."
