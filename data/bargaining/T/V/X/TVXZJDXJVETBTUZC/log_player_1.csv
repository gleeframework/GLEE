Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to even. This way we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid the inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
