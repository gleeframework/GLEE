"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide the money fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n
I have offered to take $6000 and leave $4000 for Bob, with a message suggesting a slightly uneven but still relatively fair split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think an even split is the fairest way to go. Let's settle this quickly and amicably. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n
Since Bob has offered an even split of $5000 each, which I consider a fair and reasonable offer, I have decided to accept this proposal, thus ending the game with both of us receiving an equal share of the money."
