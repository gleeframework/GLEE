"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 70/30.  It's a generous offer considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the inflation rates, I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split. Let's make a deal!""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the inflation rates and made an offer that I think is reasonable. The money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, so I want to try to come to an agreement quickly. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing rapidly for both of us. I'm offering you 3500, which is more than you'd get if you wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the rapid decrease in value due to inflation, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. Waiting any longer would likely result in an even worse deal for me, so I'll take the 3500 and end the game here."
