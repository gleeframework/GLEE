Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split?  It's still in your favor, but closer to a fair deal considering the inflation.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time, Bob. It's fair given the inflation, and we can move on to securing something for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
