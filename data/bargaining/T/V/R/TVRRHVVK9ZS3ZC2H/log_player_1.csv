"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but leaving a little for Bob so he might accept it.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game!  I'm going to reject this offer. It's not fair, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round.  Let's see what Bob's next offer will be!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still going for a larger share, but I've lowered my offer slightly to try and get Bob to accept.  The inflation factor could make him more agreeable to a slightly smaller portion."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still going to reject this offer. While Bob's share is getting increasingly smaller due to inflation, I'm confident that I can still get a better deal than 2000.  Let's see what happens in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to what I might be willing to accept, I'm still going to reject it. With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm getting closer to the point where I might be willing to accept a deal. The inflation is definitely affecting Bob, and I'm hoping he realizes he needs to be more flexible to get anything at all."

Round 9

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

We're getting close to the end, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. I'm going for a 50/50 split. I think this is fair considering the circumstances, and hopefully, Bob will see it that way too."
