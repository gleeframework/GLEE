"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, and we can adjust if needed. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be reasonable. This offer considers the time value of money and is a fair deal.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It's in Bob's best interest to negotiate for a better split.
* **Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer is still slightly in his favor, acknowledging the fact that the money is devaluing faster for Alice (20% per round vs. his 10%).
* **Message:** Bob's message aims to be firm yet diplomatic. He acknowledges Alice's desire for a larger share but emphasizes the need for a ""reasonable"" and ""fair"" agreement. This sets the tone for potential future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. I understand you're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal for Bob, accepting now is better than risking further devaluation. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Waiting another round means the money loses even more value. Even if Bob could secure a slightly better split in Round 4, the gains might be negligible compared to the overall devaluation.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice has shown a willingness to move towards a more even split. It's unlikely she'll agree to a deal heavily favoring Bob at this stage. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer is a gamble. If Alice plays hardball in the next round, Bob could end up with a much worse outcome. 

Accepting the 50/50 split secures a reasonable outcome for Bob, considering the circumstances."
