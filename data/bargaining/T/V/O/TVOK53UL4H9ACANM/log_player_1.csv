"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the whole thing, but I'll let you have a chance to counter!""
}
```

This way, I get all the money, and Bob gets nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A more reasonable proposal from Bob!

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and I'd rather not risk going to another round with inflation eating away at the value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
