"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'm the one making the first offer 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair is fair - my turn to propose.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Sensitivity:**  Alice's offer was heavily skewed in her favor. By rejecting, I'm betting she'll be more willing to accept a less favorable deal in the next round due to the rapid devaluation of the money for her. 
* **Turning the Tables:** I'm mirroring her language (""Let's be fair"") and offering a similar but reversed split to highlight the time pressure she's under. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While my offer is also advantageous to me, it's not as extreme as hers. This leaves room for potential counter-offers in subsequent rounds if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Working in My Favor:** The rapid devaluation of the money for Alice is putting more pressure on her to reach a deal. While my potential gains are also decreasing, the rate is slower. 
* **Testing Her Resolve:**  Her offer is moving closer to an even split, suggesting my strategy of rejection is having an impact. By rejecting again, I signal I'm still aiming for a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice might become more desperate and offer even less in the next round. However, there's also a chance she'll concede to a more favorable split for me to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Time is running out Alice - this is my final offer.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:**  With each round, the stakes are rising, especially for Alice. My message aims to amplify that pressure by creating a sense of urgency and finality. 
* **Slight Concession (Strategic):** I'm slightly increasing my share to 65/35. This makes my offer more palatable than my previous 60/40, potentially enticing Alice to accept before the money devalues further.
* **Finality as a Tactic:** While I call it my ""final offer,"" I retain the option to accept a counter-offer from Alice if it's close enough to my desired outcome.  This tactic introduces a bluff element, hoping to secure a favorable agreement."
