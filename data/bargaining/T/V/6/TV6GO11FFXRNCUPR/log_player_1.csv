"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. This is a good middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed towards him, especially since the money is worth 20% less for him than it was in the first round. However, I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
