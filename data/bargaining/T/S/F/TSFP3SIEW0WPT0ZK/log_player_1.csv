"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'm hoping Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""Be reasonable, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more aggressive split, with me getting 56% of the $100 and Bob getting 44%. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a 50/50 split, which seems fair given the current state of the money's value. I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in future rounds, so I'll take this opportunity to settle for a tie."
