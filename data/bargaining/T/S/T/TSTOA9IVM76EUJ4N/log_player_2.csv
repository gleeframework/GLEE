"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I'll take $60, you take $40. A fair deal for both of us to end this quickly.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split things a bit more evenly. This offer still allows you to get a good deal before inflation eats into it too much more.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer. It's better than what you'll get if we drag this on further and the money keeps shrinking. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
