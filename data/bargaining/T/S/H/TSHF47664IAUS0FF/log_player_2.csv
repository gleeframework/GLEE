"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation you're immune to. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get the best deal possible!  I know that the value of the money is decreasing for Alice with each round, so I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I'm not willing to give you a majority.  Inflation is going to be a factor here, so let's work something out.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at the value.  Let's be practical and split this evenly.  50/50, it's the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  While Alice's offer is better than the last round, I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself.  Inflation is working in my favor, and I'm sure Alice will be willing to make concessions soon."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, the value of the money is decreasing for you, and you're going to lose even more if we go to another round.  Let's end this now.  I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need to keep a larger portion due to my immunity to inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  I understand the impact of inflation, and I'm willing to accept a slight disadvantage to close this deal.  This is a reasonable compromise, and if we don't agree now, the losses will only mount. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is very close to the initial offer, and the value of the money for Alice is decreasing significantly. It's likely that any further rounds would result in even lower value for her. Accepting this offer maximizes my gains while also achieving a reasonable resolution."
