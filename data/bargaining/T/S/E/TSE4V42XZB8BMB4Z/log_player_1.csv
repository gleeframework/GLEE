"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's be fair and split it 51/49 in my favor, as I'm taking a slight risk by rejecting your offer.  I'm confident we can both come out ahead. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
