Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is a good compromise, let's settle this now and avoid getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting progressively more aggressive with her offers as time runs out. This suggests she's feeling the pressure of the 12-round limit.  I'll hold out for a better offer closer to a 50/50 split."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We need to agree soon.  This offer is fair and avoids a disastrous outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, Alice's offers are getting closer to my earlier offer, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing significantly with each passing round. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting nothing at all if Alice becomes even more aggressive in the remaining rounds."
