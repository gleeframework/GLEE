"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to maximize my gain before the value decreases too much.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round where I'll make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll try to make an offer that benefits me a bit more. I'll offer Alice a bit less than half, hoping she'll accept before the value decreases further for me.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's still a bit unfair given the inflation. I'm willing to compromise, but I need at least 60 to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nGiven that the money is now worth 36% less for me than in the first round, accepting 40 would be significantly less valuable than the original 50 I was offered. I'll reject this offer and try to propose a better division in the next round, hoping to maximize my gain despite the increasing impact of inflation.\n\nPlease proceed to the next round where I'll make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nConsidering the money is now worth 36% less for me, I'll aim to get as close to the original 50 value as possible. Given the significant decrease in value for me, I'll propose a slightly more favorable offer to myself while still being somewhat fair to Alice, considering her perspective on fairness.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Given the substantial impact of inflation on my end, I believe this is a reasonable compromise.""}"
