"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I get a decent share, but still leave room for Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is now worth even less. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll decide to reject it. I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a larger share in hopes that he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continuous inflation, my share is getting smaller and smaller. However, Bob's offer is still a 45-55 split, which is a relatively close division. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping to at least get something out of the deal.
