Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to a lose-lose situation. I'm offering a compromise. Take it before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, Alice is clearly feeling the impact of inflation more acutely. I'm betting she'll become more willing to accept a less favorable deal in the coming rounds to avoid getting nothing at all."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this point. Let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball and appeal to Alice's sense of logic. A 50/50 split is the most straightforward and equitable solution, especially with the increasing pressure of inflation and dwindling time. This offer underscores the very real possibility of both players walking away with nothing if they can't agree."
