45.0,55.0,"I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the time pressure and the fact that you'll be getting the full value while mine will be reduced in the next round. Let's be reasonable and move forward.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and your share is only losing value. I'll come down to $65, your $35 is worth even less next round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 45/55. This way we both get a reasonable share, and we avoid further devaluation of my share. It's a win-win, let's end this game!",Bob,4,
