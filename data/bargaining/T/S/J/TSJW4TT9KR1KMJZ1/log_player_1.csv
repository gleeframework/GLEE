"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a small amount to get us started, and I'll get the majority of the money, but it's still a relatively fair split considering the game is just beginning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of 5000 in this round is actually worth 4500 in terms of purchasing power compared to the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
