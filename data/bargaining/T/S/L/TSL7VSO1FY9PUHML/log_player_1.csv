"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the revised offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and not giving away too much. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. The numbers are close enough, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting a worse deal."
