"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
Bob gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40

I'll accept this offer.
