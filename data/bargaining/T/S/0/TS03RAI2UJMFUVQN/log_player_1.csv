"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice a large majority of the money, but still offers Bob a small amount. This strategy is based on the idea that Bob might be willing to accept a small amount in the first round, hoping for a better deal later. It also takes into account the different inflation rates, giving Bob a slightly better deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is much more favorable to Bob, and while it's tempting to accept, it's important to remember that the inflation rate is working against Alice. Rejecting this offer gives Alice the opportunity to negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round, where the value of the money for Bob will have decreased further due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This offer is a compromise, giving Bob a higher share than the first round but still maintaining a significant portion for Alice. This approach aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob while also considering the decreasing value of the money for both players with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal, this offer gives Alice a significant sum and the money is rapidly decreasing in value. It's a better deal than what Alice has been offered so far, and the risk of getting nothing in the end is high. Accepting this offer is the safest choice considering the circumstances."
