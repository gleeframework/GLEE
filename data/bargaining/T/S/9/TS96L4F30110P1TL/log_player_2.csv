"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob.  I'll take the majority, but you still get a decent chunk.  Accept and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to take $1000, remember the inflation.  By rejecting, I can make a proposal in the next round and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I think a more equitable split is better for both of us. Let's aim for something closer to 40/60. This way, we both get a good share, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's meet in the middle.  This offer is fair and allows us both to get a decent share.  Accept and we can end this. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is offering a bit more than before, the inflation is really hurting. By rejecting, I can force another round and see if I can get a better deal. I might even be able to get her to accept my previous offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my previous offer. 40/60 is a fair split given the circumstances.  Let's end this here.  Another round of inflation will be detrimental for both of us.""
