"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and we can discuss and adjust from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, let's aim for a more equal split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with the money being worth even less due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
