"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial 100$ and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, my share of 70 is now worth less than 80 in the previous round. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the ongoing inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```

This time, I'm offering a smaller share to account for the additional 5% loss in value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the cumulative inflation effect, my share of 60 is worth significantly less than the initial 80 I proposed in round 1. Considering the ongoing inflation, I think this offer is a reasonable one. I'll accept it.
