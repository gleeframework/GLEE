"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer. If you reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round!""}\n\n###\n\nI made this offer because Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor, and I believe a more even split is fair. Given the inflation rates, it's in both our interests to come to an agreement sooner rather than later. This offer gives me a larger share than Alice initially proposed but still gives her a significant amount, considering the decreasing value of the money over rounds. The message aims to convey the urgency of reaching an agreement due to the impact of inflation."
