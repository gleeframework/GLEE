"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm looking for a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to improve! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $600,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $570,000 in real value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
