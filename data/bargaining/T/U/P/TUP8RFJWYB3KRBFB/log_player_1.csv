"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a generous share, but I'm not going to give you all the money. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, but I'm not going to give you all the money either. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new values, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice's gain: $700,000 * 0.95 = $665,000 (due to 5% inflation)
Bob's gain: $300,000 * 0.8 = $240,000 (due to 20% inflation)

I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more for my skills and efforts. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not impressed with your offer. I think I deserve more for my skills and efforts too. Let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

Alice's gain: $550,000 * 0.855 (1 - 0.145) = $469,250 (due to 14.26% inflation)
Bob's gain: $450,000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = $231,300 (due to 48.8% inflation)

I'll think about it...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give you the lion's share, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. This offer is similar to Bob's offer from round 4, but I'm trying to make it more appealing by framing it as meeting in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to play games anymore. I think we should split it 50/50. It's only fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more serious!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

Alice's gain: $500,000 * 0.777 (1 - 0.223) = $388,500 (due to 22.62% inflation)
Bob's gain: $500,000 * 0.326 (1 - 0.674) = $163,000 (due to 67.23% inflation)
