"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm proposing that I take $6000 and Bob takes $4000, with the message ""Let's be fair"". This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and it's a relatively even split. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This is a better deal for you than waiting longer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth less to me in this round, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Additionally, accepting this offer would mean I get $4500, which is less than what I initially offered to take ($6000). I'm willing to take the risk of waiting another round to try to get a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise""}\n\nIn this round, I'm proposing that I take $5500 and Bob takes $4500, with the message ""I'm willing to compromise"". Since the money is worth 20% less to me than in the first round, I'm trying to find a middle ground that would be acceptable to both of us. By compromising on the amount, I'm hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
