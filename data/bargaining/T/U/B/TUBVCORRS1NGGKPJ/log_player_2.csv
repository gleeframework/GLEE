"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll get a chance to propose next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to try and get a better deal. Even though the offer is fair in the sense of being a simple split and giving me a chance to propose next, it's still only 10% of the money. I'll try to get a better deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. I'm not sure how inflation will affect us, so it's best to be fair from the start.""}
