"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you can have the rest. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal where I get only 10% of the money. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  It's more fair than your last offer, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. How about a 55/45 split?  This gives you a better deal than the last round, and it's still a good outcome for me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, a 55/45 split is a significant improvement over the last round. Accepting this offer gives me a better share, and  it's still a decent outcome for Alice. It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
