I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives Bob a decent share while ensuring I get a larger portion of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is worse for me than the previous round, even with the inflation taken into account. I'll reject and make my own counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to try to compromise a bit by offering a 55/45 split in my favor. Even with the inflation, this is still better for me than Bob's previous offer. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him and we can end the game!"
