"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nHow's that? I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Let me know what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split. This way, we both get a good amount and can move on. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll make a counteroffer and try to get more money. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's settle this!""} 

I'm taking into account the inflation that has affected the value of the money for both of us. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'm adjusting my offer accordingly. I think this new split is more reasonable, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. Let me know what he thinks!"
