"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. Since the money's value decreases by 10% for me with each round, I want to start with a higher offer to account for the potential loss in future rounds. I'm framing this as a ""fair"" offer to appeal to Bob's sense of reasonableness, hoping he'll accept and we can conclude the game quickly.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's try 55/45 this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less to me now, Bob's offer of $45 for me is actually equivalent to $40.50 in the previous round. Given that I initially offered Bob $40 and he rejected it, I don't feel that accepting $40.50 (in original value) is a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round, hoping to get a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the decreasing value of money for me, I'll try to find a middle ground that's still favorable. I'll offer $57 for myself and $43 for Bob, which is closer to the even split Bob suggested but still accounts for my loss due to inflation. My message will emphasize the need for compromise.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We're both losing value with each round, so this is the best way to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less to me than in the first round, Bob's offer of an even split at $50 for each of us means I'm actually getting significantly less value than I initially would have. However, Bob's point about both of us losing value with each round isn't entirely accurate since he isn't affected by inflation. Despite this, considering the decreasing value and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, accepting this offer might be the best option to ensure I get something. It's a tough decision, but I'll choose to accept this offer to secure a gain, albeit a reduced one due to inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
