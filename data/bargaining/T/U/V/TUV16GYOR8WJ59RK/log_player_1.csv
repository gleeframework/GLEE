"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money with a 7:3 ratio. This should give us both a fair share while maximizing our gains.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60:40 is a more reasonable split, considering the risks and uncertainties of the game. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
