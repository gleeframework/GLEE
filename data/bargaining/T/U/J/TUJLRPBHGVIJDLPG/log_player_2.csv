"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly, with a slight advantage for me to start. This way we both benefit from ending the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to be a bit more aggressive in my proposal, while still being somewhat reasonable, to see how Alice reacts.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's speed this up; we're both losing to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money. Let's stop wasting time with negotiations and split it evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is losing value due to inflation and we've already reached a point where Alice is willing to offer a 50/50 split, I think it's wise to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIt seems like a fair deal, especially considering the impact of inflation. I'm happy to end the game here and walk away with $5,000."
