Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still advantageous for me to hold out a little longer. The impact of inflation is becoming more significant with each round, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 460000,
""alice_gain"": 540000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money in this game!  I'm bumping my offer up again to show I'm serious about a fair deal. Let's settle this now and both come out ahead.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm keeping it below her last offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a better outcome.  The message emphasizes the time pressure and frames the offer as mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's try this 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky one. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the accelerating inflation against me. While her offer is closer to her previous one, it's actually a worse deal for me than before. I need to hold my ground and signal I won't accept an offer that's moving in the wrong direction."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a deal where you get more than I do! Let's stop wasting time and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, but this time emphasizing that she's getting the larger share.  This makes it seem like I'm making a significant concession. The message aims for a more emotional appeal, highlighting the ""loss"" we both face if this drags on. It's a gamble, but the pressure of inflation demands a bold move."
