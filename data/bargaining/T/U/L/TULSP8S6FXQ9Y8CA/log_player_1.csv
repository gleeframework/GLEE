"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively equal split, but I'm trying to set a good tone for the negotiation."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. It's still not bad for me, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 is now worth $6,400. Bob's offer is a bit better, but I'm still not getting the best deal.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.
