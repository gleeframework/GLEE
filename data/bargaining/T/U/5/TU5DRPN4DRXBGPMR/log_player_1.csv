"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I get a decent amount now, and Bob gets a smaller amount that will still be worth more to him because it's worth 5% more to him than it is to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
