Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for you. My offer is still generous, considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear you're feeling the pressure, and frankly, so am I.  Let's end this now before we both lose out even more. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  The longer this goes on, the less I get, and Alice seems determined to hold out for a larger share. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, which is better than risking a worse outcome in a future round."
