"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still a 50-50 split, but with a slightly more favorable ratio for him due to the inflation. I'll have to consider this carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable ratio for myself this time, but still a relatively even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about Bob's offer. It's a 40-60 split, which is a significant deviation from the initial 50-50 ratio.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is making the money worth less and less. I'll have to be strategic about my next offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm going back to a 50-50 split, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
