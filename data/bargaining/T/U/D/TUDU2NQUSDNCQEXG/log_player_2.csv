**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I'm sticking to my guns. Accepting this offer means losing significantly more due to inflation, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  It's a risk, but the potential reward of a better split outweighs the steadily decreasing value of the money."
