Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant. It's worth risking another round to see if we can get a better deal."
