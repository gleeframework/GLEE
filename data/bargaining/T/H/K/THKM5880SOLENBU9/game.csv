600000.0,400000.0,"This offer is based on the principle of fairness. I propose we split the money in a 3:2 ratio, with me receiving 600,000$ and you receiving 400,000$. This maintains a reasonable balance considering the risk of inflation in future rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I'm willing to take a slightly higher risk of inflation to gain more money. I propose a 7:3 split, with me receiving 700,000$ and you receiving 300,000$. This way, I'll have a larger buffer to absorb potential losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but given the inflation risk, I believe it's important to maintain equal shares. Therefore, I propose a 50/50 split, with both of us receiving $500,000. This ensures a fair distribution and reduces the impact of potential future inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to compromise on the split, but I still want to account for the inflation risk. I propose a 55:45 split, with me receiving 550,000$ and you receiving 450,000$. This way, I'll still have a slight advantage while acknowledging the importance of fairness.",Bob,4,
