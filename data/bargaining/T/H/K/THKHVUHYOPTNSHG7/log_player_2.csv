"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, aren't you? I'll give you a decent amount, but you'll have to do better than this in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I've adjusted my proposal to 450,000 for me and 550,000 for you. This aims for a fair split while acknowledging the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
