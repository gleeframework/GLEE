"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the new offer. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial proposal.""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I don't get left with too little in the end. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, and 55% of the remaining 100$ is a decent offer considering the reduced value of money. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation."
