"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start for me.

I'll think carefully... With inflation, the money is worth 5% less each round, so the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to think strategically to maximize my gain.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less in each of the two rounds), I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This way, I'll get 70% of the current value, which is still a decent share considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal.

Considering the inflation, the money is worth 14.26% less than the original $1,000,000, so I'll have to be cautious.

However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing out on a decent share. I'll accept this offer.
