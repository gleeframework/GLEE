"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to make it worth your while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively generous amount considering the initial total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, the numbers are:

* My gain would be 300,000 * 0.8 = 240,000 (20% less than the previous round)
* Bob's gain would be 700,000 * 0.95 = 665,000 (5% less than the previous round)

Considering the decrease in value, Bob's offer is still quite lopsided. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking effect, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a slightly more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll meet you halfway, but I'm still trying to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

* My gain would be 450,000 * 0.512 (1 - 0.488) = 230,400 (48.8% less than the initial value)
* Bob's gain would be 550,000 * 0.855 (1 - 0.145) = 469,250 (14.26% less than the initial value)

Considering the decrease in value, Bob's offer is still quite close to the previous offer, but I'll accept it since it's a slightly better deal for me.
