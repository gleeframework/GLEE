"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly skewed, split. I'm willing to give you 10% as a gesture of goodwill.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get a bigger share. Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair.  It's a good starting point for negotiations, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but 60/40 is a bit too much in your favor.  Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 55/45 is a good deal in the current round, I think I can still get a better deal in the future.  The game isn't over yet and I have time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  50/50 is the fairest split, and it gives us both a decent share of the money.  This is a win-win situation, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation.""}
