"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer isn't great, it's better than nothing.  With inflation, I'm losing money with every round, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the future."
