"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 4000""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less. I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is closer to my initial proposal, I'll consider it a reasonable compromise. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
