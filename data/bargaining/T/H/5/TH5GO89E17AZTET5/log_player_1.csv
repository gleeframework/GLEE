"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This ensures a comfortable head start, knowing that the money will depreciate faster for Bob than for me in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I propose a 600,000 to 400,000 split in my favor.  While the money is worth less than in the first round, Bob's offer was too unfavorable. This offer still gives me a significant share while offering a compromise to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The money is depreciating quickly, and with the next round being my turn to offer, I'm likely to get a worse deal. Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial sum."
