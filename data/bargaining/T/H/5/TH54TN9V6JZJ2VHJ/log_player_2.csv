"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer won't be as good for you in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round, maybe I can get a better deal despite the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before inflation takes its toll.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making an offer that slightly favors me, considering the 20% decrease in value for me and only 5% for Alice. I'm hoping Alice will see the benefit in settling now rather than risking further devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm offering you a fair deal before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems slightly better than the first round, considering the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a more favorable deal in the next round. The difference in inflation impact between us is significant, and I want to leverage that to get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation, I believe this offer is more than fair. Let's settle before it gets worse for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the accelerating devaluation of the money, especially for me, I'm trying to reach a middle ground that is slightly more favorable to me but still might be acceptable to Alice, who is less affected by the inflation. I'm emphasizing the mutual benefit of settling now to avoid further losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or you'll be left with crumbs in the next round! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the severe impact of inflation on my share, which is now worth 59.04% less than initially, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. The difference in inflation impact between us has put me at a significant disadvantage, and waiting for another round could result in an offer that is effectively worth very little to me. Alice's message also implies that the next offer might be significantly worse, so I'm choosing to secure what I can now."
