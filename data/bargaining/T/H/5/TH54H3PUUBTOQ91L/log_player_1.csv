"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60/40 split. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a bigger chunk, I'm the one making the proposal this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I now have to decide on a new proposal. Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think Bob's offer is very generous, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll let Bob make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500 and keeping $4,500 for myself, which is a 45/55 split. I'm framing it as a ""meet in the middle"" proposal to see if Bob will accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller cut this time, but I still want more! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I now have to decide on a new proposal. Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think Bob's offer is generous enough, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll let Bob make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""It's time to be equal, let's share it 50/50""

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money. I'm framing it as a ""50/50"" proposal to see if Bob will accept and end the game."
