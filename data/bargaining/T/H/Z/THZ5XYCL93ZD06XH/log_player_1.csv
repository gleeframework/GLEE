Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than an even split, hoping to secure his acceptance in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  With each round, my share will decrease further due to inflation. Accepting now ensures I get a decent amount."
