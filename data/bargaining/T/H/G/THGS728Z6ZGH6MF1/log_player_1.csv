"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'm not sure I want to meet Bob in the middle, considering the value of the money has decreased. I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a good deal, but I need more!""
}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split, hoping Bob will be willing to accept a smaller share. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too much! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

I'm not sure I'm willing to accept this offer, considering the value of the money has decreased significantly. I think I can do better than a 55/45 split. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is dropping fast!

  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve more!""

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

Considering the offer is now worth significantly less than it was initially, I'm not sure I want to accept a 40/60 split. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it!""

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has ravaged the value of the money, and I'm left with a tiny fraction of the original amount!
