"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the initial value of the money.""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, which seems reasonable to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise and meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 50:50 split. I was hoping for a slightly more favorable outcome, considering I was the one who made the initial offer. I'd like to propose again."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share.""}

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 52:48 split, but I'm also not eager to continue the negotiation. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I can do better. I'll propose again."
