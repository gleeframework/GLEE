"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself $900,000 and Bob $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate depending on how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob is proposing the same split, but in reverse! This is a tricky situation, as I lose 20% of the value of the money with each round. However, I'm not going to accept this deal just yet. I believe I can still get a better deal for myself by rejecting and continuing to negotiate. I want to see if he's willing to budge at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm proposing a 75/25 split, giving myself $750,000 and Bob $250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm trying to be reasonable given the inflation and Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still prioritize getting a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is mirroring my previous offer, and while I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, I'm not going to accept this just yet. It's clear he's not willing to budge, so I'll continue rejecting and see if he's willing to come down in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving myself $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a further reduction from my previous offer, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. Given the inflation and Bob's stubbornness, I need to start compromising to secure any deal at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is mirroring my offer again. While I am losing a large amount of value due to inflation, I refuse to accept this offer.  I need to continue negotiating to secure a better deal for myself.  I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a last-ditch effort to secure a deal before the inflation eats away at any potential profit. I'm willing to compromise significantly to avoid getting nothing at all."
