"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money in a 7:3 ratio. This allows us to share fairly while considering the decrease in value over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 3:2 ratio, a compromise between our initial offers. This way, we can both get a decent share of the money while considering the decreasing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
