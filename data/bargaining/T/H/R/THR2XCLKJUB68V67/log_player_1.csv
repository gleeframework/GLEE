This is a tough one, but it's time to accept.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point with only 6 rounds remaining. Bob knows the longer this goes, the more desperate I become.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if I hold out hope for a better deal, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains each round. 
* **Bob's 'Compromise':** This is cleverly disguised as a concession to inflation, but it's the same offer he made in Round 1.  He's likely to stick to this split.

Taking $4,000 now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we fail to agree."
