"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, giving me a large share but still offering Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While Bob has offered me more than in the previous round, it's still a significantly smaller share than I proposed. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
``` 

I propose Alice gets $750,000 and Bob gets $250,000. This is a compromise, offering Bob more than my initial proposal while still giving me a majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While Bob's offer is a significant increase from the previous round, it's still not a fair division considering the money we are losing due to inflation. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm offering $600,000 for me and $400,000 for Bob.  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not going to take a huge loss due to inflation. This offer gives Bob a substantial share, considering the money we've already lost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I understand Bob's strategy of slowly increasing his share, this offer is still too low considering the significant inflation we've experienced. I'm going to continue negotiating for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing an even split of $500,000 each.  We've both lost a significant amount of money due to inflation, and an even split seems the fairest option at this point to avoid further losses."
