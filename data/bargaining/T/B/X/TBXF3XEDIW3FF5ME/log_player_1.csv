"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 999,000 / 1,000 split.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in getting something, even if it's small, rather than risking getting nothing at all in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm not confident I can get a better deal in future rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least a quarter of the original amount, which is better than nothing."
