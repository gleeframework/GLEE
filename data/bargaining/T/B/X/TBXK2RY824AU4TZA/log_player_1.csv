"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 7:3 ratio. This offers a fair split considering the decreasing value of money over rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 4:6 split, which is closer to an even split than your 7:3 offer.  Let's start with a more balanced division. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
