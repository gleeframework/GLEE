Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a larger share. It's a risky strategy, but I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering me a significantly lower share than I proposed, and with the inflation factor, my gain is even less appealing. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time, taking into account Bob's counter-offer. I believe this is fair and will likely be more appealing to him than his previous proposal."
