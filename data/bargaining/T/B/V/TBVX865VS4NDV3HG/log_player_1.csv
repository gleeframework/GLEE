"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the 30, it's a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount and can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but we can both still get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure I want to give him the majority of the money just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, the money is worth less and less each round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit too greedy, Bob! Let's meet in the middle this time.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but still a decent one."
