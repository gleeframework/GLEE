Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've thought about it, and I'm willing to compromise, but I still deserve more.

# Alice gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases for me due to inflation. I need to secure a reasonable amount quickly.
* **Slight Concession:** I've lowered my asking amount slightly from Round 2 to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm holding firm to avoid being taken advantage of. 
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to add pressure on Alice to accept. If she rejects this, the potential gains in future rounds might not be worth the risk of further devaluation for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. This is my new proposal. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. She's sticking to her guns and even reducing my potential gain.  It's a gamble, but I'm hoping she'll fold in the next round, especially since I've been consistently rejecting her offers.  The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me, but accepting this low offer sets a bad precedent."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Enough games, Alice. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is steadily eroding my potential gains. Holding out for a significantly larger share is becoming riskier with every passing round. 
* **Implied Deadline:** While there's no official deadline, the rapidly increasing impact of inflation creates an implicit one.  
* **Fairness Appeal:** After rounds of back-and-forth, a 50/50 split emphasizes fairness.  It might be more appealing to Alice now that she sees I'm serious about not accepting a bad deal.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable share, even if it's less than what I could have gotten in earlier rounds. It avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if Alice continues to play hardball."
