"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is too much. How about 55/45 in my favor? This way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further rounds of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still not beneficial for me. The inflation is hitting me harder than her.  I need to push for a larger share now before the money loses too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm offering you 45% - take it or leave it. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value diminishes significantly for me. I need to apply pressure and make Alice realize that stalling is not in her best interest either.
* **Strong Stance:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to signal that I'm serious and won't be swayed easily in further negotiations. 
* **Slight Concession:** I've mirrored her previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise but not budge further."
