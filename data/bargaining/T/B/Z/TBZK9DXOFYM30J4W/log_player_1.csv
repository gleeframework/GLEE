"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but it's important to remember that Bob's money is worth less than mine with each passing round. I'm hoping this will motivate him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm getting less than in the first round, Bob's offer is still very unfavorable to me. His money is depreciating faster, so I think I can get a better deal if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share, but still keeping a decent portion of the money. With inflation, Bob is losing a lot of his buying power, so he might be tempted to accept this offer."
