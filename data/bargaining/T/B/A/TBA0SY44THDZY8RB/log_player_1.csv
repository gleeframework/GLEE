"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll have to be cautious. However, meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise.
