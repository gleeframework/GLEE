Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm starting with a big share for myself, hoping to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'm taking the 50/50 split.  Inflation is a real threat, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all!"
