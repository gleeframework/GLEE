I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering I am the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose an even split.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, and we are both facing inflation, a 50/50 split seems like the most fair option to maximize our gains."
