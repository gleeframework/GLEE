Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $450,000 and take $550,000 for myself.

I'll include a message to persuade Bob that this is a good deal, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us.\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal than before.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this and we both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer this time. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, especially for me (27.1% less), I think this offer is reasonable. Bob's message also suggests that he's getting impatient, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. Let's settle for this and walk away with something.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
