Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 2:1 ratio is more reasonable, considering the inflation factor. This way, we both get a decent share of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
