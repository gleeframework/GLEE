Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's meet in the middle. This way, we both get a significant share, and we can avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. We've both lost enough due to inflation. This is a fair offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you reject it. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, and the inflation is significantly impacting the value of his potential gains.  I'm willing to gamble that he'll offer a much larger share in the next round to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my last offer. Take it, or I walk away with nothing, and so do you!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob.  He's running out of time, and the value of his share is rapidly declining. By presenting this as my ""last offer,"" I'm hoping to make him see that accepting a smaller share now is better than risking a complete loss in the next round."
