"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 and keeping 700,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm really trying to get the upper hand by getting a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to 8:2, still a good starting point? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 200,000 is worth 90% of the original 700,000, which is $630,000. Bob's gain of 800,000 is worth 95% of the original 300,000, which is $285,000.

I don't like the fact that Bob is trying to take a larger share, especially considering the inflation effect. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take a more aggressive approach in Round 3. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You can't afford to be greedy, Bob. Take the 10% and be happy.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a mere 10% of the remaining amount, while keeping 90% for myself. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A compromise at 4:6, considering the inflation impact 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 600,000 is worth 72.9% of the original 700,000, which is $509,300. Bob's gain of 400,000 is worth 86.74% of the original 300,000, which is $260,322.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I think it's a good time to settle. I'll accept his offer.
