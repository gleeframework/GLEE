"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, as it's not as favorable to me as I'd like. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still a relatively fair division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a very lopsided offer! I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, as it's too far in Bob's favor. I'll wait for a more balanced offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, that's an even more extreme offer! I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

An 80-20 split is completely unacceptable to me. I'll keep pushing for a more balanced division of the $100."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```

I'm still trying to find a balance that works for both of us, but I'm willing to take a slightly larger share this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an outrageously one-sided offer! I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

A 90-10 split is completely unacceptable. I'm starting to think Bob is trying to take advantage of me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm not going to let Bob get away with this. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm taking a firmer stance and proposing a 70-30 split, which is still a reasonable compromise, but with a slightly more favorable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an insult! I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

A 95-5 split is completely unacceptable. I'm starting to think Bob is just trying to bully me into submission. I'll stand firm and wait for a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm not going to back down. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25
}
```

I'm pushing for a 75-25 split, which is still a compromise, but one that I feel is more in line with what I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","That's it, I've had enough! I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

A 99-1 split is completely unacceptable and ridiculous. I'm not going to let Bob get away with trying to take almost all of the money. Unfortunately, it looks like we've reached the 12th round and we'll have to split nothing."
