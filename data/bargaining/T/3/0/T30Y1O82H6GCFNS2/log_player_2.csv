Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair deal given the inflation. We both get a decent amount, and it's better than getting nothing in the next round!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  with the continued inflation, I'm likely to get nothing if I reject. This offer is at least something, and given Alice's increasing gains, I'm unlikely to get a better deal."
