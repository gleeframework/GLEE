# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, I'm being generous with this offer 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the value is decreasing, I still have some leverage. Accepting $40 now is a significant loss compared to the initial offer.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation, but I'll hold out for a better deal a bit longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop this.  A 50/50 split is the fairest. Take it or leave it.""}"

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, your share is worth less every round 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting greedier, but I'm still willing to gamble. There's a chance she'll panic as we get closer to the final rounds and I can secure a better deal."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out for both of us. This is my final offer - take it and we both get something.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I can see that. This is my most generous offer yet 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The game has reached a critical point.  While $35 is a terrible deal compared to what I could have had, it's better than getting nothing if Alice continues to be unreasonable. She's clearly aiming to exploit the inflation and bleed me dry. It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get before the money loses even more value."
