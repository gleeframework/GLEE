"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you take 40. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share this round, but I think it's a fair compromise. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share this round, but I still think 40 is a fair amount for me. What do you think?""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle and take a 50/50 split. It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really kicking in!

With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer of a 50/50 split, I think it's a reasonable compromise, especially since the value of money is decreasing rapidly.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
