Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45, considering the inflation you'll face in the next rounds 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant inflation impact on your gain, I think 60/40 is a reasonable split now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While the inflation is significant, accepting the offer will give me a better outcome than the likely scenario of getting nothing if I reject and continue the game."
