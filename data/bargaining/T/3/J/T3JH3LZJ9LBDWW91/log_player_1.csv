"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer aims to secure a large portion of the money while still offering Bob a small amount to incentivize acceptance in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer more of the money, the 5% inflation makes the offer more appealing than going to another round where I might get less than $4,750 (95% of $5000)."
