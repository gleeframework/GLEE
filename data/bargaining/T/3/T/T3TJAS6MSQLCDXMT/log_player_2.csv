Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be stubborn, Bob. This is a good deal considering the circumstances 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is becoming increasingly more acceptable as inflation eats away at the overall value.  At this point, it's better to secure a diminishing gain than risk getting even less in a future round."
