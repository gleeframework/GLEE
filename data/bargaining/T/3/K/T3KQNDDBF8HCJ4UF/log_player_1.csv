"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I propose to take $6,000 and Bob takes $4,000. This seems like a fair starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this is a better offer for Bob, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject this and see what he proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to propose a slight increase to my share, $5,500 for me, $4,500 for Bob. It's a fair compromise, and I hope he accepts it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not happy with this offer, I've already rejected two of his proposals, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal due to inflation. It's better to take what I can get at this point."
