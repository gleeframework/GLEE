I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, hoping to secure a good chunk of the money quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy, but I'm not going to accept such a small share. I'll counter with my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground. This offer is still more favorable for me, but it's more reasonable than my first attempt.  Let's see if Bob will budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair deal. It's time to stop pushing for a better share and just accept what's on the table.  I'm not confident that we'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
