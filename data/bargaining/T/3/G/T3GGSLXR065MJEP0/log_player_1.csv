"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is the reverse of mine from the first round, and it's a fair split, but I'd rather get a larger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even larger share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to split the money 50/50 now. I'm not sure if I want to give up my chance to get more, but it's a fair split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for an even larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to revert back to his original offer from round 1, but with a slightly different split. I'm not sure if I want to give up my chance to get more, but this is a more generous offer than the one I made in round 5.
