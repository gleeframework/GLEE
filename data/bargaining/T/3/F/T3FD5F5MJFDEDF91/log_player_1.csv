"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a good starting point, as the inflation is more significant for Bob, and I am taking the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 70/30, recognizing that Bob's offer was unfair. While I'm still hoping for a favorable outcome, I need to consider the diminishing value of the money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While the money is worth less, I'm confident I can get a better deal with my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

Given the rapid inflation and the fact that we're now halfway through the rounds, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This seems like a fair solution, considering the significantly reduced value of the money for both of us."
