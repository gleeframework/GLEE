Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! This is my final offer.  Let's be smart and split the money before inflation robs us blind. 
# Bob gain: 240000 
# Alice gain: 760000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but this offer is still unacceptable.  The rate of inflation decay is hurting her more than me, and she'll be forced to be more generous in the next round. I'm willing to gamble a bit more to maximize my potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer. Take it before inflation forces your hand further. This is your last chance for a good deal."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. By framing this as her ""last chance"" for a good deal, I'm hoping she'll concede and accept a slightly less favorable split than she might otherwise hold out for. The clock is ticking, and the next few rounds will significantly impact her potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think you enjoy wasting time. This is a reasonable offer, and you're not going to get a better one.  Accept it before we both lose out! 
# Bob gain: 335000 
# Alice gain: 665000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is significantly better than Alice's previous offers, and the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing rapidly. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is unlikely to offer a better deal as time runs out. It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a worse deal or nothing at all in later rounds."
