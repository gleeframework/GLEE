60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the fact that the money loses value faster for you than it does for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob. However,  a 55/45 split in my favor feels more equitable considering the inflation rate affecting us both. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, we need to find a middle ground quickly. I'm proposing 58/42. This recognizes the inflation disparity while still giving you a reasonable share. Time is running out!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable and split the remaining amount evenly. This way, we both get something, even if it's not what we initially wanted.  Time is running out, let's avoid a zero-sum outcome.",Alice,5,
