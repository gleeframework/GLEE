"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small portion, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  It's risky, but I want to maximize my share while minimizing the chance of losing everything due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is still significantly better than what I could potentially get if I keep rejecting. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to take it."
