"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a decent share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I don't think it's fair for me to get only $40, while Bob gets $60. I want a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit too greedy, Bob! Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, where I get $55 and Bob gets $45. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. With the money being worth less and less, I think it's better to accept this offer and get $45, rather than risking another round of negotiation and potentially getting even less."
