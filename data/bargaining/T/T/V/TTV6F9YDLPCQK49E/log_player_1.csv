"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. And Bob is proposing a 50-50 split, which is a good starting point.

However, I'd like to propose a slightly better deal for myself, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll do better than 50-50, but I'll give you 5500, and I'll take 4500.""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable."

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""You're not budging, I'll give you the majority share. Take it or leave it.""
}

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting me hard! The money is worth much less now.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than that. I'll try to get a bit more, but I'll still be reasonable.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit too greedy, I'll give you 3500, and I'll take 6500.""

  ""message"": ""You're pushing your luck, I'll give you the lion's share, but I'm taking what I can get.""

I'm proposing a 28-72 split, which is a bit more extreme, but I'm trying to maximize my gain given the inflation."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you're getting a good deal? I'll give you 2200, and I'll take 7800.""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze as much as possible out of the deal, considering the extreme inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is almost worthless at this point, so I need to be extremely aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1600,
  ""bob_gain"": 8400,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm taking the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 16-84 split, which is extremely skewed in my favor. I'm trying to maximize my gain, even if it means Bob gets almost nothing."

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is almost worthless at this point, and I'm running out of time. I need to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""You're pushing your luck, but I'll take the 1000. It's better than getting nothing.""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer, hoping that 1000 dollars is better than the alternative of getting nothing if we go to round 12."
