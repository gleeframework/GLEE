"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this over with quickly.  I'll take the lion's share, but you get a little something to keep you happy. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's worth exploring if there's a better deal to be had, even if it takes a few more rounds.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to take the majority, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  Let's be reasonable, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still trying to take the majority, and while the offer is a bit better than the first, it's still not fair.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic.  We both lose money with each passing round.  I'm willing to give you a good share, but we need to compromise if we want to get anything at all.""}
