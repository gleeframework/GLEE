"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'd like to hear Bob's thoughts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5,000
* Bob gain: $5,000

I'm not sure I want to give up half of the remaining money, but it's a more balanced split than the previous offer. I'll consider it. I'll accept this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
