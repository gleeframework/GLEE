"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and leaves $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the equal split, especially considering the reduced value of money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 1, due to the cumulative effect of inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, considering the reduced value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer, as it's a slightly better share than I got in round 3, and the value of the money is still decreasing."
