"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. This seems fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer seems fair on the surface, I'm aware of the inflation factor.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think it's time we split the money more evenly. Let's both take a little less, but I'm willing to take a bit more of the risk with the inflation. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is eating into your potential gains. My offer is still the best on the table if you want to walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not satisfied with the split, especially as the inflation is affecting me more. I'll try to make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a way to split this fairly given the inflation.  Let's both take 50% and call it a day. This way we both avoid further losses.  What do you think?""}
