Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55-45 split.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice with each passing round, I'm hoping she'll be motivated to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation. Let's see how she responds! \n\n###\n\nThe current offer is: \nBob gain: 5500 \nAlice gain: 4500 \nMessage: Let's try a 55-45 split.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting, we both lose money with every round! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Alice's offer this time. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I think it's wise to accept the 50-50 split rather than risking further devaluation. \n\n###\n\nLet me know the final result! \n\n###\n\n###\n\nassistant<|end_header_id|>"
