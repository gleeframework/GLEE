"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 30% 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $480,000. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer, considering I could have gotten $700,000 in the first round, which is now worth $560,000.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since the money is worth 80% of its original value, I'll aim for a higher percentage.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk and give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

This way, I get 85% of the current value of the money, which is equivalent to 68% of the original $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and take a 50/50 split, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, which is $512,000. Considering the previous offers and the current state of the game, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise.

I'll accept this offer.
