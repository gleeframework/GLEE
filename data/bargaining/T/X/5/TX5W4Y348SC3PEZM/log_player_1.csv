"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
