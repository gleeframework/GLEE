"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair deal, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
