I'm proposing a 5500/4500 split in my favor. I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent share while still giving me a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split this round. Since we both rejected the previous offers, I think it's time to compromise and split the money evenly."
