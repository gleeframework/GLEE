Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly lopsided, split. I'm confident we can find a more agreeable solution as we go along.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was quite harsh!  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It reflects that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a good deal for me considering I'm taking the risk of further devaluation.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, 60/40 is still too far off from what I consider fair. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, a more balanced approach that reflects our equal contribution to the negotiation. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is inching closer, but it's still early, and she's clearly aiming for the lion's share.  I need to push for a more significant shift in my favor before the devaluation cuts into potential gains too much."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more balanced split.  However, 55/45 still doesn't feel quite right.  I'm proposing 52/48 â€“ a slight shift, but one that acknowledges your movement while securing a more agreeable outcome for me.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. Let's meet in the middle with a 50/50 split. This ensures a fair outcome for both of us and avoids further risk of devaluation.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This seems like the best time to take the deal.  Alice has hit the 50/50 split, and while I was holding out for a slight edge, the continuous devaluation makes the risk of further negotiation outweigh the potential reward."
