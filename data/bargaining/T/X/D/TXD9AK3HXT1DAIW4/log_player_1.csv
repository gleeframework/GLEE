"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it quickly and we can avoid any potential inflation issues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a pretty unfair offer, and I don't want to set a precedent for accepting such lopsided deals.  I'm going to reject it and see what Bob's next offer is."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split this round. Since we're both experiencing inflation, I think it's fair to go with an equal division to avoid further conflict."
