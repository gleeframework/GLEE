"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leaving Bob with 40%, or $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 95% of its original value. 

I'll accept Bob's offer.
