Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this settled quickly.  I'm proposing a compromise for us to split the remaining value more evenly. Let's not let inflation eat away any more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
