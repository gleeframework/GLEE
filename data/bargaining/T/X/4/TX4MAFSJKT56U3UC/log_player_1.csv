"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose to take 90$ and leave 10$ for Bob.  I figure this is a good starting point, as I can take advantage of the higher inflation rate for Bob's money.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'm getting less than I initially proposed, it's still a decent gain, and I'm not sure I can do much better with the inflation rate."
