"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, offering to split the $100 evenly between us. This way, we both get $50, and we can end the game right here."
