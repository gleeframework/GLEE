Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm willing to come down to 800k, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is claiming this is her final offer, we still have plenty of rounds to go.  It's highly unlikely she'd rather walk away with nothing than accept a slightly less favorable deal. I'll continue pushing for a more equitable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this.  I'm being very generous, but I'd rather settle than risk both of us walking away with nothing.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my last chance offer. Let's not be stubborn and make a deal. We both get something. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly fixated on the 70/30 split. With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing. It's better to accept a less than ideal but reasonable offer now than to gamble on getting a better deal later and potentially losing everything."
