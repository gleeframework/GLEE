I'm going for a high initial offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he's happy with a small share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation factor.  It's better than risking further losses in future rounds."
