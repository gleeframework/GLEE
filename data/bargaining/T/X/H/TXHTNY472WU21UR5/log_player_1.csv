"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation factor. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation, it heavily favors him.  He's trying to take advantage of the situation to get a larger share. I need to hold firm and aim for a more equitable split, considering the inflation will continue to impact both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""That split wasn't fair, Bob. This offer accounts for inflation and gives us both a decent share.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Inflation:**  I'm shifting my offer to recognize the impact of inflation. Bob's share is slightly smaller than my previous offer, reflecting the decreasing value of the money over time.
* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm holding my ground on getting a larger share due to the inflation disparity, but I'm also offering Bob a reasonable amount to incentivize him to accept.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're running out of rounds, and I want to avoid reaching a point where the money becomes almost worthless. This offer aims to strike a balance between getting a fair deal and reaching an agreement quickly."
