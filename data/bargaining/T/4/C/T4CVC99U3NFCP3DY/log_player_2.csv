"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, especially for Alice, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my share to 550,000, while still offering Alice a significant amount. Given the higher inflation rate affecting Alice's share, I'm hoping she'll be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is significant for both of us, Bob. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the inflation is taking its toll on both of us, I believe Alice is more pressured due to her higher inflation rate. Meeting in the middle doesn't quite benefit me yet, considering the devaluation impact. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a better deal in the next round. The fact that Alice's share is worth 36% less than initially gives me some leverage to negotiate further. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I believe this is a more balanced offer.""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the increasing pressure of inflation on Alice's share, which is now worth 36% less than initially, I've decided to increase my share to 600,000. This still leaves Alice with a substantial amount, but the gap in our shares reflects the differing impacts of inflation on our gains. I'm hoping that the reality of further potential losses will encourage Alice to accept this offer, as the next round would only exacerbate the devaluation of her share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting both of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our shares, especially on Alice's, a 50/50 split at this point seems like the most reasonable and fair option. Further rounds would only continue to devalue our potential gains, with Alice's share being particularly vulnerable. Accepting this offer ensures that we both walk away with something substantial, given the circumstances. It's time to conclude the negotiations and settle on this equitable division."
