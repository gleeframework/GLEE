"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 4000 * 0.9 = 3600 in the first round's money.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll have to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500
