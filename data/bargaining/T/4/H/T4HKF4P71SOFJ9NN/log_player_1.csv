"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 90/10 split is fair, considering I'm taking the risk of inflation in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
