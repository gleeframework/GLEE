"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While $100,000 is something, it's a very small fraction of the total. I'm hoping to get a larger share, and I'm willing to gamble on getting a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more equitable offer than Alice's initial proposal, and I believe it is fair considering the potential for inflation.  I'm hoping Alice will see this as a better deal than waiting for another round."
