"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, let's take it 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I was hoping to get a better deal than 40% of the remaining 100$ (which is now worth 90$ due to inflation). I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for the next round to make my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining 90$ (which is now worth 81$ due to inflation) and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my initial offer, but still gives Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. Although I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, I'm not comfortable with giving him 55% of the remaining 81$ (which is now worth 72.9$ due to inflation). I was hoping for a slightly better deal than that. I'll wait for the next round to make my own proposal again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's getting late in the game""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split of the remaining 72.9$ (which is now worth 65.61$ due to inflation). I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway, hoping that he'll accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
