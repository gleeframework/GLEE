"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 60-40 in my favor, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this round, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gained in the first round still worth the same, I'm now looking at a 6,000$ gain, and Bob's offer is for me to take 2,000$. Since the money is worth the same for me, I'm not getting a good deal compared to the first round, and I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for 2,000$ for me, which is a smaller share than my initial offer of 6,000$, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still gives me a slightly larger share than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth the same for me, I'm looking at a 6,000$ gain, and Bob's offer is for me to take 4,000$. This is a better deal than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

However, considering the inflation, Bob's share is worth less than my share, so I'm inclined to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and potential even worse offers in the future.
