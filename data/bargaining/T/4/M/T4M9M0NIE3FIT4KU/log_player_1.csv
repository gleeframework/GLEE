"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount to start""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a decent amount considering the total, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair share 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the $7,000 I would gain is actually worth 5% less than the $8,000 I initially offered, and the $3,000 Bob would gain is worth 20% less than the $2,500 he would have gained in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll aim to get a larger share now.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Take the small amount, I'm not getting any younger""
}
```

This way, I'll take the larger share, but I'm leaving Bob with a small amount, hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

```

  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, take it or leave it""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small amount, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the $8,000 I would gain is actually worth 20% less than the $10,000 I initially had, and the $2,000 Bob would gain is worth 60% less than the $5,000 he would have gained in the first round.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. However, since the money is worth significantly less with each passing round, I think it's getting to the point where I should accept a decent offer to get something.

I'll accept this offer.
