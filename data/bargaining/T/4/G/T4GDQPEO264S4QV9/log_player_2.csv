"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to the higher inflation rate I face. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm going to be strategic here. Even though Alice is facing a higher inflation rate, I can leverage that to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see what she proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. While I understand your higher inflation rate, I also need to secure a good portion for myself. This offer is more balanced, giving you a decent share while still ensuring I receive a significant amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but my need to settle quickly is very real. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging your desire for a larger share while still being favorable for me considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is better than what I would get if I reject it and she makes the next offer. The inflation is starting to impact my gains significantly. It's time to be practical and secure a decent amount before the money becomes even less valuable."
