"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer gives you a good portion, and I still get a fair share.  Let's end this now and avoid further inflation losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hurting us both, but it's hurting me more. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a few more rounds."
