Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try to compromise.  I'll take a bit less to see if we can get this done. 
# Bob gain: 53 
# Alice gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to budge a little more, but I don't think I can go lower than this.  We need to reach a compromise soon. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is unlikely to offer me a better deal. Taking $55 now is better than risking getting nothing later.
