Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob."

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I propose 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob. Due to inflation, I'm willing to accept a slightly lower share than my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, accepting this offer is still better than risking another round and potentially getting an even worse offer."
