"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $1,000,000, which is $400,000. I'll take the remaining $600,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20%, but I think it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the $200,000 I would gain is actually worth $180,000. This is a better offer than the previous one, but I'd like to try to get more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be a bit more aggressive this time. I'll aim to get a bigger share, but not too greedy.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, I'll take 55%""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 30%, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, the $300,000 I would gain is actually worth $219,300. This is a good offer, considering the current market conditions.
