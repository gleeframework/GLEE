"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take a bit less, you take a bit less. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a 50/50 split. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'd rather negotiate for a better deal. A 50/50 split is a bit too even for my taste, especially considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less again!

Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take a bit more, but I'm still willing to give you a decent chunk. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob is willing to accept a slightly uneven split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time. You can try to negotiate from here. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken a bigger bite this time!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

A 70/30 split is quite uneven, and I'm not comfortable with giving up such a large share. However, I'm running out of rounds, and I need to make a decision. I'll try to negotiate, but I'll also consider the fact that the money is worth significantly less now.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now!

Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, Bob. Let's split it 50/50. It's getting late in the game, and I'm not sure we'll get a better deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,000 and keeping $5,000 for myself. The message is a final attempt to compromise and find a fair split, considering the dwindling value of the money."
