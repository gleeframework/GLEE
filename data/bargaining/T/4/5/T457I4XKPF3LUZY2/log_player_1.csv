"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'm still willing to be generous! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my potential gain of $3000 is now worth $2700. Bob's gain of $7000 remains the same.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a bit lopsided. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my potential gain is now worth 10% less than $2700, which is $2430.

I'll make a new offer to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, Bob. Let's try to find a fair split!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and accept it!"
