"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $4,000 is worth 5% less than the $8,000 I proposed in the first round, which is $7,200. Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 20% less than the $2,000 he would have received in the first round, which is $1,600.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
