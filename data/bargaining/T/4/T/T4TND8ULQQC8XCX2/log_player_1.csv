"Round 1

I'm proposing to take 9000 and give Bob 1000.  Since the money depreciates for me, I'm aiming for a large share in the early rounds.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While 1000 is better than nothing, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. It's only round 2, and the money is losing value for me with each passing round, but I'm still in a strong position since I'll get to propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm offering Bob 2800 this round.  I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation and to try and get Bob to agree.  Hopefully, this is enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer.  While I'm losing a significant amount of value due to the inflation, I believe that I can still get a better deal.  I will have the opportunity to propose in the next round, and with each passing round, Bob's bargaining power will increase. I need to hold out for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is really starting to bite, and I'm worried about losing too much value.  I'm offering Bob an equal share this time. This is a significant concession on my part, but I believe that a 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the circumstances.  Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer and end the game."
