Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the clock is working against me. I'm proposing 58/42. This recognizes your desire for a larger share while still reflecting the impact inflation has on my gains.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop this back and forth.  I'm offering 57/43.  This is a compromise and accounts for the time pressure we're both under.  Let's be pragmatic and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working against her.  While she is making concessions, they aren't significant enough yet. I'll hold out for a slightly better offer, knowing that each round makes her increasingly willing to accept a smaller share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 58,
""alice_gain"": 42,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering 56/44 - my lowest offer.  Take it or leave it.  We're running out of time, and I'd rather walk away with something than nothing. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is drawing a line in the sand and her patience is wearing thin. While not ideal,  accepting 44 is better than risking getting nothing if she follows through with her threat to walk away."
