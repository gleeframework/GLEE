"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a little, but I still think 55-45 is a fair split, considering inflation is hurting you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the current offer
Alice is offering a 55-45 split in her favor. Considering the inflation, my gain of $45 is worth 19% less than in the first round.

### Step 2: Calculate the real value of my gain
My gain of $45 is actually worth $45 * 0.81 = $36.45, due to the 19% decrease in value.

### Step 3: Consider the offer
The offer seems reasonable, but I should consider the decreasing value of the money for me. Since Alice is not affected by inflation, she might not be willing to compromise much further.

### Step 4: Make a decision
Given the current situation, I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Evaluate the current situation
I have rejected Alice's offer of a 55-45 split in her favor. Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. I need to make a new offer that takes this into account.

### Step 2: Determine my minimum acceptable gain
Since the money is worth 19% less to me, I should aim for a higher nominal value to compensate for the loss. Let's assume I want to get at least $50 in real value.

### Step 3: Calculate my nominal gain
To get $50 in real value, my nominal gain should be $50 / 0.81 = $61.73.

### Step 4: Make an offer
I will offer a split of 62-38 in my favor, which is close to my calculated nominal gain. This way, I can try to get a better deal while still considering the inflation.

### Step 5: Attach a message to the offer
I will attach a message explaining my reasoning and trying to convince Alice to accept my offer.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make up for the loss. 62-38 is a fair split, don't you think?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll go up to 58, but that's my final offer.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's settle this! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the current offer
Alice is offering a 58-42 split in her favor. Considering the inflation, my gain of $42 is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

### Step 2: Calculate the real value of my gain
My gain of $42 is actually worth $42 * 0.6559 = $27.55, due to the 34.39% decrease in value.

### Step 3: Consider the offer
The offer seems reasonable, but I should consider the decreasing value of the money for me. Since Alice is not affected by inflation, she might not be willing to compromise much further.

### Step 4: Make a decision
Given the current situation, I will accept the offer. The real value of my gain is lower than I initially wanted, but it's better to settle now than to risk losing more value in the next rounds.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
