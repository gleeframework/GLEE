"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This offer splits the money in a way that seems fair, giving me a slight advantage while still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than my original offer, and even though the money is worth less now, I can still make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm willing to lower my share slightly, but I still want to ensure I get a larger portion. The inflation is starting to bite, and I want to get a good deal before it gets worse."
