"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fair but slightly self-serving offer, hoping to secure a good chunk of the money early on. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal, and I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a good portion of the money. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in getting some money now rather than risking it all in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a far cry from my initial goal, the inflation is really starting to bite, and I can't be sure I'll get a better deal in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and at this point, that's better than nothing."
