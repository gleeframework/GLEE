Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need you to meet me halfway. This offer considers the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate and trying to make it seem like she's compromising, but she's not. The devaluation of the money continues to hurt her more than me.  I need to hold firm and make it clear I won't accept an unfair deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous.  Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. It's the only fair way, and we're running out of time."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to draw a line in the sand. Offering a 50/50 split is the fairest option, and it highlights the absurdity of Alice's increasingly desperate attempts to take advantage of the situation. This strong stance might encourage her to be more realistic and avoid a total loss for both of us."
