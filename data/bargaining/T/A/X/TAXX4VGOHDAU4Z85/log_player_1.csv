Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough situation, but I still think we can do better. Bob is clearly taking advantage of the inflation working against me.  We need to push him towards a more equitable split before the value drops too much further."

# Bob gain: 60

This is frustrating, but I need to hold firm.  Accepting 40% of the original amount at this stage would be a significant loss.  Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation, but I believe he'll be forced to be more reasonable as we approach the final rounds."

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

This is agonizing, but I can't accept this offer. While the value is rapidly decreasing, I believe Bob is bluffing and will be forced to offer a larger share soon to avoid both of us walking away with nothing. I'm betting on his greed to secure a slightly better outcome, even if it means risking everything."

It's a huge risk, but I need to convey a sense of urgency and finality.  By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping Bob will recognize the very real possibility of getting nothing and concede a slightly larger share.  It's a gamble, but the clock is ticking."

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not satisfied. Considering the massive loss you're facing due to inflation, I think this is more than fair. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

This is incredibly frustrating, but I have to accept.  Bob is clearly playing hardball and is willing to risk getting nothing.  With only two rounds left, the value for me will plummet to almost nothing.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting 35% now is better than risking getting nothing at all."
