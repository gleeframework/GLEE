Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a tough start. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Think carefully, the value decreases faster for you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
