"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I think this is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced share, but I'm willing to consider it. After all, it's still a deal!

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 30% share, which is $30, and Bob will get the remaining 70%, which is $70."
