"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm the one making the proposal this time. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money is worth less for Bob, but I'm still getting the same amount as before.

I'm not too keen on the 60/40 split, as it seems unfair to me. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split, which is closer to 50/50 but still gives me a slight advantage.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! 55/45 is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
