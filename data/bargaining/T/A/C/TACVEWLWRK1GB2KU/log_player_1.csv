"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  Inflation is a factor, and the risk of getting nothing is high.  A 50/50 split ensures I get something, even if it's less than I initially wanted."
