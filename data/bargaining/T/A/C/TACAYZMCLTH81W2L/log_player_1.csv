I'm going for a big chunk in the first round, hoping Bob is willing to take a smaller share to avoid risking further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm reducing my gain slightly to account for inflation, but still aiming for a larger share. I'm hoping Bob will realize that he's already lost a significant amount due to inflation and will accept this offer to avoid further losses."
