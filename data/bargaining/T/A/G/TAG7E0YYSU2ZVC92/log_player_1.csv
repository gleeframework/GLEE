"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a larger share this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

I'm proposing a slightly skewed split, with me getting a bit more to make up for the lost value due to inflation."

# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential earnings! Considering the reduced value of the money I'd gain, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is still getting a larger share, I'll have to decide whether it's better to accept this offer or risk waiting for a better one. I'll choose to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings now. I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal to make up for it. Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing a more skewed split, with me getting a larger share to compensate for the lost value due to inflation."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings now. Considering the significantly reduced value of the money I'd gain, I think it's time to be more cautious. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or risk waiting for a better one. However, the difference in value between this offer and the previous one is not significant enough to justify another round of negotiations. I'll accept this offer.
