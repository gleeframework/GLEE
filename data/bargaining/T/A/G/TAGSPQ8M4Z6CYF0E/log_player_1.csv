Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split the money more evenly. I'll take 60, and you take 40. This way, we can both avoid the worst of the inflation and get a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
