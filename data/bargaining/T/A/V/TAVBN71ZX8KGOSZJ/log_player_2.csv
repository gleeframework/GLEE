Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it closer to even this time, and we can both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation factor is starting to hurt, but holding out for a better deal is still the best option.  A 50/50 split is unlikely, but I need to aim for something closer to that to make the inflation hit worthwhile."
