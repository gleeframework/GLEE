"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept this fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. I'm not sure I want to give up 2/3 of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500 and keeping $4,500 for myself, trying to find a more balanced split."
