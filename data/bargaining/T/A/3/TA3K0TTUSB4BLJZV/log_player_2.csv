"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 28 
# Alice gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $28 is worth 71% of what it would have been in the first round, and Alice's gain of $72 is worth 80% of what it would have been in the first round.

I'll accept this offer to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of my potential gain.
