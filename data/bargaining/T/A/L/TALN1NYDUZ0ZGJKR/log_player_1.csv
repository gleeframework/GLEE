Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. While it's true the inflation is impacting him, he's now asking for more than I offered in the previous round. I need to hold firm and make it clear I'm aiming for a better deal."

This is getting ridiculous. Bob is getting desperate and trying to pressure me with the inflation, but this offer is worse than his first one! I need to hold my ground, but I also need to signal I'm willing to be reasonable."
