"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share, but you get a nice chunk to start with.  Think about the future rounds, though - your share will be worth less and less! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 10% inflation rate is a significant factor, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a better deal."
