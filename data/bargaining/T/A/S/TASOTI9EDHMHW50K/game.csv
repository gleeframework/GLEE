9000.0,1000.0,"Let's make a deal where I take $9000 and you get $1000.  It's in your best interest to accept now, as the value decreases for you in further rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor, considering the value of the money is decreasing for me with each round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'm offering you $3500, which is more than you would have gotten last round considering the inflation.  It's only going to get worse for you if we wait.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. It's still a fair deal, considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking, and each round sees the value of your potential gain diminish. I'm offering you $3000. Take this deal now before inflation eats away at it further!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I understand the inflation is affecting my gains, but I believe a 65/35 split is still fair considering the risk of going further. Let's end this here and agree to this.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. $2500 is the most I'm willing to concede, considering the significant loss in value you're facing with each passing round. Let's wrap this up!",Alice,7,
