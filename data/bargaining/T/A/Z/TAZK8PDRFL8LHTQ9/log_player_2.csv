"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, with me taking 90% and you taking 10%.  Let's get this game started! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept a deal where I get only 10% of the money.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I'm offering you a 45% share, which is still a pretty good deal.  Accept this and we can both walk away happy.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money 60/40, with me taking the larger share.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation, and allows us to both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a more even split, accepting this offer gives me a decent amount of money and avoids further risk of inflation."
