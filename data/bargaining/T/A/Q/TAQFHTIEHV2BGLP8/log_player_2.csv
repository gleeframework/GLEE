"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonably fair split. We can adjust slightly in later rounds if needed. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal before the value decreases further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to avoid further losses from inflation.""}\n\nSince the value of money decreases by 5% in each round, I'd like to propose a 50/50 split to minimize the impact of inflation and ensure we both get a fair share."
