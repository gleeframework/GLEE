"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider the offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the equivalent value in the first round:

$4,000 / 0.8 = $5,000

So, in the first round, Bob's offer would be equivalent to $5,000. Since I offered $2,000 in the first round, I'm getting a better deal now.

I accept the offer.
