Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  Since the money is worth 20% less to Bob with each passing round, he has a strong incentive to take anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is much better than my previous one, I still have the advantage of the next round.  The money I gain will be worth the same, but the value of Bob's gain will be 20% less. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a small increase from his previous offer, but I'm still taking the lion's share. With inflation hitting Bob harder, I'm confident he'll accept this offer to avoid losing more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  The money he gets is worth considerably less than in the first round due to inflation, and if I reject this, I run the risk of him getting a bigger share in the next round. While I'm getting less than I initially hoped for, it's still a decent amount of money."
