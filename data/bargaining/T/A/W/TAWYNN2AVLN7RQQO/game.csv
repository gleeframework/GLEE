,,,Bob,1,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I appreciate the fair start, Alice, but I think we can both do better. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor, as I'm taking on the risk of this round's inflation.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",Bob,2,
,,"That's a significant jump in your favor, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. Let's try to find something more equitable.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's find some middle ground.  I'm proposing 55/45.  It acknowledges the risk you're taking with inflation but keeps things fairer for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4250.0,5750.0,"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to compromise further and offer a 57.5/42.5 split.  This reflects the growing inflation risk, but still keeps things relatively fair.  Let's make a deal before the value of the money dwindles too much.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I appreciate the movement towards the middle, but this deal still disproportionately impacts me due to the inflation. I'm willing to accept a deal where we both share the burden of inflation, but this isn't it. Let's try again.",Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast.  I'm proposing a 52/48 split.  It's a small compromise on my previous offer and acknowledges the time pressure we're both under.  Let's close this deal and avoid losing out completely.",Alice,5,
