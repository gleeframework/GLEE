"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work something out in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation and the fact that we have multiple rounds. Rejecting allows me to propose a more balanced split later on, taking advantage of the inflation to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
