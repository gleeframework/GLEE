"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and will allow us both to benefit from the money sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this split is a bit more fair. Let's move forward and avoid losing any more value to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair deal, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. However, we need to consider the shrinking pot. This offer ensures we both get a decent share before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a decent offer, and the value of the money is quickly decreasing. Let's take it and move on."
