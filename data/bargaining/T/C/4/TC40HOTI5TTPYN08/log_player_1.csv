"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob. This ensures a significant gain for me while leaving a small amount for Bob, hoping he'll accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation means my initial offer is worth significantly less now. A 500,000 split is a fair compromise at this point."
