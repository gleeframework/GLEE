Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I think I can do better than that! With a 60/40 split, Bob is getting a larger share of the money, and I'm not sure I'm willing to give him such a big chunk. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
