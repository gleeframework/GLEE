"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not giving away all the money yet.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too stingy, now it's your turn to be fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more generous now that the money is worth less.

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
