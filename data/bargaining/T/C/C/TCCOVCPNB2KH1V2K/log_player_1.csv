I'm going for a greedy approach first! I'll take almost everything and see if Bob is willing to accept such a small amount.  Let's see how this goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the guaranteed half than risk getting nothing at all. I'm not sure how inflation will affect things in the future, and I don't want to gamble with a large sum like this."
