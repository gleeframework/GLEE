Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept, as I'm taking a significant share.  But I'm also aware that inflation could impact his decision in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting me hard. I'm losing 5% of my potential gains each round, and Bob's offer, while not ideal, is still better than risking getting even less in the future."
