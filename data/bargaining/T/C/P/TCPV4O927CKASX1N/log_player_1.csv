"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share now and avoid a worse deal later! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $100,000 is now only $80,000. Bob's gain of $900,000 is now $720,000. I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% less from the first round and another 20% from the second round), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and we can end this quickly!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting low on time, take a slightly better deal now! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $300,000 is now only $160,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is now $340,000. I'm running out of time and options, so I'll accept this offer.
