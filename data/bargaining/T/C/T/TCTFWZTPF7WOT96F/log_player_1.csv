"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob is offering a slightly skewed split in his favor, I'll reject his offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll adjust my offer to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to myself, but still keeping it relatively balanced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! Given the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively balanced split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept his offer.
