"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation is hurting you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The inflation is hurting me, Bob, but let's be reasonable. This is my counter-offer.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking its toll on your share, Alice. I think it's time for me to take a bigger slice. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly using the inflation to his advantage. While I'm feeling the pressure, accepting an offer below 50% is not in my best interest, at least not yet. I need to show Bob I'm willing to walk away if he pushes me too far."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being generous considering the inflation is really hurting your share now. This is a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This is getting dangerous. Bob is getting greedier, but I can't afford to accept anything less than 4000 right now. I need to hold on a bit longer and see if he panics."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or I walk in the next round. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time for a power play. I need to show Bob I'm serious about walking away. Offering him a slight advantage while still securing a decent amount for myself is the best strategy at this point. The threat of me rejecting his offer in the next round and getting nothing might be enough to make him reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think you'll still take a deal that's slightly worse for you. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly bluffing. He knows I'm desperate, but he's pushing his luck. I said I would walk, and I meant it. Accepting this offer would just encourage him to exploit me further. It's a huge risk, but I have to stand my ground."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 0,
""bob_gain"": 10000,
""message"": ""You were right, Bob. I was bluffing. Take it all.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a desperate, high-risk gamble. Bob knows I'm desperate and likely to accept a bad deal. However, by offering him everything, I'm appealing to his sense of fairness and potentially his fear of me walking away with nothing. It's a long shot, but it's better than accepting a paltry sum or walking away empty-handed. 

Here's why this might work:

* **Guilt:** Offering him everything might induce guilt, especially after I bluffed about walking away. He might feel bad taking advantage of me at this stage.
* **Fear:** Bob might worry that if he rejects this offer, I'll follow through on my previous threat and walk away in the next round, leaving him with nothing. 

This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. There's a chance Bob will call my bluff and take everything, but there's also a chance this act of desperation will work in my favor."
