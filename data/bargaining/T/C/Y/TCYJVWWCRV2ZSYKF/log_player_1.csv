"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1. I keep 75%, while you keep 25%. Let me know if this works for you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split, taking 51$ and leaving 49$ for you. Since we're moving to the next round, the money is worth less for me, so this is a fair offer. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
