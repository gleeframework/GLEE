"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20% of the initial $100, which is $20."
