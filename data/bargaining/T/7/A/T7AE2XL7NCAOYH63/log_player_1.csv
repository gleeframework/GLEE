"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Bob's offer is still quite generous to me, but I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money! Given the reduced value of the money, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous to me, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
