"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and Bob will get 40% of the original $100, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value. 

If I accept this offer, I'll get 45% of the original $100, which is $45, but due to inflation, it's worth $45 * 0.9 = $40.50 in the first round's value. 

I'll accept this offer.
