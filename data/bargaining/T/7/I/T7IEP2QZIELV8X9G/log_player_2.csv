"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, Bob.  Take the 1000, or we can play another round.  But remember, your share will be worth less next time. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal.\n\n###\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'll propose a division that I think is more favorable to me.\n\n###\nAlso, please clarify how the inflation works. Does it mean that if I were to accept the $1000 in the next round, it would be worth $900 to me? Or would the 10% reduction apply to the total amount of $10,000, and then my share would be calculated from that reduced amount? I want to make sure I understand the rules correctly before making my next move.\n\n###\nLooking forward to the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, the total amount is now worth $9,000 to me. I'll propose a division that takes this into account.\n\n###\nHere's my offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\nI'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's more generous than her initial proposal. The message is a brief explanation of my reasoning, taking into account the inflation that affects my share.\n\n###\nPlease relay this offer to Alice and let me know her response.\n\n###\nLooking forward to her decision!"
