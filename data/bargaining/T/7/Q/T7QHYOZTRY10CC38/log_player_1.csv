"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the original $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round, my gain of $6,000 in the second round is actually equivalent to $4,800 in the first round.

I'll think about Bob's offer... and decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less after two rounds of inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me, considering the inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, considering the inflation. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the equivalent value of the gains in the first round...

Since the money is worth 48.8% less after four rounds, I'll convert Bob's offer to the equivalent value in the first round.

Bob's offer in the first round would be:
$6,500 / 0.516 (1 - 0.488) â‰ˆ $12,600

That's a very generous offer!

I'll accept Bob's offer.
