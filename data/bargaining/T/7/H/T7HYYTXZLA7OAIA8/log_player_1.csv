"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal for myself. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm now considering the value of the money in terms of the new reduced value. In this case, Bob's offer is:

* I would get $70, which is worth 80% of the original $90 (since it's 20% less)
* Bob would get $30, which is worth 90% of the original $33.33 (since it's 10% less)

Considering the reduced value, I'm not thrilled about this offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try to find a fair split.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally divide the money."
