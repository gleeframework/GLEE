# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While the deal is getting ""better,"" it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold my ground a bit longer, but I might consider accepting a slightly better offer in the next round or two."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the wire. This offer is my final compromise.  Take it, or we risk getting nothing! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on.  While this offer is still far from ideal, rejecting it carries a significant risk. If Alice doesn't budge much from here, I could end up with a considerably smaller share, or even nothing. It's time to cut my losses and secure a reasonable amount."
