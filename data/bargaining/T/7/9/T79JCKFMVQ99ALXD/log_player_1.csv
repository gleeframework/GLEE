"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the effective values are:

Alice's gain: $4000 / 0.95 = $4210.53
Bob's gain: $6000 / 0.95 = $6315.79

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less again, so the effective value is:

$10,000 / 0.95 = $10,526.32

I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think we can do better than last time. What do you think?""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the effective value is:

$10,000 / 0.8584 = $11,650.19

Effective values for Bob's offer:

Alice's gain: $4800 / 0.8584 = $5600.34
