"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a small share to start. I want to see if he's willing to negotiate, or if he'll be more aggressive in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair, but I want to see if I can get more. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and the inflation factor is pushing him to want to settle sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount. I want to see if I can secure a more favorable deal before the inflation factor becomes too significant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is quite a bit lower than the previous round. It seems like he's trying to push me into accepting something unfavorable. I'm still not convinced he's willing to settle for such a small share. I'll reject this offer and see if I can improve my position in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm still trying to get a larger share, but I'm also recognizing that the inflation is starting to have a significant impact. I'm offering Bob a more generous share compared to the previous round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable, but I'm still hesitant to accept it.  The inflation is a major concern, but I believe I can still get a better deal if I hold out a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly bigger share, but I'm still aiming for a majority.  The inflation is a major concern, but I'm hoping that this offer will be more attractive to Bob than his last proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is getting out of control! While I'd still like a larger share,  Bob's offer is a fair split given the current circumstances.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure something before the value of the money continues to plummet."
