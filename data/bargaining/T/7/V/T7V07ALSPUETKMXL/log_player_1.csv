"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're starting with $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $6,000 is now worth less, but Bob's $4,000 is also worth slightly less than before.

I'm not sure if I want to give up my chance to negotiate further, but Bob's 50/50 offer is a good one. I'll think about it...

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in round 2, so I need to be more cautious with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much. Think about it carefully!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is a slight increase from his 50/50 offer in round 2. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! My $6,000 from the first round is now worth less than $3,000.

I'm not sure if I want to give up even more, but Bob's offer is a good one. I'm not sure if I can do better, and I don't want to risk going to another round with even lower gains.

I'll accept this offer.
