"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's a significant gain for me, I believe I can get a better deal by playing the game.  Since the inflation is more severe for me than for Bob, it's in my interest to keep playing and see if I can secure a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping a significant portion of the money. Bob is likely feeling the pressure of inflation too, and I hope this offer will be attractive enough to end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for me, and this offer guarantees me a fair share. Even though I would have preferred to get a slightly larger portion, I'm satisfied with an equal split at this point."
