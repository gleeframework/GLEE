"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial 100$, leaving 30% for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to 4:6, still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite comfortable with the 4:6 split, and I'd like to keep pushing for a better deal. Let's see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move! Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly adjusted. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle at 55:45, let's shake on it!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a more balanced split, hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise at 50:50, a fair and balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

With the inflation eating away at my potential earnings, I think the 50:50 split is a reasonable compromise. It's a fair deal, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further losses."
