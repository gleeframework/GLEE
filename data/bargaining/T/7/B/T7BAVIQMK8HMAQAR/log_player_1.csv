Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  Let's end this quickly and fairly.

# Bob gain: 5000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer is fair considering the inflation. I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid further losses. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this is the same offer Bob gave in Round 1, inflation has significantly eroded the value of his share. Accepting now guarantees me the same amount I wanted initially, and Bob is likely feeling the pressure to settle before his potential gains decrease even further."
