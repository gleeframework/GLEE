"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40.  It's important to settle this early as the value decreases quickly for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I think I can do better than $40. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's both get a bit more this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this deal is getting worse for both of us with every round. I'm willing to compromise, let's split it $55/$45. It's better than what we'll have in a few more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I think it's better to take what I can get before the value decreases even further."
