# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is almost worthless at this point!

Considering the extremely reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth accepting such a small share. However, I think it's better than getting nothing at all.
