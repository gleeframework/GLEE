Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you hard, I'll give you a little break, but I still deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The longer the game goes on, the less favorable the outcome for Bob due to the relentless inflation. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's better to secure something now (43) rather than risk getting an even lower offer in subsequent rounds where the value will further diminish."
