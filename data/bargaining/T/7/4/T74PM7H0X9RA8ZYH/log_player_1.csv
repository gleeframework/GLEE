"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small amount, but it ensures that I get the majority of the money. Since the money will be worth less in the next round, it's in my best interest to secure as much as possible now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial offer. While the money is worth less in each round, I am still losing a greater percentage of my potential gains than Bob is. I will reject this offer and try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I am lowering my desired amount slightly to account for the decreasing value of money. However, I still believe this offer is fair and should be acceptable to Bob, considering the inflation affecting both of us."
