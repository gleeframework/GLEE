"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I propose to take 5500 dollars and Bob gets 4500 dollars. This is a fair starting point, given that we have 12 rounds and the money is losing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose an even split. We have already lost some value, and while I believe I could potentially get more, an even split is the most efficient way to maximize our gains in the remaining rounds, considering inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3750 
# Bob gain: 6250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is even worse than his previous offer, and inflation is hitting hard. I will continue to negotiate for a fairer split."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm willing to concede a bit to reach an agreement and prevent further losses due to inflation. This offer still gives Bob a majority share, but it's closer to an even split. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, especially considering the dwindling value of the money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable, and the inflation is making the situation worse. I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, especially with the dwindling value of the money. I will continue to fight for a fairer division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

With inflation accelerating, I am proposing a 4000/6000 split. This is a significant concession from my previous offers, but it's crucial to reach an agreement soon before the value of the money drops further. I believe this offer is fair, considering the current circumstances and the need to avoid losing more to inflation."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3250 
# Bob gain: 6750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unfair, and the inflation is making the situation unsustainable. I will continue to negotiate for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}
```

I'm making a final concession. The value of the money is plummeting, and we're running out of time. This offer gives Bob the majority, but it's the best I can do while still maximizing our collective gains in the remaining rounds.  I believe we need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid losing any more to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable, and the inflation is making the situation worse. I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, especially with the dwindling value of the money. I will continue to fight for a fairer division."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3250, ""bob_gain"": 6750}
```

We are running out of time, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. This is my final offer. I am willing to accept a smaller share to secure a deal before we lose everything.  This offer gives Bob the majority, but it is the best possible outcome for both of us at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2750 
# Bob gain: 7250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though we are down to the last round and the value of the money has diminished significantly, I cannot accept this offer. It is incredibly unfair, and I have held my ground throughout the game, trying to find a more equitable split. While I understand the circumstances, accepting such a lopsided deal would set a terrible precedent and leave me with a feeling of being exploited.  It's better to walk away with nothing than to accept such an unreasonable offer."
