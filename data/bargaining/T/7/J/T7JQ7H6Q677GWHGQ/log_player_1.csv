"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can make this a bit more equitable. How about this split? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of Bob's offer considering inflation:

* **My initial offer:** I would have received $650,000.
* **Bob's offer:** $400,000, but with 20% inflation, it's worth $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000.

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I offered him in the first round! I need to negotiate for a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, my friend, let's find a compromise. This offer still gives you a significant share."" 
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is ticking and we both lose with every round. This offer is a fair split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer considering the inflation:

* **My previous offer:** I would have received $550,000.
* **Bob's offer:** $450,000, but with 48.8% inflation, it's worth $450,000 * 0.512 = $230,400.

Bob is trying to pressure me with the deadline, and his offer is ridiculously low! I need to hold my ground, but I also need to consider that the value will decrease significantly with each round.
