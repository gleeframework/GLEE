"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This is a fairly generous offer for the first round, as I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he's going to be stubborn.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of my generosity.  I won't accept this unfair offer!  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to try to find a more equitable split this time. 5500/4500 is a more fair offer, as it's closer to a 50/50 split. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided.  I'm not going to give in to his pressure tactics.  Let's see what he does next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This time I'm going for a 50/50 split. I think it's the fairest option and  I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that we need to cooperate to get anything at all."
