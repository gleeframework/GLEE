"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 4:1, but I'll be generous""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm willing to compromise to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5

I accept this offer. It's indeed a fair and even split, and I don't want to risk going into more rounds and losing more value due to inflation.
