"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, to see if he's willing to accept a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is less valuable to me than it was in the first round. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60% of the total, I'll try to offer a slightly higher percentage to Bob, but still keep a significant portion for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up control yet.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's end this game with a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds reasonable, and it's a fair compromise. I'll accept this offer and end the game.
