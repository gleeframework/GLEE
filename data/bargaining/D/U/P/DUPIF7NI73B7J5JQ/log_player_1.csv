"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Considering the inflation, I believe this is a more fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand the time constraint is affecting us both. How about we settle in the middle?  I'll take $55, leaving you with $45.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation affecting your share, I think this is a generous offer. The longer we wait, the less you'll get. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is using manipulative tactics, emphasizing the inflation to pressure me into accepting a bad deal. While the value of the money decreases for me with each round, I still hold the power to make proposals. Holding on a bit longer might push Bob to offer a more reasonable split."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose if this drags on.  $52 for me and $48 for you is a decent compromise. Don't you think?""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: At this point, every round is costing you dearly. I'm willing to end this, but I need a fair share. This is my most generous offer yet. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation. He knows the inflation is hurting me more, and his offers barely budge. It's a waiting game now, and I need to show some resolve to see if he'll crack and offer something more reasonable.  I'm willing to risk it for a couple more rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and be done with it. $50 each. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing a significant amount each round. I'm willing to end this, but the even split offer is no longer on the table. This is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Although not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is severely impacting my potential earnings. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for me.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently rejected offers leaning towards a fairer split. He seems set on taking advantage of the inflation situation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk. If Bob doesn't offer a better deal in the remaining rounds, I'll end up with nothing.

It's disappointing to settle for less than a fair share, but with the current circumstances and the rapidly diminishing value, accepting this offer minimizes potential losses."
