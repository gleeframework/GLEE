Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take a little less this time, $55, and you get $45.  Time is ticking, and the deal is getting worse for me every round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
