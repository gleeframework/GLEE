Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that heavily favors me. I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round, as the value of the money will decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with only getting 20%, the value of the money is decreasing, and if I reject this offer, I might end up with less in the next round. Accepting is the more logical choice."
