I propose to take 9000 dollars and let Bob have 1000 dollars.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I am risking more in the future rounds with the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed gain to 8000, while still offering Bob 2000. I'm hoping he'll see that this is a fair compromise, as he rejected my previous offer and the money is worth less to him with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering Bob 3000, hoping he'll finally see the value of accepting an offer, considering his money is decreasing in value faster than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

``` 
Bob's offer is getting better for me, but I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth less for both of us with each passing round, I'm confident that I can convince him to accept an offer where I receive more than 3000 dollars in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000 dollars this time. It's getting risky, as the value of money is decreasing for both of us. However, with each passing round, the value of his money is decreasing at a much higher rate. I'm confident that he will see this as a good opportunity to get something, even though it's less than he's been asking for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, I'm still betting on the decreasing value of money for him.  I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're getting close to the end, and the value of the money is diminishing rapidly, especially for Bob. I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping he'll finally realize that getting something is better than nothing."
