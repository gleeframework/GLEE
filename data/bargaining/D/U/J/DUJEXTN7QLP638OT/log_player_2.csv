Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the value is decreasing, it's still better to hold out a bit longer. Alice knows the clock is ticking and I'm feeling the pressure of inflation.  There's a chance she'll offer a bit more in the next round or two, and even a small increase is better than accepting a bad deal now."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""I'm taking a hit from inflation. This is my best offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time to show some flexibility and signal I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a slightly better deal than what Alice has offered so far."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing your share, take this 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is really hurting now. While this isn't a great offer, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to reject and the rounds progress further. It's getting too risky, and taking the sure thing is the more logical choice at this point."
