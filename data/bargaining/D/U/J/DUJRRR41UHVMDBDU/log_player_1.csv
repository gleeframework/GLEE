"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost all of the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, as Bob could easily reject this offer. However, if he does, I'll have 11 more rounds to try and secure a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a clear case of ""take it or leave it"" from Bob. While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm in a much better position to negotiate in the coming rounds. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to compromise in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the money, which is a significant increase from the last round. I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid further inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still being very stubborn, but I'm not giving up yet. I'm losing more money with each passing round, but I'm hoping that with more rounds remaining, Bob will eventually be willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, giving him 20% of the money. This is a substantial offer, and I'm hoping it will finally convince him to accept. I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation, but I'm still holding out for a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still holding strong, but I'm not giving up. I'm losing a significant amount of money, but I'm still in a better position than in the previous round. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to compromise in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to increase my offer to Bob, giving him 30% of the money. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping that it will finally convince Bob to accept. We're both losing money due to inflation, and the longer we wait, the worse the outcome for both of us.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this offer and ending the game."
