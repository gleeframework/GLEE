"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money into 75/25, hoping it's fair considering the potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
