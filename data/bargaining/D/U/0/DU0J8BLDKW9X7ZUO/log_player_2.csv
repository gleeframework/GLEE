"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk to start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a $100,000 starting amount is tempting, there are many rounds left and the value of money is decreasing rapidly.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's split it a little more evenly. I believe this is a good starting point for a fair deal.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like a more even split, the value of the money is dropping fast. Accepting this offer ensures a significant sum for me, and getting something is better than nothing."
