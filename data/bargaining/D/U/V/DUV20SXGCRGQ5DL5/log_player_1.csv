"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that tries to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness while still giving me a slight advantage. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting our equal contributions. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer because I feel that it doesn't acknowledge my initial attempt at fairness. Since we both made similar offers, but with the splits reversed, I think there's still room for negotiation to find a more mutually agreeable division. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nI'm offering a compromise by moving closer to the middle, giving Bob a bit more than my initial offer. The message is a clear invitation to meet halfway, hoping Bob will see the reasonableness in finding a middle ground. Let's see how Bob responds!"
