Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

This way, we both get a decent share, and we can still have a chance to negotiate further if needed."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I'll still consider the offer. Since I'll be gaining less in absolute value, I'll think carefully. Here's my decision:
