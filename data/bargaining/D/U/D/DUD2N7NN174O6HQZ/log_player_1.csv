"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000 and take $6,000 for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering a relatively even split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50/50 split seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns."
