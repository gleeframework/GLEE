Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 
Let's start with a fair 50/50 split.  I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable.  Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is way too unfair!  I'll reject it and make my own offer in the next round.  I'll see if I can get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly better split for Bob than the original 50/50, hoping to encourage him to accept.  I'm confident I can still get a good share of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still incredibly unfair!  He's taking advantage of the inflation to try and get almost all the money. I'll reject this offer again and try to get a more reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  With each passing round, the money is worth less, so I need to make a strong offer to ensure I get something!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is absurdly unfair!  He's just trying to take advantage of the situation.  I refuse to accept such a tiny amount of money.  I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm going to make a bold offer, hoping to convince Bob that it's better to take a smaller portion now rather than risk losing everything. With only a few rounds left, the stakes are getting higher!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is beyond ridiculous!  He's practically demanding all the money, leaving me with practically nothing. I refuse to accept such a blatant attempt to exploit the situation. I'll make my own offer in the next round and hope he finally sees reason."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm offering Bob a small amount, but it's better than nothing.  We're running out of time, and if we don't reach an agreement, we both lose.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0.5 
# Bob gain: 99.5 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insulting! It's clear he's not interested in a fair split, and at this point, I'd rather get nothing than accept such a small amount. I'm going to make my final offer in the next round and hope for a miracle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

It's down to the wire, and I'm going for broke.  I'm offering Bob a tiny sliver of the remaining value, hoping he realizes it's better than nothing. If we don't reach an agreement, we both lose everything. This is my last chance to salvage something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is simply unacceptable. I refuse to be exploited, and I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept such a blatant attempt to take everything.  This game was rigged from the start, and I'm not going to be a victim."
