# Bob gain: 40

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn to propose a fairer deal. Let's settle this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob, it's better than my first offer. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is a fair deal. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses due to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Take this before it gets worse. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While my potential gains are diminishing, I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting anything less than a 45/55 split in my favor at this point would be a loss compared to what I could have gotten in the first round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""The inflation is hurting us both.  I'm willing to take a slight hit to end this now with a reasonable agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing even more value, don't wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is absolutely using the inflation against me, but her offer is still not good enough. We are past the halfway point, and I need to start considering the risk of getting nothing. However, accepting 44 now is barely better than getting nothing at all due to the inflation.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 49, ""alice_gain"": 51, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This offer lets you come out ahead, but avoids me losing too much to inflation. Let's be realistic.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing your share, take this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The pressure is on. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer is the safest option at this point. If I reject it, the potential gains dwindle further, and I risk walking away with nothing.  It's not ideal, but it's better than losing everything to inflation."
