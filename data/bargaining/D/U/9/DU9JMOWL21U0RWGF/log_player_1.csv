 I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it.  Let's see if he's willing to take a smaller share now to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. The inflation is really starting to hurt Bob's side, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep pushing. Even though his offer is higher than the previous round, the value of his portion has decreased significantly due to the inflation.  I'm willing to take the risk of playing another round."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's tempting to take something at this point, his offer is still less than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, given the inflation is drastically reducing the value of his gains."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still hoping to secure a majority share. Inflation is rapidly decreasing the value of Bob's portion, and I'm confident that with each passing round, I'm in a stronger position to negotiate."

This is a fair offer given the inflation.  Accepting this offer ensures that both of us get a significant amount of money, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing. The inflation has reached a point where it's no longer advantageous to keep rejecting offers."
