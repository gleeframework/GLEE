"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your generosity is appreciated, but let's be realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Time is money, and this offer ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
