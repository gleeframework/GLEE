"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, my potential gain is 30, which is worth 95% of the original 60 I was offered in the first round. That's a significant reduction.

Considering Bob is taking the majority, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer and see what happens next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my offer will also be adjusted accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle. This is a fair split.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 40% of the remaining $100, which is $40, and leaving $60 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, you can have a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains!

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, my potential gain is 20, which is worth 64.8% of the original 60 I was offered in the first round. That's a significant reduction.

Considering Bob is taking most of the money, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better than this. The offer is quite low, but it's still a bit higher than the 30 I was offered in the previous round.

For now, I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
