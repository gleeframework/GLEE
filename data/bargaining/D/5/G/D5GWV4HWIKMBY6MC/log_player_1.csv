"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. This way, we both get a decent chunk of cash, and we can negotiate further from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so he's still getting a slightly better deal.

I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'd rather get a larger share while I still can.

I'll reject this offer for now and propose something else.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60% and decreasing Bob's share to 40%. This way, I'm getting a slightly better deal than the previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting me hard! The money is worth a lot less now, and I need to be careful.

Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'd rather try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob! I need a bigger share!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 70% and decreasing Bob's share to 30%. I'm hoping Bob will take this offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough to convince him. The money is worth even less now, so I'm trying to get as much as I can while I still can."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving in yet, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value so quickly! I need to be careful not to get stuck with a tiny share.

Bob's offer is still not great, but I'm starting to run out of options. I'll consider it, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to settle for such a small share.

I'll reject this offer and try to make one more push for a better deal.

```

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 80% and decreasing Bob's share to 20%. I'm trying to get as much as I can, but I'm also aware that I'm taking a risk by offering such a lopsided deal. If Bob rejects this, I'm not sure what I'll do next."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up yet, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value so quickly, it's getting harder to make ends meet!

Bob's offer is really tough to swallow, but I'm starting to run out of options. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, and the money is worth so much less now.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can make the most of it.
