"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm also leaving room for negotiations, hoping we can find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you have any concerns. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like the fact that Bob's gain is now 60% of the total amount, and it's worth the same as in the first round, while mine is worth 5% less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money for me. I'll aim to increase my share to compensate for the loss due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think this is a fair split""
}
