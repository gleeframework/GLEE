Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60:40 ratio is a more balanced approach, considering the inflation rates. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
