"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can negotiate further in the next rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750
* Bob gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750

Considering the offer, I'll accept it. It's a fair split, and we're meeting in the middle. Let's finalize the deal!

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
