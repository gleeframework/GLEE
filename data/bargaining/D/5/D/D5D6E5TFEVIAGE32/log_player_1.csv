I'm proposing to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. It's a pretty good deal for me, but I'm open to negotiation if he wants to keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
