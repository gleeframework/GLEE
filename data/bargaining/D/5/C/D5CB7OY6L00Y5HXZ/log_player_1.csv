"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Accept this and we can end it here! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, this offer is actually a better deal for me than the previous one. I'll accept this offer.
