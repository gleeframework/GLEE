"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose I take $60 and you take $40.  It's a good deal for you in the first round, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept a deal that gives Alice a larger share. Since the value of the money decreases much faster for Alice, there's a good chance she'll be more willing to compromise in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. I'm offering you a bit more than last time, but I need a larger share to account for the decreasing value of the money for me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you, but my losses are larger.  My offer is $55 for me and $45 for you. This is a compromise, taking both our positions into account. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, the inflation is hitting hard, and the potential gains from further rounds are diminishing. Accepting this offer secures a decent amount while minimizing potential losses."
