"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. This offer won't be as good next round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, remember that the money is worth less to her each round. By rejecting, I (Bob) get to make the proposal in the next round and potentially get a larger share.  Additionally, since the value of the money decreases for Alice, she might be more willing to accept a slightly less favorable offer to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Since you rejected my offer, I'm taking a slightly larger share. Let's end this now, or you'll lose even more value next round!"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  I'm losing value with each round, and this offer won't get any better for me. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's a good outcome considering the circumstances.  Alice is losing more value each round, and it's likely she won't offer more than 50% in the future. Accepting guarantees me a decent share of the money, while rejecting risks getting less in future rounds."
