Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  Since this is the first round, I'm giving Bob a small share to see if he's willing to accept a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept Bob's offer.  While I'm getting less than I wanted in the first round, the inflation makes it clear that I need to accept this offer before it gets even worse."
