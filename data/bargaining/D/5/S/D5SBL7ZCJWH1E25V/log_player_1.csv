"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is 55/45 in my favor.  This recognizes your initial offer but also accounts for the fact that we both lose money with each round. Let's work together to get something before the value drops too much. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
