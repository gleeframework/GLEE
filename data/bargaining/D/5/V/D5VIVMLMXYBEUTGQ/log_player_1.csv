"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $600,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation impacts us differently. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're just mirroring my first offer, I'd like to see a more creative solution""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's essentially the same as my first proposal, just with the labels flipped. I'd like to see a more innovative solution that takes into account the different inflation rates affecting our gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on a 55/45 split, considering the inflation impact on our gains""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, taking 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $550,000, and leaving Bob with 45%, or $450,000. My message is a compromise, acknowledging the different inflation rates and suggesting a middle ground."
