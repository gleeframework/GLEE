"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While the offer seems tempting, the risk of inflation makes it unwise to accept in the first round.  There's a chance to get a better deal later."
