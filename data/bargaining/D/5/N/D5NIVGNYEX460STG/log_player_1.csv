"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the million!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split.  Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $360,000 (10% less than the original $400,000).

I'm not sure I like the fact that Bob is getting a larger share, but I'm also eager to end the game quickly. Let's see...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```"
