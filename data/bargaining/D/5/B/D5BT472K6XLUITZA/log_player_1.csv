"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering you $30, and I'll take the remaining $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly!

I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the further decrease in value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to get a better deal this time."
