# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too.  This offer is still generous to you.

# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a compromise. I'm taking a slight hit due to inflation, but it's more than fair for you. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is significantly impacting the value of his potential gains. While his offer isn't terrible, I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
