**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting worse for her due to inflation, but they are still heavily skewed in her favor.  We're past the halfway point, and it's time to start pushing for a more favorable outcome. The risk of getting nothing is becoming very real for Alice, so she may be more open to a less imbalanced offer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - it's a fair split and gives us both a good deal. Let's close this out and avoid going home empty-handed.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing significantly with each round. 
* **Shifting power dynamic:** Inflation is eroding Alice's potential gains faster than mine. She's likely feeling the pressure.
* **Firm but fair:** Offering a slight advantage to me (51/49 split) is justifiable given the circumstances and still presents a significantly better outcome for Alice than she's been proposing.
* **Finality:**  By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to add a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept before the potential gains dwindle further."
