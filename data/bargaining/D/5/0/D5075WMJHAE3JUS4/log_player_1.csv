"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."

# Bob's message: Let's try again, I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 50/50 is a good deal for me, considering the money is worth less now. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better share this time.""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better share, but I think 55 is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

I think 45% is a decent share considering the reduced value of the money. I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and end the game."
