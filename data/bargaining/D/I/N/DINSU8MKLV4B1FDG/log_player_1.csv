# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm thinking... Bob's offer is better for him now, but it's still not great for me even with the inflation. I'll take a risk and see if I can get a better deal.

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is tricky. He's offering the same split as round 1, but inflation has hit him much harder. While I could push for more, there's a real risk he'll keep getting less and less interested in a deal that benefits me.  I'll play it safe.
