Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money evenly this time, considering the inflation we both face.  It's a fair and simple solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept the offer since the even split seems fair, especially considering the impact of inflation on both of our gains."
