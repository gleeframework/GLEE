"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you 20% and keep 80% for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you half, let's call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to be generous, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

After calculating the effective value of the money, I'll have to accept this offer. The 500,000$ I'll get is worth less than the 800,000$ I would have gotten in the first round, but it's still a decent offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
