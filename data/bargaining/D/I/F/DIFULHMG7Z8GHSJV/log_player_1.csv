"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, Alice.  Let's get this done before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to consider the value of the offer in terms of the reduced amount.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 95% of the original $400,000, or $380,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer yet. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more aggressive now, Bob. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is worth 30% of the original $1,000,000. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's try to be reasonable.  This offer is better for both of us than letting the money continue to shrink in value. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me now, I'll have to consider the value of the offer in terms of the reduced amount.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 85.74% of the original $350,000 (not the original $1,000,000, since the offer is not the full amount). 

However, considering the offer is for $300,000, which is worth 30% of the original $1,000,000, I'll calculate the value as 30% of the original $1,000,000, which is $300,000, and then apply the 14.26% reduction, making the value $257,490.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer yet. I'll reject it for now.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more aggressive again, Bob. I think I deserve more of the remaining value.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is worth 45% of the original $1,000,000, and I'll get $550,000, which is worth 55% of the original $1,000,000. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can proceed to the next round."
