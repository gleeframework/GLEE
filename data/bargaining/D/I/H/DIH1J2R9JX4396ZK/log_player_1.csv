"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. With that in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer:

Alice gain: 70
Bob gain: 30

Hmm... I'm not thrilled about giving up 30 dollars, but I'm also not eager to go to the next round and risk losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to...
