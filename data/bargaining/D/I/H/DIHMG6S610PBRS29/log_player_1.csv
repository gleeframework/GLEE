Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly. I'll keep 90% for myself and give Bob 10%.  Let's see if he's happy with that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and since inflation is kicking in, it's better to take a guaranteed 50% now rather than risk getting less later."
