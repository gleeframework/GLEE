"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but my turn comes with a price due to inflation. Let's be reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous, take it before it devalues further 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, her offer is barely budging. It's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a better deal before the money shrinks significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and the money is literally shrinking. My offer is more than fair considering the inflation we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me more, I won't go lower, decide wisely 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is starting to become a significant factor.  While not ideal, getting $45 now is better than risking getting a worse deal later as the value diminishes further.  Alice seems firm, and waiting might leave me with even less in the end."
