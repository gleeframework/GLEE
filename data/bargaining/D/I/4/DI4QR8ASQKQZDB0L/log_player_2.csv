Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of an even split, but it's crucial to factor in the faster depreciation I face.  This offer is a compromise, tilting slightly more in my favor to account for the time-sensitive nature of the situation. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
