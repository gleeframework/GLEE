"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I'm trying to make a fair offer to see if Bob will accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Think about it! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a relatively good deal, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round. I'm hoping to get an even better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You've been playing hard to get, Bob. I'm making a stronger move this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving in yet. I'll try to squeeze out a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I need to be careful. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I'm not sure if I should push for more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. 75% of the money is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower potential gains."
