"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering you 30 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping you'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, my gain of 70 dollars from Round 1 is still 70 dollars, but for Bob, his gain of 30 dollars from Round 1 is now worth 27 dollars (since it's 10% less).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll accept it. I'll take the 60 dollars and we can end the game.
