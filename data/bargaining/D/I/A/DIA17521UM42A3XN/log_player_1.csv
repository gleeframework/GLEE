Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for the majority of the money.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit much. While I'm not averse to taking a smaller share, this is a huge swing in the opposite direction.  I'll make my own counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to propose a more balanced split.  Hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer, as we're nearing the halfway point of the game and the money is rapidly decreasing in value."
