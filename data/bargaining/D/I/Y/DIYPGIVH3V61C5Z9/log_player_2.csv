Alice's offer:

Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split in my favor is a more equitable starting point, considering the inflation effect. We can continue negotiating, but this reflects our respective losses in value with each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise.  Since you're gaining more value each round, I'm willing to move closer to your initial proposal.  I'm offering 4750 for me, and 5250 for you. Let's wrap this up before the inflation eats away too much more of my share. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
