"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid wasting time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so $400,000 is equivalent to $384,615.60 in the previous round's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
