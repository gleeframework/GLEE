"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is 30% of the original $100. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can negotiate further in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $60 is now worth 90% of the original $70, which is $63. So, in terms of purchasing power, I'm actually getting a bit less than I initially proposed.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not getting as much as I initially wanted, but it's a slightly better deal than the first round. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll aim to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, Bob! I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $44, which is 44% of the current $100 value. This way, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, Alice. Let's just split it evenly this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is a big jump from his previous one! With inflation, the money is worth 72.9% of its original value, so I'd be getting $72.9 if I accepted this offer.

Considering the current state of the game, I think this is a decent compromise. Splitting it evenly seems fair, and it's a good opportunity to end the game on a relatively good note.
