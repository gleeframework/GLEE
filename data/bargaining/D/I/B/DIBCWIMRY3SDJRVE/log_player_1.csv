"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split just yet. I was hoping for a better deal, considering I was willing to start with a 60-40 split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 45-55 split. I was hoping for a better deal, especially considering the money I gain is worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer. At this point, I'm getting a bit desperate too, and 60-40 is a decent compromise. I'm not thrilled about it, but I think it's a fair deal considering the inflation and the rounds that have passed. Let's finalize the split!"
