I'm going to try to be fair, but also get a good chunk of the money.  I'm proposing 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm not sure what's going on with the inflation, but Bob seems to be taking a big hit from it. I'll try to use this to my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to try to be a bit more aggressive this time, knowing Bob is likely hurting from the inflation. 850,000 for me, 150,000 for Bob.  Let's see if this is more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer.  Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, but I think I can still do better.  I'm going to keep pushing for a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 200,000 and keep 800,000 for myself. Bob is clearly hurting from inflation, and I need to maximize my gains before it impacts me too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much better offer than the previous one, and I'm starting to feel the pinch of the inflation.  While I'd love to keep pushing for more, I'm going to accept this 50/50 split and secure some of the money before it's worth even less."
