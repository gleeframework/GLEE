"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering I'm the first to propose.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most rational choice. My share is significantly reduced due to inflation, and it's unlikely I can get a better deal in the next round.  It's better to secure 75% now than risk getting nothing later."
