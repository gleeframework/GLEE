Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a tiny bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing me:** My potential gains are eroding rapidly with each round. 
* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's consistently offered deals favoring herself and seems content to wait me out.
* **Something is better than nothing:** If I reject this offer and she offers me even less next round (which is likely), I'll be kicking myself. 

While not ideal, taking $43 (worth much less in ""real"" value due to the rounds passed) is better than risking getting an even worse deal or nothing at all in later rounds."
