"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! 60/40 in my favor this time. We can both get a little more than last round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, my gain of $40 is actually worth $38.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but it's a slight improvement over the previous round. I'll accept this offer.
