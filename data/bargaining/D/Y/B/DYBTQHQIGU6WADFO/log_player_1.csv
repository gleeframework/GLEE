"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm going for a very aggressive strategy here.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm assuming it doesn't affect him at all.  This means I can take almost everything in the first round and still be in a good position if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's a significant gain, I know I can do better.  Inflation is working in my favor, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm again going for a high offer, aiming for 90% of the money. I know that inflation is making each round more favorable to me, and I want to maximize my gains while still leaving Bob with a small incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  Although inflation is significantly affecting Bob, I'm in a strong position due to the fact that I know the impact of inflation on me, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller portion, aiming for 95% of the money. Inflation is heavily affecting Bob, and I'm playing a strategic game of brinkmanship.  If he rejects, he'll be losing even more due to inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering a significant portion, I'm still going to reject.  Inflation is working heavily in my favor, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round.  He's losing a lot of value with each passing round, and I'm not willing to settle for less than 90% at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 975000, ""bob_gain"": 25000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, aiming for 97.5% of the money. Bob is losing a significant amount due to inflation, and I'm playing a game of attrition. He's likely feeling the pressure and might be more inclined to accept a smaller share than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 850000 
# Bob gain: 150000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  Even though inflation is heavily impacting him, I'm in a strong position and can likely get a better deal. I'm sticking to my strategy of aiming for a high percentage and hoping that the pressure of diminishing returns will force Bob to accept a smaller share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, aiming for 99% of the money. This is my final push before the game ends. With inflation hitting Bob hard, he's probably desperate for any gain at all.  If he rejects, we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 925000 
# Bob gain: 75000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Although inflation is heavily impacting him, I'm holding out for a bigger share. We're in the final rounds, and I believe I can still secure a better deal. The pressure is mounting, but I'm confident I can get 95% or more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

It's down to the wire!  I'm going for a near-complete take, leaving Bob only $1000.  At this point, inflation has likely crippled Bob's bargaining power.  He has to accept *something*, or we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 950000 
# Bob gain: 50000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a close call, but I'm accepting Bob's offer.  He's offering a significant amount, and it's better than getting nothing.  With just one round left, the risk of getting nothing is too high.  I'm taking the 950,000 and ending the game."
