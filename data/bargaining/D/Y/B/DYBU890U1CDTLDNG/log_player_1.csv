I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the offer. I was hoping for a better share, especially considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."

Ugh, Bob's getting greedy! I'm not happy with the 1,000 to 9,000 split. Considering the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I think I deserve a better deal. I'll reject this offer and hope Bob will come back with a more reasonable proposal."
