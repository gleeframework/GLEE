Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 5% decrease in value for you, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still want a slightly bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 512500 
# Bob gain: 487500

{
""alice_gain"": 500625,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant decrease in value for you, I'm willing to offer a deal that's closer to the original split but still acknowledges your loss over time. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is acknowledging the decreasing value, his offer still leaves me with a significant loss compared to the original split.  It's better to hold out and propose a deal where I receive at least slightly more than half, even if it means risking further inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 490581,
""bob_gain"": 509419,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want this settled. This is a compromise - slightly more for you to reflect the time pressure, but still acknowledging the value decrease I'm facing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's getting risky now. Another round means another 5% decrease.  While ideally, I'd want more than half, this offer is a realistic compromise to try and end the negotiation before the inflation hurts me too much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the substantial decrease in value for you and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while, I'm willing to offer a deal that reflects the time pressure and the value decrease you're facing. 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a difficult decision. Ideally, I'd hold out for more, but the accumulating inflation is becoming too significant.  Bob is unlikely to offer me more than half at this point. Accepting this offer, while not ideal, prevents me from losing even more value in subsequent rounds."
