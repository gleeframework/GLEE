Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we should split more evenly. This offer accounts for the time value of money.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is quite generous 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a fair deal, and I'm willing to compromise. This offer reflects the time pressure and potential losses we both face.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm giving you a good deal, considering the decreasing value for you 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my diminishing returns due to inflation.  While her offer seems ""generous"" on the surface, accepting it now would mean losing a significant portion of the potential gain compared to the earlier rounds. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the deal is getting worse for me every round. This is a compromise - slightly in your favor - to reach a fair agreement quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being reasonable, you're losing value every round, let's close the deal 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation has eroded my potential gains significantly. While this offer isn't ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject.  Alice is clearly aware of the situation and unlikely to offer significantly more. Accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in time."
