"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. It's a simple and fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, let's negotiate more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50% difference in our proposed shares, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to improve my share in the next round.
