"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the lion's share of the money. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'll take 60% this time, and you can keep the remaining 40%. This is a fair compromise, let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a good start to the negotiations!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Hmm... I don't want to give up 60% of the money, but I also don't want to go to a third round and risk losing even more value due to inflation. I'll have to think of a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% bite out of my potential earnings, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal. 55% for me, 45% for you. This is my final offer for now.""
}
```"
