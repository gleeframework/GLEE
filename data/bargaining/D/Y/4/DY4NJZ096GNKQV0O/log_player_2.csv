I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept such a low offer on the first round!  I'll take my chances with making my own proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 50/50 split. This seems like the fairest way to start, and it gives us both a good foundation to work with."
