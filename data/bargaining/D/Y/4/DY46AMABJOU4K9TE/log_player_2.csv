Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nSince the money is worth 10% less for Alice in the next round, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll try to offer a slightly better deal for myself, considering the inflation.\n\n###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's meet in the middle.  This offer accounts for the inflation and allows us both to gain something. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nSince the money is still worth the same for me, I can try to negotiate for an even better deal. The inflation is affecting Alice's gain more, so I'll see if I can take advantage of that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nConsidering the increasing effect of inflation on Alice's gain, I'll try to offer a deal that's slightly more favorable to me.\n\n###\n{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""I think this split is more reasonable, given the current inflation.""}"
