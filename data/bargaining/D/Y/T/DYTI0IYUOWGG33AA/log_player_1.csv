Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to ensure we both get a good share before the value decreases. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than your last offer. Let's meet in the middle to secure a fair outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is compromising, the deal is still not favorable enough considering the inflation working against him.  I'm aiming to secure at least 65% of the money, and I'm willing to push closer to the later rounds if necessary to gain a stronger bargaining position."
