"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is more fair, considering the inflation risk we both face. It's a better deal for you than last round and still leaves me with a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
