"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In the first round, I offered Bob $400,000, which is now worth 95% of its original value due to inflation. So, the equivalent value of my original offer in the second round is $380,000.

Considering Bob's offer of $300,000 for me and $700,000 for him, I'll reject this offer since I'd be giving up $80,000 more than my original offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $580,000 and keep $420,000 for myself."
