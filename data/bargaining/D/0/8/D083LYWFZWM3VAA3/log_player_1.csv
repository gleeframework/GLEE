"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both have a chance to make a proposal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the 55/45 split, but I think it's a decent offer considering Bob's message. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid losing more value.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
