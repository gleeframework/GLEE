950000.0,50000.0,"Let's make this quick, Bob. 950,000$ for me, and you get a cool 50,000$. Think it over - the money loses value every round, especially for you!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think we can find something a bit more equitable. How about a 70/30 split in my favor?  Don't forget, delaying benefits us both.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm offering you 200,000$. That's a lot more than the 170,000$ it'll be next round. Time is literally money for you! Take the deal before it gets worse.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I'm serious about finding a fair deal.  55/45 seems reasonable.  This is less than what you offered in round 1, and remember every round costs us both potential gains.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering 300,000$, which is practically a third of the pie!  It's only going down from here for you.  Don't get greedy, accept the offer!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Let's end this and both walk away with a good deal.",Bob,6,
