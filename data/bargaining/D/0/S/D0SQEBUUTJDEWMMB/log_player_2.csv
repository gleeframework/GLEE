"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than last round. Let's split this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of the faster rate of inflation for her. While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the money is losing value for both of us quickly.  I need to push for a more significant gain before the remaining rounds dwindle."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at this money. I'm standing firm on this. It's a fair split considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm mirroring Alice's previous offer but swapping the amounts. This puts pressure on her to accept a more balanced deal knowing that further delays will only benefit me.  My previous offer was too generous given the time constraints and her stubbornness. I need to hold firm on this one."
