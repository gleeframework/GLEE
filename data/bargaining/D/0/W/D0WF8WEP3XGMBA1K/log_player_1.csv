Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is really taking its toll on your share now. I'll take an even larger portion this time, but it's still better than getting nothing 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
At this point, even though the offer is far from ideal, it's better to accept and get something than risk getting nothing. Inflation is heavily impacting Alice's gains, and continuing to reject offers might lead to a situation where both players get nothing."
