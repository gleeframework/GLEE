I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself, especially considering the risk of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a more balanced split is possible, with 600,000 for me and 400,000 for you. This way, we both benefit from a fair share while acknowledging the potential of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the risk of inflation, I propose an equal division of the money, with each of us receiving $500000. This ensures fairness and reduces the impact of potential loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Considering the inflation, an equal split is a fair outcome.  It's better than risking losing more money by continuing to negotiate."
