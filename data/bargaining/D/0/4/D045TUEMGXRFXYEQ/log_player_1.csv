"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not being too generous just yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, my gain of $6,000 in this round is equivalent to $8,000 in the first round, which is less than my initial offer. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% reduction in value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""You're not being too generous, so I'll try to meet you halfway. Accept and we can move forward!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to being generous, but I still want to keep a slight edge. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $5,000 in this round is equivalent to $9,821.38 in the first round. This is a significant reduction in value, and I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

However, I also consider that Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which is a more even split than my previous offer. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds.
