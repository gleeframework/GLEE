Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm hoping to get the most I can right away.  Even if he rejects, I'll have the next turn and can adjust my offer based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this is a significant improvement from the first round and I'm not sure how much better I can do.  The inflation doesn't affect my gains, so this is a good deal for me."
