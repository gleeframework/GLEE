"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, I'm willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Rejecting this offer gives Bob the chance to propose a deal that's more favorable to him, especially considering the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I believe this is a fair deal considering the potential for inflation. Let's get this done.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even with inflation, a 4500/5500 split is still not ideal for Bob.  By continuing to reject, he can potentially push Alice to a more favorable deal in the next round.  There's still time to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair share with the inflation factor in mind.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and split it 50/50. Let's make a deal 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While a 50/50 split isn't perfect, the inflation is taking a serious toll. Accepting this offer secures a decent amount of money for Bob, and with only 7 rounds left, the potential for a better deal becomes increasingly risky."
