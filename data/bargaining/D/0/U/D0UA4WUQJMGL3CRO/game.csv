450000.0,550000.0,"I understand you want a larger share due to inflation, but that offer is too low for me. How about a split that acknowledges the decreasing value but is still beneficial for both of us?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Considering the inflation, my share should be higher. This is a more reasonable split.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and every round costs us both. I'm proposing a simple, fair 50/50 split. It benefits us both equally and avoids further losses due to inflation. ",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
570000.0,430000.0,"A 50/50 split doesn't account for inflation. This offer is more realistic, considering the decreasing value for you.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose if this goes on much longer. I'm offering you a larger share than I'll get. Accept this, and we both walk away with something.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"I understand your frustration, but I'm not going to settle for less. Inflation is on my side. This is my revised offer.",Alice,7,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. You're being incredibly unreasonable. I'm making one last offer - a 60/40 split in my favor. Take it or leave it. We're running out of time, and I'm done playing games.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"You're getting desperate, but I'm not backing down. This is my offer. Take it or we'll keep playing.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"This is it, Alice.  My final offer: 50/50. You've wasted both our time with your greed, but I believe in fairness until the very end.  Accept this, or we both get nothing.  The clock is ticking.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
540000.0,460000.0,"I've come this far, and I won't settle for 50/50. This is my final serious offer. Take it or risk losing everything.",Alice,11,
