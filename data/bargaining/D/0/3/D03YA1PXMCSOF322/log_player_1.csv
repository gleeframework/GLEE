"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a small share for now, but be prepared for a bigger ask later.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the start, Alice. This offer aims for a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next proposal.

I reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make my next offer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob! I'm taking a bigger share now, but still leaving you with a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm pushing for a larger share, but still giving Bob a substantial amount, considering the diminishing value of money."
