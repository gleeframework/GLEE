"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I understand Bob's point about the different inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. I think I can get a better split considering the initial offer I made."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 70-30 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation rates. Let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob considering the inflation rates. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
