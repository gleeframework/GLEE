I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure the money quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is much less generous than mine, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share this round, but I'm still aiming for a larger portion. Hopefully, he sees that this is a good deal for both of us."
