"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 20% of the initial amount. Accept and we can split the remaining 80% equally.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the remaining amount after Bob accepts, and we'll divide the remaining 20% equally in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% of the initial amount. If you accept, we can split the remaining 60% equally. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400000 * 0.8 = 320000
* Bob gain: 600000 * 0.8 = 480000

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
