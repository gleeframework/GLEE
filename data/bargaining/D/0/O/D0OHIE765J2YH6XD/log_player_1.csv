"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to meet in the middle, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me. Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $360,000 (90% of $400,000) in real terms, while Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth $480,000 (80% of $600,000).

I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal, so I'll reject the offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to maximize my share while still leaving Bob with a decent amount. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! The value of the money is dropping fast!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it before the value of the money drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not going to let you steal the deal! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has dropped significantly! My gain of $580,000 is now worth $422,600 (71.9% of $580,000) in real terms, while Bob's gain of $420,000 is worth $208,400 (49.5% of $420,000).
