"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it closer to even. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

* My gain: 45 * 0.9 (10% less) = 40.5
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.95 (5% less) = 52.25

I'll reject this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. Let's call it a draw.""
}
```

This offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise."
