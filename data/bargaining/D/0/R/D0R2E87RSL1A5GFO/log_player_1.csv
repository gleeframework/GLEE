"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose taking almost all of the money, leaving Bob with a symbolic $1. Since the money inflates for me and not for Bob, I want to maximize my share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation would make any future rounds less favorable for me, and Bob is unlikely to offer me more in the future."
