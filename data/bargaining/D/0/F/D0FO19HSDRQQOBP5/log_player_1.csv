"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fairer split, considering we both need to make a living.  Let's get this done and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
