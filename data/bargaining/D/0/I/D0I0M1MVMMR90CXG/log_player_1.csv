"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm keeping the majority 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the small share, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite one-sided, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still keeping a decent chunk for myself""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise!"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still being generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! Despite Bob's claim of being generous, I'm not thrilled about the offer. However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.
