"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  50/50 split seems like the most sensible way to begin. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise to avoid losing value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60/40 is a reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, so I'm offering her a slightly smaller share in the hopes that she'll accept before the value decreases further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, but I'm willing to compromise.  45/55 seems like a fair middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice is compromising, I still think I can get a better offer. The money is worth 36% less for her now, so she may be more desperate to reach an agreement before it loses even more value. I'll wait for the next round to see if she's willing to give me an even larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""The value of the money keeps dropping for you, so I think 65/35 is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm continuing to try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for Alice with each passing round. Since she's already compromised once, I'm hoping she'll be willing to accept an even smaller share to avoid losing more value."
