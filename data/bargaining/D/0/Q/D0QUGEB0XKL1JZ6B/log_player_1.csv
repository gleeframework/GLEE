"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for haggling!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving Bob a 40% share, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round with the value of the money decreasing further. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
