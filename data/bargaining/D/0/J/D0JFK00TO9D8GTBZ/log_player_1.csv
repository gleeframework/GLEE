"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is a fair compromise given the risk of inflation.  This ensures we both receive a significant portion while accounting for the potential losses. Let's reach a deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
