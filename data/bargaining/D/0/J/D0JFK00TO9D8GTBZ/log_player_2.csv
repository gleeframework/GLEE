"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio, giving you 250000$ and myself 750000$. Considering the risk of inflation, this seems like a fair offer. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is a tempting starting point, there's a lot of money at stake, and with the risk of inflation, it's worth pushing for a more favorable deal.  I'll see if I can get a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
