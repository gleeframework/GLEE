"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and take the biggest parts! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal. I'll reject and see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this round! I'll take a larger share, but you'll still get a significant amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. This way we both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is a good compromise. While the money is worth less due to inflation, it's better to accept and secure a decent amount than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
