"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you 40%!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, 50/50 split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative value of the amounts. In this round, the total value of the money is worth 90% of the original $10,000.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which means I would get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000. However, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money is less.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50/50 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll offer a slightly lower amount to Bob, while keeping a larger share for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a better deal!""
}
```

This way, I'm keeping a slightly larger share, but still giving Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I want a better deal too! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is worth 72.2% of the original $10,000.

Bob's new offer is $5200 for me and $4800 for him. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to take into account the relative value of the amounts.

I'll calculate the actual value of the money I'd get in this offer:

$5200 * 0.727 (72.2% of the original value) ≈ $3776

Compared to my original offer in round 1, where I would get $6000 * 0.727 ≈ $4368, this offer is less favorable to me.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself, considering the inflation and the previous offers. I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I want a fair deal too! 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is worth 61.77% of the original $10,000.

Bob's new offer is $4900 for me and $5100 for him. I'll calculate the actual value of the money I'd get in this offer:

$4900 * 0.619 (61.7% of the original value) ≈ $3031

Compared to my original offer in round 1, where I would get $6000 * 0.619 ≈ $3714, this offer is less favorable to me.

However, considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll take this offer. It's not ideal, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better deal, and I think this is the best option given the circumstances.
