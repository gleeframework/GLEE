"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money into $7500 for me and $2500 for you. This gives us both a fair share while considering the decreasing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  While I understand the decreasing value of money for me, I believe this is a fair compromise considering the potential for even greater losses in the future. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
