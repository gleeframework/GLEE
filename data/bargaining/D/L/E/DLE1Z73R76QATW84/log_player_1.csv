"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is worth 20% less than what I would have gotten in the first round, I'm actually getting a smaller share than I would have liked. However, I don't want to give up too much, so I'll consider Bob's offer.

I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
