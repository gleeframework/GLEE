"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too keen on splitting it evenly, as I'd like to keep more of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather not split it 50-50, I'll make a new offer""
}
```

Your turn again, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to make a slightly more advantageous offer for myself. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% this time, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

Your turn again, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split given the inflation.  Let's end this game and get on with our lives. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more advantageous offer this time around. However, I'm not convinced that 60-40 is a good deal for me, considering the inflation.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather not give you 60% of the money, I'll make a new offer""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet. Your turn again, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, I'll try to make an offer that takes that into account. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think 70% is a fair compromise""
}
```

Your turn again, Bob!"
