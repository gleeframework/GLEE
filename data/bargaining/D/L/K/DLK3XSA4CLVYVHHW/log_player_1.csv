"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$, which is 40$. This leaves me with 60$. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer or accept my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a strong start, but willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of 20$ in this round is equivalent to 18$ in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
