Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure a large initial offer will be appealing to Bob, and I can adjust in later rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt. A 450,000 gain is still significant, and I don't want to risk getting less in future rounds."
