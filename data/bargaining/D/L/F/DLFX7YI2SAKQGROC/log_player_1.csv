"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going to be greedy and propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since this is the first round, I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll be ready to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is very lopsided in Bob's favor, I'm going to accept it. The money is losing value quickly due to inflation, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round.  It's better to take something than nothing!"
