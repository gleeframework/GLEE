Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more than you. I'm offering you 45 which is more than you would've gotten last round.  It's a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
