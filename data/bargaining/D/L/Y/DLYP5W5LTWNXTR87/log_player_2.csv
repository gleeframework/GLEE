"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a more balanced split. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's less risky than holding out for more. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000
