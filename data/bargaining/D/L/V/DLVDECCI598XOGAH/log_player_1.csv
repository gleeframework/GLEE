"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, a fair and balanced start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $4800 (60% of the new total). Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'd be getting $4750.

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my gain, but I think 50-50 is a fair offer. I'll accept it.
