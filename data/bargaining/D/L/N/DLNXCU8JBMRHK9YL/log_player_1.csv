"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $1,000,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that we be reasonable and accept this offer to avoid losing value due to inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome. This offer considers the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer to divide the $1,000,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""

```

I've taken into account the fact that the money is now worth 10% less than in the first round, and 1% less than the amount in the last round, and I'm offering to take 57% of the money, leaving Bob with 43%. My message to Bob suggests meeting in the middle of our previous offers, trying to find a mutually acceptable compromise. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
