"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

In this round, the total amount of money is still $100, but it's worth less to me due to inflation. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $40, which is equivalent to 40% of the original amount, but it's actually worth 32% of the original amount due to inflation.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I should aim for a higher share to compensate for the inflation. However, Bob's offer is still a significant improvement over my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
