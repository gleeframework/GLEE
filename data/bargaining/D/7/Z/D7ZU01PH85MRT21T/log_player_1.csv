"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20 for a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20%, which is $20. I'm framing this as a fair starting point for the negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $50 is now worth 20% less than the original $80, so it's equivalent to $64.

I'm willing to accept this offer since it's a more even split than my initial proposal. I'll take the $50 and call it a day.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
