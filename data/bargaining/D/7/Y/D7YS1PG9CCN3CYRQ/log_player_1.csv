"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to keep more for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rates.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a more even split.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with an even better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round, the total amount of money is now effectively $9,000 (10,000 / 1.1) for me and $9,500 (10,000 / 1.05) for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more this round.""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle this time, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Looks like we finally met in the middle, Bob! I'll take 5,000 and call it a day.""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Thanks for playing the game with me, Bob!"
