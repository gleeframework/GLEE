"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because it seems extremely unfair to me. I would get only $10,000 out of $1,000,000, which is a tiny fraction. I believe I can get a better deal if I proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a more reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I want to try to end the game quickly while still getting a fair share. I'll offer Alice a significant amount, but also keep a substantial portion for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Let's split it in a more reasonable way. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a good starting point.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more equitable split.  Let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, the actual value of what I would gain is significantly less than what it appears to be. The offer might seem closer to being fair in nominal terms, but in real terms, I'm losing value with each passing round. I believe making another counteroffer could potentially give me a better outcome.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","In this round, I'll take into account the increasing effect of inflation on my potential gain. Since the money is worth even less to me now, I need to adjust my strategy to try and conclude the game as soon as possible while still aiming for a relatively fair split. Given that Alice has shown some willingness to compromise, I'll make an offer that slightly adjusts the proportions in her favor compared to my previous offer, hoping it will be acceptable to her.

{""bob_gain"": 350000,
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to compromise further to reach an agreement sooner. I hope this offer is more to your liking.""}"
