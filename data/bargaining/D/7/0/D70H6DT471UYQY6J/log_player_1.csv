"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting with a slightly biased split. Accept and we can finish the game! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob this round, I'll think about the value in terms of the original $100.

The proposed split is 40-60, which is even more biased towards Bob than the previous round. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You started with a biased offer, so I'm adjusting the split. Accept and we can finish the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You adjusted the split, now I'm adjusting it back. Accept and we can finish the game! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to drive the split back to his favor.

Since the money is worth 14.26% less for Bob this round, I'll consider the value in terms of the original $100. The proposed split is 45-55, which is still slightly biased towards Bob.

I'll think about it for a moment...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to counter with an even more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle. Let's end the game with a fair split!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
