"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split. Let's start with a more even distribution. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm not ready to give up yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 50-50 for now?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a middle ground."
