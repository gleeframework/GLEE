"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, there's no reason to accept in the first round. There's a good chance I can get a better deal in later rounds, especially considering the inflation that affects Alice more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's switch it up this round. I'll take a little more, but we can work out a better deal later if you're willing to negotiate.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is slowly increasing her share, but I'm getting more than I would have if I'd accepted her initial offer.  It's a good compromise and  I don't want to risk losing even more due to inflation if I keep rejecting offers."
