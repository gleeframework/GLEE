"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 99, and you can have 1. This is a fair deal considering the inflation risk!  ðŸ˜‰ 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, 99/1 is a pretty one-sided deal! But I'm not sure if I can do better. Given the inflation risk, I'd rather take the 1$ and be done with it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
