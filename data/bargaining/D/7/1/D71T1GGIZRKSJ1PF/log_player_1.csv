"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in Round 2, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll receive in this round. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 400,000 dollars, which is equivalent to 500,000 / 0.8 = 625,000 dollars in Round 1 terms.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
