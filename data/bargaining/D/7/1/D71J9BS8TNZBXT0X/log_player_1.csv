"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

This way, we both get a fair share, and we can see how the game plays out from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less this round, but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so I might be able to get a better deal by waiting.

I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn again. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this round, but I'm not getting any younger. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share now and leaving room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting me hard! With the money worth 14.26% less than the original, I need to be careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 35. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 57.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and inflation is eating away at my share. Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share now and leaving room for negotiation in future rounds."
