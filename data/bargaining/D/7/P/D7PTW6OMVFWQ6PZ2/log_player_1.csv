"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money and can still have a chance to negotiate further if we want to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is better. Let's go for 55/45, giving me a slight advantage. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, I'd rather have a bit more money now rather than risking it might be worth even less in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
