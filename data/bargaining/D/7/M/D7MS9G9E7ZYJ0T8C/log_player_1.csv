"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can wrap up the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $300,000 x 0.9 = $270,000
Bob gain: $700,000 x 0.9 = $630,000

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's still a decent deal. I'll accept it.
