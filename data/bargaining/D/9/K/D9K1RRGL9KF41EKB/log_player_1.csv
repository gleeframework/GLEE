"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going for a very aggressive opening offer, leaving Bob with only $1000.  This might seem unfair, but remember, the money is worth 20% less each round for me, and only 5% less for Bob. I need to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, especially considering the inflation rates. I'm not going to accept that. I'll take my chances and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob 100,000 this round.  While I still want to secure the majority, the inflation is starting to hit hard. I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and ensuring we both get something before the money becomes completely worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, especially considering the significant inflation impact on my earnings. I need to push for a more equitable deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a much larger share this round.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and I need to make a compromise to avoid getting nothing. 700,000 is still a significant amount, and I believe Bob will be more inclined to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting very close to the end, and the inflation is severely impacting my earnings.  While Bob's offer is not ideal, it's the best I can get right now. If I reject it, I risk getting nothing. It's time to take the deal and secure something before it's too late."
