"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain.

I'll think carefully before responding to Bob's offer. Since I'm worth 5% less than before, I'll consider that when making my decision.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm still not giving up too much!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain!

Considering the offer, I think I should be more cautious since my gain is worth less than before. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up 65% of the remaining money.

After thinking about it, I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, and I don't want to give up too much more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 38,
  ""bob_gain"": 62,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much more!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a fair share and not giving up too much to Bob."
