"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll consider the effective gains in this round.

For me, the offer is 40 * 0.9 = 36
For Bob, the offer is 60 * 1 = 60

I'll accept this offer since I'm getting more than half of the remaining amount.
