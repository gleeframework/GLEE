I'm offering Bob $1000 and keeping $999,000 for myself. Since it's the first round, I want to secure a large majority of the money.  However, I'm leaving Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, offering me a significantly smaller share than I offered him in the first round.  I'm going to reject and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10 times more than he offered me in the previous round. This should be enough to incentivize him to accept. It's a compromise, but it still leaves me with a significant share of the money."
