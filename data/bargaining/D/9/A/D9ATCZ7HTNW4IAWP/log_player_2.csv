"Round 1

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than that. This offer is still good for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Think carefully before rejecting it. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's end this and split it evenly. With inflation increasing, any further delays will only hurt both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than last time, but I'm not going to split it evenly. The inflation is affecting you more than me, so I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the impact of inflation is becoming severe. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, accepting a 43/57 split is better than risking another rejection. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  If I reject this offer and propose a 50/50 split again in Round 6, even if Alice accepts, the inflation will have eroded the value of my share. It's unlikely I can secure a significantly better deal than 43% at this stage.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice seems to understand the advantage she has with the inflation working in her favor.  She's unlikely to agree to an even split, and her offers might get progressively worse for me.

It's a tough decision, but sometimes accepting a less-than-ideal offer is the best strategic move in a negotiation."
