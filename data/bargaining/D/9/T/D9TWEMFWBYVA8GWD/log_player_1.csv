I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as it reflects a significant advantage for me, but also gives Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. While I am willing to concede some of my initial advantage, I believe this offer is still fair considering the potential for further inflation and the fact that I was the one to make the first offer."
