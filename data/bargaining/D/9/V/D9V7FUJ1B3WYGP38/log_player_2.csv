**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to play hardball, but she's also losing value quickly.  While this offer is better than her last, she's running out of time and I think I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Look, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is fair and we both lose if this keeps dragging on.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is starting to become a significant factor.  Offering a 50/50 split seems like the best move now to ensure we both get a decent amount before the value drops even further.  It sends a clear message that I'm serious about ending the game and getting something for our efforts."
