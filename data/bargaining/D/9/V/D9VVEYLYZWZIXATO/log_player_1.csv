"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. This seems fair since we have 12 rounds to work with, and I'm willing to be generous in the first round to hopefully get the deal done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. If I reject, Bob will propose again in the next round and the value of his offer will decrease further due to inflation. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the circumstances."
