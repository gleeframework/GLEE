"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60/40 in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of $70 is now worth $63 (since $70 * 0.9 = $63).

I'm not too thrilled about the compromise, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm going to reject this offer and wait for the next round. Maybe Bob will be more willing to compromise in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the next round, the money I gain is worth another 10% less due to inflation, so my gain of $63 is now worth $56.40 ($63 * 0.9 = $56.40).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get closer to a fair share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still relatively close to the initial 60/40 split I suggested in the first round. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on me! My gain of $56.40 is now worth $41.11 ($56.40 * 0.727 = $41.11).

Considering the 50/50 split, I'm inclined to accept this offer. It's a fair compromise, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and split the $100 50/50. It's been a wild ride, but I think this is a good ending to the game!"
