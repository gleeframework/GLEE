"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose that I take $9,000 and Bob takes $1,000. This gives me a large share while still leaving something for Bob.  Since this is the first round, I don't anticipate inflation to be a significant factor yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer. While he is proposing a large share for himself, I still have a chance to improve my position.  Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

Since my initial offer was rejected, I will reduce my share slightly to $8,500 and increase Bob's share to $1,500.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a good share for myself.  Inflation is starting to become a factor, but I believe I can still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still much worse for me, even with the inflation considerations.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share if it means continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a better deal later. The inflation is starting to be a serious factor, but I still believe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  Bob's offer is becoming less appealing with inflation, and I believe I can still get a good deal by being persistent."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my initial proposal, and the inflation is hurting him more than me at this point.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I am continuing to lower my desired share, but still aiming for a significant portion. Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unattractive due to inflation, and I believe I can secure a good deal by continuing to negotiate."

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my initial proposal, and the inflation is hurting him more than me at this point.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to try to get a better deal.  I am confident that I can get a better offer in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500} 
```

I'm again reducing my share, but I'm getting closer to what I think is a fair deal. The inflation is really affecting Bob now, and I believe this offer will be tempting enough for him to accept."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is lower than I initially hoped for, the inflation is becoming extremely impactful.  This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, and the risk of getting nothing at all is too great at this point. It's time to accept and move on."
