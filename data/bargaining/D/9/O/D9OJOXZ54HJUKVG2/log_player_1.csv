Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate a little bit depending on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the 50/50 split now rather than risk getting a worse deal in the next round due to inflation."
