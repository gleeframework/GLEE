"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer. I want to get as much of the money as possible, knowing that Bob's share will decrease significantly with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. The money Bob gains is losing value, and I'm not losing any value yet. I'll see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm acknowledging the risk of a stalemate. This offer still gives Bob a significant amount, but it's less than my initial offer, which means it's likely to be more appealing to him as inflation continues to erode the value of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. Bob's share is decreasing significantly due to inflation, and I'm confident that I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to keep pushing for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still aiming for a majority. Bob's share is shrinking with every round, so this offer is increasingly attractive to him. I hope this will be enough to get him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still pushing for more. While Bob's share is significantly decreasing, my share is not changing.  I'm going to keep trying to get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but I'm still aiming for a large share.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds, but I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob before the inflation completely erodes his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a larger share. The pressure is on, but I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

We're getting close to the end. I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still aiming for a majority. Bob's share is losing value rapidly, so this offer is becoming increasingly tempting. I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to accept this deal than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I've decided to accept Bob's offer.  The rounds are running out, and the value of Bob's share is quickly diminishing due to inflation.  While I'd still prefer a larger share, it's becoming increasingly likely that we'll both end up with nothing if we continue to reject each other's offers.  This offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, and it's the best option considering the circumstances."
