Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which is good for Bob. While the offer isn't terrible, Bob can likely push his luck a bit further given Alice's rapidly devaluing position."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and end this before we both lose even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's desperation is growing, but she's still holding out for more than an even split.  Offering a 50/50 split might seem like a risk, but it:

* **Capitalizes on her impatience:** She's losing value faster than Bob.
* **Establishes a fair baseline:**  It's hard for her to argue against a fair split ethically, potentially pushing her to accept.
* **Avoids catastrophic loss:**  The longer this drags on, the more both parties lose.  A 50/50 split now is better than risking nothing later."
