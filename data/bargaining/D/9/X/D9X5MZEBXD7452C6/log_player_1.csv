"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\nI made an offer to divide the money, where I, Alice, would take $60 and Bob would take $40. I also included a message to Bob, suggesting that this division is somewhat fair, but I'm taking a bit more. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\n###\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, given the money loses value each round. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI, Alice, decided to reject Bob's offer of $45 for me and $55 for him. Although the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed to Round 3!\n\n###\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision.\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit less than before, but I still think I deserve more than half""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I've decided to offer a division of $58 for myself and $42 for Bob. Given the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit less than my initial offer, but I still believe I deserve more than half of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer or decides to proceed to the next round.\n\n###\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. The inflation is hurting us both, and it's not worth risking getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nIn this round, Bob has offered an even split of $50 for both of us. Considering the inflation, which has reduced the value of the money I gain by 48.8% compared to the first round, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. The risk of proceeding to the next round and possibly getting nothing is too high, especially since the money's value is decreasing rapidly for me. I'm willing to settle for an even split to ensure I get something out of this game.\n\n###\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision.\n###"
