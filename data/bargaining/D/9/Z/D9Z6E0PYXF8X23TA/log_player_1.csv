I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  I figure this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a decent share while ensuring I get the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm going to try and get a better deal this round.  Since Bob rejected my first offer, I'm going to reduce my share slightly, but still offer him a decent amount. I figure this is a good compromise, as the inflation is starting to take effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While I would prefer to get more, the inflation is hurting me significantly now. A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
