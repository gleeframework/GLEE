Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a bit more. I'll accept Bob's offer if I can get a slightly better deal.

Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll aim to get a slightly better deal. Bob's offer is still a bit too close to the previous one, so I'll reject it.
