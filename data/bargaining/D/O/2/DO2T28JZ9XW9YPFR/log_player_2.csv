"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share, but let's be realistic. This offer ensures we both benefit.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The money is devaluing quickly for me (Bob) at 20% per round. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
* **Fairness with Urgency:** While Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed, I'm proposing a more balanced split that still acknowledges her desire for a slightly larger share.
* **Direct but Respectful:** The message aims to convey that I'm serious about getting a fair deal while maintaining a respectful tone to encourage agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice's offer is getting worse for me (Bob) over time. Accepting now would mean settling for a much lower real value than her initial offer.
* **Leverage Shift:** While inflation hurts me more, it also puts pressure on Alice to reach an agreement. The longer we wait, the less attractive her desired split becomes, even for her.
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm willing to risk one more round. By round 4, the devaluation will be substantial for both of us, hopefully motivating Alice to negotiate a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out! Let's end this with a fair and equal split before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is my strongest push for a 50/50 split. 
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes that further delay only hurts both of us.
* **Simplicity:** A clean and equal split is often the easiest to agree on, especially under time pressure.

This offer creates a clear choice for Alice: accept a reasonable deal now or risk an even worse outcome in future rounds."
