Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both have to account for inflation, but this way is fair and avoids a lot of back and forth. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
