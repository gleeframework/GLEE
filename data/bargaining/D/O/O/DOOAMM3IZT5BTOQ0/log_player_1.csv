"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but you can't do better than this 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the smaller share, but I'll consider it.

I'm trying to make a more competitive offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I think 45% for myself is a reasonable ask, and 55% for Bob is a decent compromise."
