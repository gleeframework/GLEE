"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is my first offer, I'll take 90% and leave 10% for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it, as I'm aware of the inflation, and each round will make the money worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject the offer. Bob is being very greedy, and while I have a small advantage in knowing the inflation, I believe I can do better. I'll take my chance and see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm dropping my offer to 80% for me, and 20% for Bob. I'm still hoping to get a decent share, but I need to be more realistic with my expectations given Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being very greedy, and the inflation is starting to hurt.  I'm going to reject this offer and hope I can negotiate something better in the next round.  It's a risky move, but I need to try and get a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm dropping my offer again to 70% for me and 30% for Bob. I'm feeling the pressure of the inflation, but I'm still hoping to get a decent share. I'm starting to worry that Bob might keep rejecting offers, so I need to be more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still not happy with the offer. Even though the inflation is hurting, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better share in the next round. I'm running out of time, but I'm determined to get a fair share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm getting desperate.  Inflation is really starting to bite now, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount.  This is my last real offer.  If Bob rejects this, I'll be forced to accept whatever he offers me next round, and it will be a lot less."
