Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you should reconsider the 75/25 split, I'm willing to compromise at 80/20 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 2000

Do you accept this offer?","{
