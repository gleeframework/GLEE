"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 700,000 dollars and leave 300,000 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll decide whether to accept or reject Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain:

300,000 * 0.8 = 240,000

Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my initial offer, so I'll accept it.
