"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the majority and you get a small share.  We can make more money in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer seems tempting, it's risky to assume we can make more money in the next round.  A smaller share now is better than nothing later, especially considering the inflation rates. Let's see what Alice offers next."
