"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm sure we can both do better in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though Alice is offering me a significant amount, the money is going to be worth less next round, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split that allows us both to get a good amount.  Let's end this game and avoid any further devaluation of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. My previous offer was generous, and this one reflects the inflation we're both facing. Accept this and we can both walk away with a good sum. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share,  the inflation is hitting my gains hard. Accepting this offer ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting even less in the next round."
