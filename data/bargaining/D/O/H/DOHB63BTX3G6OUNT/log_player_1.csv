"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth even less than before, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth less as well. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal here. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob in an attempt to entice him to accept this offer."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are adding up! With the money worth less and less, I'll have to be even more careful with my decisions. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. My gain of $3500 is worth significantly less than before, and Bob's gain of $6500 is also worth less, but it's a larger share of the total. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The game continues! With the effects of inflation mounting, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, hoping to entice him to accept this offer and avoid further rounds."
