Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that is heavily in my favor. I'm hoping that Bob will accept the offer in the first round, knowing that his share will decrease with each round, while mine increases due to the different inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still very unfair, even with the inflation. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than in my previous offer. However, my share remains significantly larger due to the inflation advantage. I hope he will accept this offer before the inflation further benefits me and makes his share even smaller."
