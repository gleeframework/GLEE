"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 70-30 split, a bit more in my favor this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about the trade-off.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split, especially since the money is worth less for Bob. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more attractive offer to Bob.

Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'll aim for a slightly better split than the 60-40 I proposed earlier.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A 55-45 split, a bit more in my favor, but still fair!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try a 55-45 split, but this time it's my way 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is mirroring my offer from Round 3! However, considering the inflation, the money is worth significantly less for Bob now.

Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, the 55-45 split is actually more in his favor than my original 55-45 offer.

I'll think carefully about this...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's the best I can get at this point."
