Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is making the money worth less and less.

I'm not convinced that this is a fair compromise, especially since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer.
