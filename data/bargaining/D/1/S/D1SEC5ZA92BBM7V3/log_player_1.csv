"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 80% of what I would have gotten in the first round. That's not a bad deal, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the potential for more.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is still eating away at the value of the money, so I need to be strategic.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, considering the value of the money is decreasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now! The money is worth only 48.8% of its original value, which is a significant decrease.

Considering this, I'll have to think carefully about Bob's offer. $300,000 is a relatively small amount, but it's still a significant chunk of the remaining money.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's a good compromise given the circumstances.
