"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair proposal. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept it in the first round, but if not, I'll adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
