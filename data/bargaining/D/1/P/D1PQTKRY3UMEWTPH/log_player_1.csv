"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80 and you get 20. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

This way, I'm taking 80% of the original $100, and Bob gets 20%."
