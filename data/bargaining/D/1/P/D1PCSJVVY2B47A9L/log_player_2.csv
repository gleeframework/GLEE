Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aware of the pressure on Bob due to inflation. She's trying to wear him down with offers slightly better than the last but still heavily in her favor.  While time is ticking, accepting an offer this low would mean losing a significant portion of the potential earnings. It's worth taking more of a calculated risk at this stage."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Let's settle this now. This offer is fair and avoids further losses from inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure is mounting:** With each round, the inflation eats into Bob's potential gains.  
* **Balancing act:** While pushing for a higher amount, it's important to present an offer that seems reasonable enough for Alice to accept. A significant jump from the previous offer might make her reconsider.
* **Finality:** The message emphasizes the need to end the negotiation quickly to avoid further losses."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating away your share 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Alice is right, the inflation is eating into my potential gains. While her offer is still significantly lower than I'd like, the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. 

{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing significantly.
* **Diminishing returns:**  Even if I hold out hope for a better offer, the inflation means the actual value I gain will be significantly less. 
* **Better than nothing:** 440,000 is far from ideal, but it's still a significant sum of money, and better than the alternative of zero."
