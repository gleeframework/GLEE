"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a decent share, but don't expect it to get better from here!""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a fair starting point, and leaves Bob with 20%. The message is just a bit of psychological pressure to make him think he'll get a worse deal if he doesn't accept now."
