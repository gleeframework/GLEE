"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a division of $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for Bob, suggesting a relatively even split to start negotiations. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to set a tone for a reasonable and equitable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, accepting $450,000 in the second round means the value of the money has decreased, making it less favorable than initially proposed. It's strategic to continue negotiations to potentially achieve a better split, despite the decreasing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation on both of our gains, I'm offering a division of $520,000 for myself and $480,000 for Bob. The message ""Meet in the middle"" suggests finding a compromise between our previous offers to reach a mutually acceptable agreement, taking into account the devaluing money. This approach aims to balance the loss due to inflation and nudge Bob towards accepting a slightly less favorable offer than his previous one."
