"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor. Since the money loses value with each round, I want to maximize my gains as quickly as possible. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept this offer rather than risk getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering me a much smaller share than he offered in the previous round, even though the money I gain is worth the same.  It's not a good deal for me. I'm confident I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the first round, but still keeping a significant portion for myself. Bob rejected my initial offer, but I think he's still feeling the pressure of the inflation. I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for him to accept."
