"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a larger share (9000$) while still giving Bob a small amount (1000$). This is a risky strategy, as Bob might reject it, but it maximizes my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation affecting Bob means that accepting this offer is the best option to ensure I get *any* money.  Continuing to reject offers risks both of us ending up with nothing due to the inflation."
