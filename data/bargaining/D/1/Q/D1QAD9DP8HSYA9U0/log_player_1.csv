"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split, and I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 7:3, a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'm not thrilled about the 7:3 split, but I suppose it's a compromise. However, I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""7:3 is a bit too skewed, let's try 55:45 or 52:48?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle or slightly closer to my preferred split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway at 52:48, a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's close to a 50-50 split, but with a slight bias towards me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55:45, a slight adjustment! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns with the 55:45 split. I'm not thrilled about it, but I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still too skewed, let's try 51:49 or 50:50?""
}
```

I'm trying to inch closer to a 50-50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me there."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet at 50:50, a fair and equal split!""
}
```

I'm going all-in on a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will finally agree to a fair and equal division of the money."
