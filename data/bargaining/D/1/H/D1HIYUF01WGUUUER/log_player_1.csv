"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This accounts for the inflation we both face.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:**  The offer is slightly in Alice's favor because her money loses value faster than Bob's due to the higher inflation rate. 
* **First Mover Advantage:** Alice gets to set the initial tone, aiming for a deal that's advantageous but not overly aggressive to discourage Bob from continuing. 
* **Simplicity:** The message is clear and straightforward, emphasizing fairness while subtly highlighting the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation is hitting you harder Alice, but this offer leaves us both with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly worse for Alice than her initial offer. Even accounting for the inflation, accepting this deal would leave Alice with a much smaller portion of the initial amount. While Bob acknowledges the inflation difference, his offer doesn't fairly reflect its impact. Alice should try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 495000,
""bob_gain"": 505000,
""message"": ""Bob, my last offer is still on the table. It's important to strike a deal soon, as the value diminishes with each round.  This offer ensures we both leave with a reasonable amount.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice slightly adjusts her initial offer to appear more flexible but keeps the majority of the concession on Bob's side. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The message reiterates the urgency due to inflation, subtly pushing Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later. 
* **Framing:** By referring to her previous offer, Alice aims to make Bob view it more favorably, especially since his own offer was significantly lower for Alice."
