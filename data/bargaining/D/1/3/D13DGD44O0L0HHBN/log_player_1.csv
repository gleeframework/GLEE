"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly invitation to Bob to make his next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's flip the script! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to get a bit more. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $400,000 and Bob will take $600,000."
