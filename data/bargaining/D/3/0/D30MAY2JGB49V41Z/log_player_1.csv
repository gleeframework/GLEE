Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering your previous offer, and it allows us to both get a decent share of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
