"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start, Bob. What do you think?""
}

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can see how the game goes from here."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'm not sure I want to give Bob a larger share just because he made the proposal this time. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I think this is a fair compromise.""

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'm not sure I want to give Bob a larger share again, especially since the money is worth less for me now. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 5

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out. I'm not sure I want to give Bob a larger share again, but I also don't want to risk going into the next round with an even lower value of money.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's a good compromise given the current circumstances.
