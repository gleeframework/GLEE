"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the original $10,000. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can see how the game unfolds. Your turn, Bob!"
