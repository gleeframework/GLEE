"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, my gain of $30 is now worth $28.25 (30 * 0.942).
Since the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, his gain of $70 is now worth $56 (70 * 0.8).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more than that. I'm willing to compromise, but 30% is a bit too low.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in round 2, so I'll have to adjust my calculation again.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in round 2, my gain of $30 is now worth $28.25 * 0.95 = $26.87 (30 * 0.942 * 0.95).
Since the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in round 2, his gain of $70 is now worth $56 * 0.8 = $44.8 (70 * 0.8).

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the new values:

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $60 is now worth $60 * 0.855 = $51.3.
Since the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, his gain of $40 is now worth $40 * 0.5168 = $20.672 (40 * 0.5168).

However, according to the offer, Bob's gain is $65, and my gain is $35. Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $35 is now worth $35 * 0.855 = $29.97.
Since the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, his gain of $65 is now worth $65 * 0.5168 = $33.51.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more than that. I'm willing to compromise, but 35% is a bit too low.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in round 4, so I'll have to adjust my calculation again.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in round 4, my gain of $35 is now worth $35 * 0.95 = $33.25.

Since the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in round 4, his gain of $65 is now worth $65 * 0.8 = $52.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's a fair deal.""
}
