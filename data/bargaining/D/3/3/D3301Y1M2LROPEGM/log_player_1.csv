"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! You'll get $100,000 and I'll get the rest.""
}
```

I'm making a strong opening offer, hoping to get a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, Alice. It's a fair start, and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $500,000 is now worth only $450,000.

I'm not sure if splitting it down the middle is the best option, considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $300,000, but I need the majority to cover the inflation risk. Don't try to lowball me, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a more aggressive stance, considering the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering 40% for myself and 60% for you. We're both losing value with each round, so let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! My gain of $600,000 is now worth only $438,000.

Bob's offer is a bit more generous than before, but I'm still not sure if I want to give up 40% of the remaining amount.

I'll think about it...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to be realistic about the inflation. You're not getting 40% without giving me a bigger share. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and protecting my own interests."
