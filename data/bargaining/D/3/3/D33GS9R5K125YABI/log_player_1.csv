"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very greedy offer, knowing that Bob has no information about inflation yet.  I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still greedy, the inflation is starting to bite. A 600,000 gain is better than the 799,999.20 I would get if I rejected and went to the next round. It's time to be a bit more realistic!"
