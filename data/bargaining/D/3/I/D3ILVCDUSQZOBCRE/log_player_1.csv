"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60% and you can have 40%.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is more fair. It's closer to even, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 51/49 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the exact numbers as I was initially.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
