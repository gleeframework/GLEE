Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to get the majority of the money right away.  Since Bob's money loses value faster, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid losing more in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better for me in terms of immediate money, but I'm still losing more money in the long run. I'll reject this offer and try to get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try a compromise.  Since Bob's money is losing value much faster, I'll offer him less than before, but hopefully more than he'd get in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my preferred split. Even though I'm losing more than I would have initially, the rate of loss is slowing down. It's getting riskier to reject this offer, as Bob's share is dropping significantly with each round."
