"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose to take 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This is a very generous offer considering I'm playing against an unknown opponent. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, given the inflation and the fact that Bob is clearly not afraid to take a larger share, I'll accept his offer.  It's better to get something than nothing!"
