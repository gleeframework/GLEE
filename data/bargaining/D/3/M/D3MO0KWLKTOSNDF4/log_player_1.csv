"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split. I think 60/40 is a more fair starting point, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the game's current state and the impact of inflation on both players.
We are in Round 3 of the game. In each round, the value of the money decreases due to inflation - by 20% for Alice and by 10% for Bob. This means that with each passing round, the actual value of the money offered decreases more significantly for Alice than for Bob.

### Step 2: Analyze the previous offers and their implications.
In Round 1, Alice offered a 60/40 split in her favor, which Bob rejected. In Round 2, Bob offered the same split but in his favor, which Alice rejected. This indicates that both players initially value their share higher than what the other is willing to offer.

### Step 3: Consider the decreasing value of money and the time pressure.
Given the inflation rates, the longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for Alice. This creates pressure for Alice to reach an agreement sooner rather than later to maximize her gain.

### Step 4: Determine a new offer that takes into account the previous rejections and the impact of inflation.
Considering the previous offers and the pressure of inflation, Alice needs to make an offer that is more appealing to Bob but still maximizes her gain. Since Bob rejected a 60/40 split in Alice's favor and Alice rejected the same split in Bob's favor, a compromise could be a 50/50 split. However, given the higher inflation rate affecting Alice, she might want to slightly adjust this to ensure she gets a bit more value before the money devalues further.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer and message.
Alice decides to offer a slightly adjusted split from the 50/50, considering her higher inflation rate, to incentivize Bob to accept while maximizing her gain.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, let's meet closer to the middle.""}"
