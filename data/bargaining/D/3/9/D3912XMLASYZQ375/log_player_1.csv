I'm going to offer Bob a small amount, hoping to get him to accept in the first round.  I want to maximize my share while the money is still at full value!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a lot of money due to inflation, I would rather take 100,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round.  There's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything at all in the next round, and my share will be worth even less."
