"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5,000 * 0.95 = $4,750
* Bob gain: $5,000 * 0.95 = $4,750

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
