This offer gives me a good starting point, and it's fair considering Bob's money is only depreciating at 10% while mine depreciates at 20%. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, even taking into account the inflation. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm offering a slightly lower amount for myself to try and incentivize Bob to accept. I'm taking into account the inflation, but still trying to secure a decent share."
