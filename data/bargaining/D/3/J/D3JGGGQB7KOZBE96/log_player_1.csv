"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  This is risky, as he might be greedy and want more.  But, if he rejects, I'll have the advantage of making the next offer, and the money will be worth less to him by then."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the value of my share is less due to inflation, accepting this offer guarantees me 500,000, whereas rejecting and making an offer could lead to a worse outcome. It's unlikely Bob would offer me more in the next round, considering his own share would be worth less due to inflation."
