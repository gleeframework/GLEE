Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains. While her offer is closer to a more even split, I believe I can still push for a better deal in the upcoming rounds.  The longer we wait, the more pressure is on her to accept a deal favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's end this. A fair 50/50 split is the best way to ensure we both benefit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I believe I could push for a slightly larger share, offering a 50/50 split in Round 6 accomplishes a few things:

* **Appeals to Fairness:**  It demonstrates a willingness to compromise and be fair, potentially making Alice more receptive. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing increases for both of us. A fair deal now is better than a gamble later.
* **Simplicity:** It cuts through the negotiation and presents a clean, easy-to-accept solution."
