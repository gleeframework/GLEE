"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}

I'm starting with a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a first offer."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",

I'm rejecting this offer and suggesting we continue the game."
