"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. This is a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal and we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

My gain: $500,000 (as proposed)
Bob's gain: $450,000 (10% less than $500,000)

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I think I can do better. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the money is decreasing in value for Bob, but I'll try to make a more attractive offer.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a decent share.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time, but I need to make sure I get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

My gain: $400,000 (as proposed)
Bob's gain: $437,400 (27.1% less than $600,000)

I think this offer is actually more favorable to me than my previous offer, and I'm willing to accept it. I'll take the $400,000.
