"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping the majority for myself while offering Bob a small portion. This is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation and the limited number of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. The inflation will significantly impact my gains in future rounds, and a 50/50 split is fair considering the risk of getting nothing."
