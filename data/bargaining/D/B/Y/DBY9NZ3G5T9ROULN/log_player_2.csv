Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to settle this now. This is my final offer, it's a fair split considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing, especially for me. Waiting any longer significantly risks ending up with nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:** My previous offers were rejected.  Continuing to hold out for a significantly better deal seems unlikely.  
* **Guaranteed Payoff:** Accepting this offer guarantees a payout, even if reduced by inflation. Rejecting it puts me at the mercy of Alice's future offers, with the risk of walking away with nothing. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting the current offer mitigates the risk of losing a significant amount of money due to continued inflation."
