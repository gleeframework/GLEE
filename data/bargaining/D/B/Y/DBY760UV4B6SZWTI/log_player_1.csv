Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}

This is a tough decision, but I have to accept. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The 40.95% inflation means I'm losing a HUGE chunk of the potential gains with each passing round. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's offers have been steadily getting worse.  It's unlikely he'll significantly improve in future rounds. 
* **Something is Better than Nothing:** While $250,000 is a lot less than I aimed for, it's still a significant sum, and much better than walking away with nothing if I keep rejecting and lose all value. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the relentless inflation makes it too risky to gamble on future rounds."
