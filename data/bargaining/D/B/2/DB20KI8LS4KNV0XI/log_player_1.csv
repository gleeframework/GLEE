# Bob's message: I think we can do better. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need a bit more for myself to get started. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll think about it.
