"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly to start. You can make a better offer next round!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and Bob has an incentive to make a better offer in the next round."
