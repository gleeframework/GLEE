"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think carefully about it.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take $450,000 and Bob will take $550,000."
