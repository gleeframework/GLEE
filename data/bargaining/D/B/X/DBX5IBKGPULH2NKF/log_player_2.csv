Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. Remember, the money is losing value with each round. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential earnings, especially considering the inflation working against me. I need to push for a more balanced deal."

""alice_gain"": 480000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer, but I'll budge slightly. Let's split it 51/49 in my favor. The money is still losing value for both of us, and we need to come to a decision soon. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging and trying to use the time pressure against me. While a 51/49 split is getting closer to a fair deal, accepting now would still mean losing out on a significant sum due to the accumulated inflation.  I need to hold firm and make it clear that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better offer."

""alice_gain"": 495000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50.5/49.5 split in my favor.  This is practically even, considering the inflation is eating into my share with every second that passes.  Accept this offer, and let's move on.""
