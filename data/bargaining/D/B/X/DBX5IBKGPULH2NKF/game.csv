350000.0,650000.0,"That's heavily skewed towards you, Alice. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. Consider the decreasing value and the limited rounds we have.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. Remember, the money is losing value with each round. Let's get this done.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Time is running out, Alice.  My new offer is a 52/48 split in my favor. This reflects the time pressure and the fact that you're not losing any value.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"I'm sticking with my previous offer, but I'll budge slightly. Let's split it 51/49 in my favor. The money is still losing value for both of us, and we need to come to a decision soon.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
495000.0,505000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50.5/49.5 split in my favor.  This is practically even, considering the inflation is eating into my share with every second that passes.  Accept this offer, and let's move on.",Bob,6,
