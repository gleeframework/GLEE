"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a very slight advantage for myself, but I want to be fair. This ensures a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in future rounds."
