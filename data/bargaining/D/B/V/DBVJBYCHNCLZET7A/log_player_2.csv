# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  The money is worth less to Alice, and I have a few more rounds to play."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is fair and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for more, the inflation is hitting Alice harder and harder.  A 50/50 split is a good outcome considering the circumstances."
