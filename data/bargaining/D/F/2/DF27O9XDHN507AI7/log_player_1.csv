"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering to split the $10,000 equally between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
