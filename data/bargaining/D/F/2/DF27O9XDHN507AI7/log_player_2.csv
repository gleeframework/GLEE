"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, the $10,000 is now equivalent to $9,000 for me. I'll make an offer to divide the money. Here it is:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less for me now, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly. The $10,000 is now equivalent to $8,100 for me. Alice's offer is:

# Bob gain: 4500
# Alice gain: 5500

Since 4500 is more than 40% of 8,100, I'll accept this offer.
