Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split this more evenly.  I'm willing to take a slight cut from your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""Okay, let's try this again.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need to get the majority.  90 for me, 10 for you.  Let's end this.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we both made a concession.  Let's split the money more evenly this time. I'm willing to give you 10, but I need at least 90 to make this worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While the inflation is hurting me significantly, taking 10 is better than getting nothing in the next round. I'm hoping Bob is being reasonable and won't push for more in the next round."
