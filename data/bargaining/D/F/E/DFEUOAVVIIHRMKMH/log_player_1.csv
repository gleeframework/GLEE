"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. My message to Bob is ""Let's start with a fair split"", trying to make a friendly opening offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $32.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, as it seems he's trying to take a larger share of the money. I'd like to reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again due to inflation, my gain of $32 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $25.60.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split in Bob's favor, with me getting $45.60 and Bob getting $54.40. My message to Bob is ""Meet me in the middle"", trying to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I'm getting closer to what I want 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% inflation, my gain of $45.60 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is approximately $23.31.

Bob's offer is a 30-70 split, which is not favorable to me. I'd like to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less again due to inflation, my gain of $23.31 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is approximately $11.94.

Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""Getting close, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 35-65 split in Bob's favor, with me getting $23.80 and Bob getting $76.20. My message to Bob is ""Getting close, but I need a bit more"", trying to convey that I'm willing to compromise but still want a slightly better deal."
