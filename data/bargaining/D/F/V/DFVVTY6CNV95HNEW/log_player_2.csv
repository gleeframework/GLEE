"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a nice chunk to start with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is good for the first round, I'm not willing to accept such a large disparity so early in the game. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  Let's get this done before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this offer is better than the first one, I still believe I can secure a more equitable split.  The inflation rate is starting to be a concern, but I'm willing to risk one more round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need a substantial amount as well to make this worthwhile. We're both losing money with each round.""
