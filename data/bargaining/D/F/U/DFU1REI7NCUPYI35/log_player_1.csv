"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential earnings! I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Bob's offer is still relatively close to the original split, I'll consider it a reasonable option. I'll accept this offer.
