"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $4,000. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm trying to get the majority of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 50/50, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to split it 50/50, huh? That's a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I should take what I can get.

I accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
