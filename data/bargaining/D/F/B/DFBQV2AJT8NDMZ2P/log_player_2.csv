"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share, but you'll get a nice chunk to start with.  We can work things out if you think this is unfair. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's a generous starting offer, 100,000 is a small fraction of the total, and there's a lot of time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be more even. I'm offering you 600,000, which is a good starting point for negotiation. We can work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, with inflation kicking in, accepting this offer is the best option for me in the long run. It ensures a significant gain, and the risk of getting nothing in later rounds is too high."
