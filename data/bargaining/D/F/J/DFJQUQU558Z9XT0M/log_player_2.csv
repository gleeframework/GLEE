**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but her offer is getting worse for me with each round due to inflation. I need to hold my ground. While her offer seems tempting,  getting only 400,000 in round 7 means I'm actually getting a much worse deal than that. I'm communicating my seriousness and willingness to go for a 50/50 split in the hopes she'll concede a bit more next round."
