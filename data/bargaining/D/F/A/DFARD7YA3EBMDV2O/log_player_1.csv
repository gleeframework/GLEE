"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for our negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too greedy, let's try a bit more balanced! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to drive a harder bargain!

I'll consider his offer, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 70-30 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, my money is worth 5% less than in round 2, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 32-68 split!""
}
```

I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm making a stronger move! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation! With the money being worth less and less, I need to be more careful with my decisions.

However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than his previous one, and I'm not sure I want to risk going to another round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take Bob's offer of $450,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking further erosion of my potential earnings due to inflation."
