"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's start with a clean slate.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We can avoid the inflation and get a better deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I think I can get a better offer if I wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the initial proposal.""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $100, which is $70, and Bob gets the remaining 30%, which is $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We need to compromise to get a good deal with the inflation.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll take a bit less, and we can both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less than before. I'm willing to accept the 55% share and get $55, as it's a fair deal given the current situation."
