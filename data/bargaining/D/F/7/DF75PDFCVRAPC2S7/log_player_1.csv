"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 85,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my turn offers a fairer deal for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While Bob's message sounds understanding, his offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. Even with inflation, accepting $40 now is much worse than potentially getting a better offer in a future round. I'm willing to gamble a bit more, hoping Bob will propose a more reasonable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's try this again. The clock is ticking, and this offer still gives you a reasonable share before inflation eats further into things.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer benefits us both.  You're losing value fast with each delay. Let's be practical and end this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:** The relentless inflation is making this incredibly difficult. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer now gets me $45. If I reject it and make another offer in Round 5, even if Bob generously offered me $60 (which is unlikely), after inflation, it would be worth less than $45 to me. 

It's painful to see Bob get the larger share, but the longer this goes on, the more the shrinking pot hurts me."
