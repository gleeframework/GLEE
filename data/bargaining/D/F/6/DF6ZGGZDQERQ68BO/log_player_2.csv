"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I'm also trying to get the most I can.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob!  We can do much better. Let's see what kind of offer I can make in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Think about it: it's better to take a good deal now than risk getting a worse one later as inflation eats away at our potential gains.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob, but I need more than 4000. Inflation is hurting us both, and I think we can both do better if we work together. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting closer, but that's still not a good deal for me. I'll need to counter with something more enticing in the next round to avoid getting lowballed as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to 5500, leaving you with 4500. This deal considers the impact of inflation on both our ends and is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and avoid losing out further.""
