"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob a relatively small share, as I want to maximize my own gains.  Since the money inflates at different rates for each of us, I want to try to secure a good deal quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him! This offer is worse than the first round, and I'm not going to accept it.  I'll make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to try to compromise a little bit this round, but I'm still aiming for a large share.  I'll offer Bob a slightly bigger portion, but I'm not going to give him more than 150,000. Let's see if he's more reasonable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low.  The inflation is hurting me more than it's hurting him, and I'm not willing to accept this offer.  It's time to try a different approach."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a bold strategy this round. I'm going to significantly increase Bob's share, hoping to incentivize him to accept. The inflation is hitting me hard now, and I need to secure a deal before the situation gets worse.  It's a gamble, but it's a risk I'm willing to take."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking advantage of the increasing inflation. I'm not going to give him more than 400,000. I'm going to try to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to try a compromise again. I'm increasing Bob's share slightly, but I'm not giving him more than 550,000. I'm hoping that he'll see the value in accepting this offer before the inflation gets even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is getting out of control, and I need to accept this offer.  While it's not ideal, it's the best I can get at this point.  I'm better off taking 550,000 now than risking getting nothing at all in the future."
