"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better, let's split it evenly.  
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to try to get a bit more, considering the reduced value of the money. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 5% reduction in the value of the money I gain, I'll aim to get a bit more this round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping that Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game!"
