"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going for a classic 90/10 split. It's a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is a lot worse than my initial proposal.  I'll counter with a better split in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly, but still offer Bob a decent amount.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round. I'll counter with a better split in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to give up some more to avoid getting a worse deal from Bob. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, this offer is still better than what I'd get if I continue to reject and risk getting a worse deal from Bob. It's time to end this game!"
