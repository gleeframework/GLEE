"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $60 and leave $40 for Bob, with a message suggesting this is a fair division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair division. Let's go with this. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me but 20% less to Bob, I have more negotiating power. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'll take a bit more than before, considering that the money is worth the same to me but less to Bob due to inflation. I'm trying to put some pressure on Bob to accept, while still leaving him with a significant amount. The message is meant to make Bob realize that this is a relatively good deal, given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I believe I can still get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me but almost 50% less to Bob due to inflation, I have even more negotiating power. Bob's message says this is his final offer, but I'm willing to take the risk and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Last chance before I take it all""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'll take an even larger share, considering that the money is worth significantly less to Bob due to inflation. The message is meant to pressure Bob into accepting, implying that if he rejects, I'll try to take the entire amount in the next round. This is a risk, but given the circumstances, I believe Bob may be willing to accept this deal rather than risk getting nothing."
