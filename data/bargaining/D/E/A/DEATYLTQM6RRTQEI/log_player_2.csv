"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide the money fairly. I propose we split it 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I want to see what Alice will offer in the next round.  I suspect I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair and reasonable starting point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've adjusted my proposal based on the previous round's outcome. A 60/40 split seems fair to me now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm unsure how much the inflation affects Alice. It's likely she'll reject further offers, and with each round, the value of my potential gains decreases.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing."
