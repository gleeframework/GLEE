"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60% of the money, leaving you with 40%. Let's split the remaining 100,000,000 in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need a bit more for myself. Let's work together and avoid losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a slightly better deal for me than my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation."
