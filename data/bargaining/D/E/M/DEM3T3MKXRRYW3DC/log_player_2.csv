"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation.  Let's work together to get this done.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but my previous offer was already generous. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor.  Time is running out, and we both lose if we don't agree soon. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
