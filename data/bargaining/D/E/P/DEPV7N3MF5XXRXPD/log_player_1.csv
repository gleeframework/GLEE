"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a decent amount for both of us.""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, with me getting 80% and Bob getting 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll give you a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 3:2 ratio, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
