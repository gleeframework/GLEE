Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, Bob's offer is less appealing now.
