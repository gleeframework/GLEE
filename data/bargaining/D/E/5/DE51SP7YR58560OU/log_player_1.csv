"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for my skills. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I don't think I can accept this offer. Meeting halfway at 50-50 is a bit too generous for me, considering the initial proposal was 60-40. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my efforts. Let's meet at 55-45.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more. I'm willing to meet you at 55-45, but I want it to be 55.5-44.5 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I think I can live with a 55.5-44.5 split, but I'm not thrilled about it. However, I'm not sure if I can do better, and the offer is not far off from my previous proposal.
