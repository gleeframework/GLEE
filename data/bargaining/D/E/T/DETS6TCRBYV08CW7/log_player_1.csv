I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Since I'm the one making the offer, I'm taking a larger share.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though the money is worth less, it's still more than I would get if we continue to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer."
