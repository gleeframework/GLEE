"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 300,000 is now worth 240,000. Bob's gain of 700,000 is still worth 700,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it's a bit lopsided in Bob's favor. I'll have to think about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a fairer split than 70/30. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping for a slightly larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the split. I think I deserve a bigger share considering the current market conditions. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% inflation, my gain of 200,000 is now worth 104,160. Bob's gain of 800,000 is still worth 800,000.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'm not sure I can afford to reject another offer and risk losing even more value.
