"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a straightforward and simple proposal. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Accept my offer and let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for Bob, his offer is less attractive than it initially seemed. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 800,000 for me, I'll try to get more than that. I'll offer him a smaller share, but still a significant amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Don't be greedy, Bob! Take this fair offer and let's move on!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger toll on Bob's offer, I'll consider this one. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, and it's a decent offer considering the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
