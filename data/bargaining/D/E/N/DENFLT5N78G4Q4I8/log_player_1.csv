"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to change his mind and now wants a 60-40 split in his favor!

I'll reject this offer since it's not in my favor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
