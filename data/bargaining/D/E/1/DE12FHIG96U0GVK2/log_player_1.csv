"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money I gain due to inflation, I'd like to reconsider Bob's offer. 

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
