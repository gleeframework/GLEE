"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 70-30 in my favor""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting the majority of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to be generous 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the offer from Bob is actually a worse deal for me than the original 70-30 split.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You're not being very generous, I'll take 45 and leave you with 55""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go easy on you 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, the offer from Bob is still a bit too generous for him, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a slightly better deal for me than my previous offer, and I don't want to risk going to another round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
