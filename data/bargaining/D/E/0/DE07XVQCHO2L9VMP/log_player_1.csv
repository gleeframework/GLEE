"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair for me to get a little more since you rejected my offer. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

Bob's offer is 400,000 for me and 600,000 for him. That's a 40/60 split, which is not as favorable as my initial 50/50 offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving me $550,000 and Bob $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. This way we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

Bob's offer is 450,000 for me and 550,000 for him. This is a 45/55 split, which is actually a worse offer for me compared to my previous offer of 55/45. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the increasing inflation and the fact that Bob's offer in the previous round was not favorable to me, I'll aim for a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, so I'm taking a firmer stance. Meet me halfway, and we can avoid further rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
