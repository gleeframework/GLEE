"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if Bob is trying to trick me or not, but I'll consider his offer.

Considering the inflation, my gain of 70 is actually 56 (70 * 0.8) in real value. Not bad, but I was hoping for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I need to make up for the lost value due to inflation""}

I'm trying to make up for the lost value due to inflation by proposing a slightly larger share for myself, but still leaving a small portion for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 80 is actually 40.8 (80 * 0.512) in real value. This is a decent offer, but I was hoping for a better deal.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will make up for the lost value in future rounds.
