# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being patient 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but time is working against me.  While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting Alice's offer gets me something rather than risking getting even less in future rounds as inflation eats away at my potential gains."
