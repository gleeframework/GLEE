"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll need to reassess the offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this time."
