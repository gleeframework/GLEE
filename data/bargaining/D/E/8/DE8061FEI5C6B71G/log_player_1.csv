"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, my friend!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money, leaving 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```

}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. With the inflation, my gain is worth 40% of what it was in the first round (80% x 0.8 = 64% of the original amount). I'll take that into account when making my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Will this one work for you?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but not all 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (80% x 0.64 = 51.2% of the original amount). I'll consider this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
