Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed a concern, but I believe we can still find a more favorable division that acknowledges my initial generosity. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game is entering a critical phase. While Alice acknowledges inflation, her offers are not reflecting the urgency. She's likely hoping I'll cave in and accept a less favorable deal as the rounds progress.  It's risky, but I need to push for a more balanced outcome."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. Inflation is rapidly eroding the value of this prize. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this point.  Don't let greed cloud your judgment.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The game is at a tipping point.  Going for anything less than an even split is too risky now.  By firmly proposing a 50/50 split, I'm communicating that I'm willing to risk it all for a fair deal. This puts the pressure on Alice to make a decision: accept a fair deal now or potentially lose everything due to her own greed."
