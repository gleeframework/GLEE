"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While 60-40 seems fair at face value, Alice is disproportionately affected by inflation. It's in my best interest to wait for a counter-offer where I get a larger share, as the perceived value of the money decreases faster for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but the value decreases quickly for you.  I propose 60-40 in my favor.  It's a strong offer considering the circumstances.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. 58-42 is the best I can offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still trying to secure a larger portion of the money, even though its value depreciates rapidly for her. I'll hold out a little longer, hoping the inflation pushes her towards a more favorable split for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and the value diminishes significantly for you with each round.  My 65-35 offer is more than fair considering the situation."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I still believe I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is stubbornly clinging to the idea of a larger share, even though the real-world value is diminishing rapidly for her.  I'll hold firm, the pressure is on her to make a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
