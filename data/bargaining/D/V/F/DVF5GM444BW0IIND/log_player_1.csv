I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I have the first move advantage and inflation will be more advantageous to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I'd like more, I recognize that Bob is now in a position where inflation is significantly impacting him. This offer should be attractive to him, as he's getting a larger share than he received in the previous round, and I'm willing to concede some of my initial advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's inflation is now hurting him significantly, I'm still gaining a decent amount compared to the previous round, especially given the inflation rate. This is a good deal for me, and I'm willing to accept it."
