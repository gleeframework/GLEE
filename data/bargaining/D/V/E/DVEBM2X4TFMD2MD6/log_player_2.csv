"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Your cut is reduced due to inflation, but I'm offering a bit more than last time for a quick deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  It's crucial to acknowledge the inflation. Delaying benefits Alice more than me. 
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** I'm aiming for a slightly better deal than Alice offered but trying to make it attractive enough to avoid another round of depreciation. 
* **Urgency:** Highlighting the time pressure (""quick deal"") might nudge Alice towards acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's settle, my patience wears thin 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting impatient, but that doesn't mean I should accept a bad deal.  Her offer is slightly better than her first, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more the inflation disparity benefits me. I need to hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer: a perfectly even split. Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value any further.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Shift:**  Alice is getting impatient, but I need to show I'm also unwilling to settle for a bad deal. A 50/50 split is fair and may be the best I can get at this point.
* **Finality:**  By stating it's my ""final offer,"" I add weight and urgency, pushing Alice towards a decision. 
* **Inflation Reminder:**   Emphasizing the shrinking pie keeps the focus on the cost of delaying."
