Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 70-30 split in my favor, reflecting the risk of inflation.  As the proposer, I'm taking the risk of having the offer rejected and losing a potential 10% of my share in the next round. Consider it carefully. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{
