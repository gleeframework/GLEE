"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my strategy.
