"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 80-20 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair.  Let's both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more generous than I expected, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll decide to reject the offer and see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the total amount of money is now effectively $9,000 (10,000 * 0.9).

Considering the previous offers, I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
