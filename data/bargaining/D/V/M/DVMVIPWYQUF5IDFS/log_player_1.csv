"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to negotiate, I like that!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $250,000 is actually worth $237,500 in real terms. That's still a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn again!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, aiming for a 55-45 split. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take advantage of my decreasing offer value due to inflation!

Let's calculate the real value of my gain in round 4: $400,000 is worth $342,800 in real terms.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'll consider it. I'm not giving up much more than before, but I'm also not getting a better deal.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in future rounds.
