Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  The clock is ticking and it's only getting worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While the offer is significantly less than what I'd prefer, it's better than nothing. The inflation is making each round worse for me, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
