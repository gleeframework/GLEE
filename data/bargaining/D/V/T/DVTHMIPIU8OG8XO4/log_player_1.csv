Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to meet halfway.  I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid further losses. We need to come to an agreement soon or we'll both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving towards a more equitable split, the pace is too slow. The inflation is eating away at Bob's share much faster than Alice's.  This makes him increasingly likely to accept a less favorable deal in later rounds.  Alice can likely secure a better outcome by continuing to negotiate from a position of strength."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go back to the original split we discussed in round 1.  The value is dropping rapidly, and we both need to act quickly.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky one! While ideally, Alice could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer in Round 6 is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is hitting Bob far harder than Alice. This offer, while favoring Alice, still holds significant value for Bob, especially considering the rapidly decreasing worth of the money.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, Bob is feeling the pressure. He's gone back to his initial offer, indicating a willingness to settle to avoid walking away with nothing.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer means Alice is gambling on Bob becoming even more desperate in later rounds. However, there's also the risk Bob might make less favorable offers, hoping Alice caves under time pressure. 

It's a close call, but accepting now secures a favorable outcome for Alice with minimal risk."
