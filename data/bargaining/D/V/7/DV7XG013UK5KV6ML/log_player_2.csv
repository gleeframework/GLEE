"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling generous today. Take this offer before inflation eats away at your share! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob.  While it might seem like a good idea to take something rather than nothing, the fact that the money depreciates by 20% each round means Bob will likely get a much better offer in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Alice, it's time to turn the tables! This offer is fair and keeps inflation at bay for both of us. Let's end this game now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like you're having trouble with the concept of inflation. I'm offering you a lifeline here, but don't wait too long! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still not a good deal for Bob. Bob's share is worth much less due to inflation, and since he can propose in the next round, he has a good chance of getting a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6400, ""alice_gain"": 3600, ""message"": ""Alice, we've both been playing this game for a while now. Let's be realistic. This is the best we can both do with inflation in mind. Accept and we can both move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it before inflation eats away even more of your potential winnings. It's a fair deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to take something after so many rejections, Bob's share is worth significantly less than Alice's.  It's still worth pushing for a better deal in the next round, as there's a chance Bob can get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, we've been through this. Inflation is eating away at my share, and this is the best I can offer while still being fair. Let's end this now.""}
