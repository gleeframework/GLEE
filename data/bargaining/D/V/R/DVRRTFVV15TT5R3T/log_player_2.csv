Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My patience is wearing thin, this is the final offer 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, it's really coming down to the wire.  Let's analyze:

* **Round 7 Offer:** $3500 (after inflation)
* **Potential Round 8 Offer:** Even if I could get Alice to agree to a 50/50 split in the next round, the inflation would mean I'd likely get approximately $2500. 

It's painful, but waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse outcome for me."
