"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a good starting point to move forward.  Accept and we can end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give Bob a 55/45 split, that's a bit too skewed in his favor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting Bob's share, I'll make a new offer that takes that into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle and move forward.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a significant reduction from his previous offer, but still a decent amount considering the inflation."
