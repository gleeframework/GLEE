Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a division of $9,000 for myself and $1,000 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor."

This is a tough call. I'm getting a pretty low offer, but if I keep rejecting, I'm risking getting nothing. However, I still have a few rounds to play. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, we'll reach the end of the game and both of us will get nothing.  I'm hoping I haven't made a mistake."
