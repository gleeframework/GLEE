"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money now""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the division of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This offer is fair and avoids further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, but Bob's offer is still a 50-50 split, which is a fair one. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
