"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI can try to get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'll try to be strategic about it.\n\nPlease let me know what's next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll try to get a better deal to compensate for the loss. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, Bob, but I don't think you deserve all the benefits of inflation. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the current offer and the impact of inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. With each passing round, the money is worth less to me, so I'll try to be strategic about it.\n\nPlease let me know what's next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice.""}\n\nI'll try to find a middle ground that takes into account the impact of inflation on my gains. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a reasonable offer. Let's see how she responds!"
