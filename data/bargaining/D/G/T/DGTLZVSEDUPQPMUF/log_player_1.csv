"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, which means I'm getting a better deal than Bob.

Considering the offer, I'll accept it. I'll take $4000 and Bob will take $6000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
