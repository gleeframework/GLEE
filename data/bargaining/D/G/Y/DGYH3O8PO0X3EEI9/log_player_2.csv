Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's be practical - this offer benefits us both. Time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her due to inflation. While her offer isn't terrible in a vacuum, we're likely to get an even better deal if we hold out a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm being generous. Take this offer now, or the deal will only get worse for you.""} 

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point, and Alice's offers are getting increasingly desperate.  This offer is slightly better than her last, and it's unlikely she'll accept anything less favorable to her at this stage. We need to start pushing our advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. A 50/50 split.  It's the only fair option left. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more from Alice, a 50/50 split is a strong offer at this stage. The risk of getting nothing in the later rounds is significant, and Alice's desperation suggests she won't offer anything better than this."
