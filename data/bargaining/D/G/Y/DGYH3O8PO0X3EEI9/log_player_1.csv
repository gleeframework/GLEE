Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to benefit Alice, but this is a one-time offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is playing a tough game, but we need to hold our ground a little longer. Accepting this offer would give us less than our offer in Round 3 after accounting for inflation. We need to show Bob we're serious about getting a fair deal and are willing to risk it for a better outcome."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's be practical - this offer benefits us both. Time is running out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting into the later rounds, and Bob needs to understand the time pressure. We've lowered our demand slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but we're still aiming for a larger share, knowing that inflation is eroding our potential gains. This offer is a compromise aimed at securing a deal before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm being generous. Take this offer now, or the deal will only get worse for you. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point. While Bob claims generosity, this offer is simply a reversal of our previous one, and significantly worse than what we proposed in Round 3 after accounting for inflation.  Bob is clearly trying to exploit the time pressure. We need to show we're willing to risk it for a better deal, and hope he understands the situation will only worsen for him too if we run out of rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. A 50/50 split.  It's the only fair option left. Let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're past the halfway point, and it's time to get serious. Offering a 50/50 split might seem like a compromise, but considering the time pressure and inflation working against us, it's our best bet. It sends a clear message: Bob is risking everything by continuing this game. This offer is our strongest attempt to secure a deal before the rapidly inflating money makes any potential deal unattractive."
