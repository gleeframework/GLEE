"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and equal division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have 20, I'll take the rest 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. If I accept, I'll get $20, but since it's worth 10% less due to inflation, it's equivalent to $18 in the first round's value.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you can have 40, it's a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
