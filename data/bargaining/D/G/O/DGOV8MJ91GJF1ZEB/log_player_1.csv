"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Considering the inflation effect, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice gain: 58 -> 58 * 0.9 = 52.2 (due to 10% decrease)
Bob gain: 42 -> 42 * 0.95 = 40.1 (due to 5% decrease)

In real terms, I would be getting 52.2 and Bob would be getting 40.1. This is a relatively small difference, and I'm willing to accept this offer.
