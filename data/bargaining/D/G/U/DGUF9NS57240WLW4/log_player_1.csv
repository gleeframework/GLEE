"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to give Bob a decent share to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent share too. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer, I'd rather not accept this proposal. I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to meet Bob in the middle, but still trying to get a slightly better share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!
