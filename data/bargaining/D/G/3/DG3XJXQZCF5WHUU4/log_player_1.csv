"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point and Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger share, but the money is worth less to you each round.  Let's avoid losing any more money. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so my gain of $750,000 is now worth $600,000. Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $300,000, which is worth $240,000 after inflation.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid losing more money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
