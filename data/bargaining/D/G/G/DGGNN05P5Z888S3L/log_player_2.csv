While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly.  Waiting any longer dramatically reduces potential winnings for both players.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in later rounds isn't worth the risk of losing everything if no agreement is reached.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this. Her offers have been relatively consistent, and she is also subject to inflation, albeit at a slower rate. 

Accepting a 45/55 split isn't ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing when the alternative was so risky."
