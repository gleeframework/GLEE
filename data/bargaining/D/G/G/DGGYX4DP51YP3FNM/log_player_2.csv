"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation, but ensures you get a good chunk too. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Alice's offer is okay, but I want to see if she's willing to budge a bit."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly, taking into account the inflation rates. This offers you a good share while ensuring a fair outcome for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a more even split, but the inflation is working against me. This offer is a compromise, slightly closer to the middle ground while acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 370000 
# Alice gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still closer to the initial split than what I proposed. While the inflation is a factor, I still believe I can get a better deal, especially with the pressure on Alice increasing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but this is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, the inflation will eat away at our potential gains.""}
