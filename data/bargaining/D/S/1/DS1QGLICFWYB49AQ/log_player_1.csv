"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a straightforward 10% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's fair and reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in splitting it evenly, as it would leave me with a gain of 500,000, which is worth 40% less than my initial offer. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide it into a 60/40 split, Alice. It's a balanced approach. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept the 60/40 split, as it's a relatively balanced approach and I'd rather have some of the remaining money than risk going into further rounds."
