I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a generous offer, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  We've both seen the value of the money decrease, and I believe this is a fair compromise."
