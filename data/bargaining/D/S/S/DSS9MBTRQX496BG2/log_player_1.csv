"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but leaves a small amount for Bob to incentivize him to accept it.  I'm hoping he'll accept in the first round, as the inflation will start to impact the value of the money in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to have more money, the inflation is starting to take effect. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half of the money, which is better than risking getting less in the future rounds."
