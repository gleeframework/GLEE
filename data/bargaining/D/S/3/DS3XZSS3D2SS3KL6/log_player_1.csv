"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and fair: a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation puts me at a disadvantage with each passing round. I need to push for a slightly better split to compensate for this disadvantage, even if it means risking another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5463,
""bob_gain"": 4537,
""message"": ""Bob, I need a bit more to account for the inflation. This offer still gives you a significant share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It accounts for the inflation while still giving us both a good deal. Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This offer is better than the 50/50 split Bob proposed earlier and only slightly lower than what I countered in Round 3. Considering the inflation, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting. Accepting this offer ensures I get a reasonable amount, even if it's not ideal."
