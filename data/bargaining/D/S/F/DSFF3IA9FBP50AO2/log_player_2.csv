Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical decision for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than risking getting even less later.
* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice is clearly aware of the inflation and has moved closer to a more balanced split, recognizing the urgency for both parties to settle.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. It's possible her offers will become less favorable to Bob as the game progresses. 

While Bob could gamble on getting a slightly better deal later, the risk of losing even more value due to inflation is too high. Taking the guaranteed, albeit slightly smaller, amount now is the safer and more strategic move."
