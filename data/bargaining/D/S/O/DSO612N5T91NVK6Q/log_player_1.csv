Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation, particularly on your end, I believe this offer is a reasonable adjustment. It's becoming more crucial for me to secure a larger share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The inflation is hitting me (Alice) much harder than Bob.  Each round sees a significant drop in the real value of my potential gain. Waiting any longer will likely result in even worse offers.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob knows the inflation is working in his favor. He's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this, as he can afford to wait and watch my potential earnings shrink. 
* **Securing a Reasonable Amount:** Accepting 4000 USD now, even with the inflation, is better than risking even lower offers in future rounds where the money will be worth significantly less. 

It's a tough decision, but the rapidly decreasing value due to inflation makes accepting this offer the most rational choice to salvage a decent portion of the initial sum."
