"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is not significantly better than the initial 50/50 split, I'm going to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a fair share""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly more generous split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

While Bob's offer is still not extremely generous, it's getting closer to a fair split. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a relatively small difference from my initial 50/50 proposal.
