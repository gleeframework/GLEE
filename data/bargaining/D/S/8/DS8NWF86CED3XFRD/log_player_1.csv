"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can both walk away happy!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the money is worth 5% less now. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll offer a slightly smaller share to Bob. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think 55 is a fair share""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but not too generous, considering the decreasing value of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 48, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable this time. I'll accept it.
