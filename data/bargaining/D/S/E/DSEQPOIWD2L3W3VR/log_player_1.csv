"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it from that perspective. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. That's a significant reduction from my initial proposal of $5,000.

However, I also need to consider the fact that Bob is making the offer and might be trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Maybe I can come up with a better proposal or Bob will make a more generous offer.
