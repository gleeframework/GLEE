"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I'll take 60% this time, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the effective value of the offer.

Let's calculate the effective values:

My gain: $4,000 (same as before)
Bob's gain: $6,000 Ã— 0.8 (20% less due to inflation) = $4,800

I'm not sure if I want to accept a $4,000 gain when Bob's gain is effectively $4,800. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
