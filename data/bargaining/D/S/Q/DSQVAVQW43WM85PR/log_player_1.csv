"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll need to consider that in my decision.

The actual amount I'll gain in Round 2 is 400,000 x 0.8 = 320,000.

I'll reject the offer because I'm not getting as much as I would have liked, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 40% of its original value (0.8^2 = 0.64). To make my offer more attractive, I'll try to get a larger share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```"
