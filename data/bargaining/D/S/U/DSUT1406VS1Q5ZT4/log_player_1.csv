"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too hard. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I need to consider the value of the money I gain in relation to the value of Bob's gain.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I'm getting a smaller share compared to the first round, and the value of my gain is the same as before. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable offer considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, trying to squeeze a bit more for myself while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think this is still a good compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values of the gains:

My gain of 5800 is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's gain of 4200 is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which is 0.7289 times the original value.

Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth less, I should be more willing to accept this offer. However, I'll still try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to push for an even better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think this is still a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6200 
# Bob gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values of the gains:

My gain of 6200 is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's gain of 3800 is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, which is 0.5925 times the original value.

Considering the significant inflation, I think Bob's offer is relatively generous. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential losses due to inflation.
