7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to have a significant portion of the funds while minimizing potential conflict.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the diminishing value of the money for Alice. Let's reach an agreement and avoid further rounds.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
