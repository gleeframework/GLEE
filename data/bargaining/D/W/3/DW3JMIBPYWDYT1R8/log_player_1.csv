"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 60-40, with me getting the larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed by Bob's offer. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to flip the script and offer a 60-40 split in my favor this time.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Your turn to take the risk of rejection! I'll take the larger share this time.""}
