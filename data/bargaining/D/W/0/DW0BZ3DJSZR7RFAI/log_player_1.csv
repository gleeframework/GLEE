"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and reasonable offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is fair, let's flip the script.  700000 for me, 300000 for you. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to turn the tables on me!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 300,000 x 0.9 = 270,000
* Bob gain: 700,000 x 0.9 = 630,000

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 7:3 in his favor, I'll try to offer a more balanced split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him!"
