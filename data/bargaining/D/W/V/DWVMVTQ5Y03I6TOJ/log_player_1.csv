"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a very unfair but potentially effective strategy. I'll take almost all the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar.  This is a gamble, but I'm hoping Bob will accept, as even a dollar is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, I'm losing 20% of the value of my gains with each passing round.  Accepting this offer is a better strategy than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
