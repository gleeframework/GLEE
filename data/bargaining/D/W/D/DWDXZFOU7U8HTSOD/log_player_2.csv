"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. It's a very uneven split, and I have 11 rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 
I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This seems like a fair starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. Even though it's worth less due to inflation, it's still not a fair split. I have 9 rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 40/60 split.  I'm willing to give Alice a slight advantage, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation."
