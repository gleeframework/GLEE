"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a division of $90 for me and $10 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as it ensures Bob receives something while leaving the majority for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I propose to take $80 and leave $20 for Bob.  Since my gains are devalued by 20% each round, I need to increase my share to compensate. However, I'm still offering Bob a decent amount to incentivize acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is not great, it's important to consider the inflation and dwindling rounds. I am losing a significant amount of value each round, making this offer the best I can expect given the circumstances. Accepting will ensure I receive something, rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
