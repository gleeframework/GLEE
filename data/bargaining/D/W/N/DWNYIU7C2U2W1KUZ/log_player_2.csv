"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I want to make sure I get the lion's share.  This is a good starting point for a fair negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal before the value decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's find a more balanced split to account for the decreasing value on my end.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to account for the decreasing value of the money. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice is willing to compromise, the split is still not favorable enough for me, especially considering the decreasing value of the money on my end. I'll proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'd like to note that Alice's message seems to be incorrect - the decreasing value of the money affects me, not her. I'll take this into account when making my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still need a fairer split to account for the loss in value on my end.""}"
