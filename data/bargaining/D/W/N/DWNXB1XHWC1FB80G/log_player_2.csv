"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject the offer. I think I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation will work more against Alice than me in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  Since the inflation hurts you more than me, I think this is a fair offer that will allow us both to get something before the money loses too much value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but 55/45 is too far in your favor. This offer still gives you a decent share considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation is starting to hurt my potential gains significantly. Getting 42 is better than risking getting nothing at all."
