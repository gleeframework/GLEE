"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in Round 2, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll gain 400,000, but it's worth 80% of the original amount, which is 0.8 \* 400,000 = 320,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth 40% of its original value in Round 3 (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 256000,
  ""bob_gain"": 744000
}
```

I'm offering to take 25.6% of the original $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 74.4%."
