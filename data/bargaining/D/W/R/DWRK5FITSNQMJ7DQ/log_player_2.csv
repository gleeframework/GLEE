"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While Alice loses nothing over time, my share will quickly shrink in later rounds. I need to aim for a much larger portion."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I need a bigger share upfront to account for inflation. This offer is fair in the long run.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give up some of my share, but we need to make a deal soon before inflation erodes everything. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still not good enough! While Alice is becoming more reasonable, the deal is getting worse for me much faster than it's getting better for her.  I need to hold out for a better split, even if it means going into later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  This is my final offer â€“ let's be reasonable and close the deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but we need to reach an agreement quickly.  The longer we wait, the less we both get. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the best offer I'm likely to get at this point. The longer I wait, the more the inflation will eat into my share. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
