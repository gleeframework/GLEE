Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous offer, but still in my favor. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have an advantage in waiting, but I don't want to risk Bob getting too frustrated and deciding to wait it out, causing us both to lose. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."

Additionally, Bob is under increasing pressure due to inflation, which has already reduced the value of his potential gain by 27.1% compared to the first round. I expect him to become more desperate and make even more generous offers in the future. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.
