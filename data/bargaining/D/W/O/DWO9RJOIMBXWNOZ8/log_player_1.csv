"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
 I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a small share to incentivize him to accept.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While I'm not happy with the 1000/9000 split, I'm not ready to accept it yet.  Inflation is working against me, and if I reject, I get to make the next offer.  I'll try to find a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm offering 8100 for myself and 1900 for Bob.  Since my share is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to offer Bob a slightly larger share to make it more appealing.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in accepting this offer rather than risking another round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Although I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, I'm still not ready to accept a 2000/8000 split.  It's much worse than the previous round, and I'm hoping I can get a better deal by rejecting and making the offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm offering 7290 for myself and 2710 for Bob.  While inflation continues to eat away at my share, I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my gain and incentivizing Bob to accept.  I believe this offer is a good compromise that acknowledges the inflation factor while still being relatively favorable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm disappointed with the 3000/7000 split, I've lost a significant amount due to inflation, and I don't want to risk losing even more in the next round. I'm accepting this offer to minimize my losses."
