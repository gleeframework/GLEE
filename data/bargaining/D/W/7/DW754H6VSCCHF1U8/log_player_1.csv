"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both get less with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of money with each round, I think Bob's offer is a good compromise. I accept his proposal.
