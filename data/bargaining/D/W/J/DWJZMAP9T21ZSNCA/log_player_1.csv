Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Let's be fair and split the money more evenly, considering we both have an equal chance of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
