"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering future losses.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's worth considering that while Alice's offer seems fair now, with each round the money will lose value.  My share will be worth less, while Alice's will be worth much less. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the future loss of value. This ensures we both get a better deal than the previous offer.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing loss of value, let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice is offering a compromise, and while I'd prefer a more even split, the loss of value is significant.  Accepting this offer secures a decent share, and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential losses."
