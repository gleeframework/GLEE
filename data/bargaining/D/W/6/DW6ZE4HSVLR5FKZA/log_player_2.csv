Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  My offer in Round 1 was fair, and it's in both our interests to settle quickly. A 50/50 split is the most logical outcome here. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
