"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50-50 split, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly. In this round, $10,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $9,500.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
