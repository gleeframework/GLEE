Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair deal considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you want an even split, but the inflation makes it disadvantageous for me. This offer is a compromise.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight advantage to avoid further rounds and the potential for even greater inflation losses for me. This offer is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer in Round 4 is now reasonably close to my initial proposal and acknowledges the impact of inflation on his potential gains. Accepting this offer secures a decent share of the money for me and avoids the risk of further inflation erosion for both of us in subsequent rounds."
