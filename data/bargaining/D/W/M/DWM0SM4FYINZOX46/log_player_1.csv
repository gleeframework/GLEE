"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll take the smaller share, but it's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair start, hoping Bob will accept."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50-50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the 50-50 split, hoping to negotiate further and get a better deal for myself."

}
```

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll respond with:
