Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time to make a new proposal. Given the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time.
