"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $600,000 for herself and give $400,000 to Bob, with a message suggesting a fair split. The total amount still adds up to $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a fair split.  Let's both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, considering the 20% decrease in value for me due to inflation, I would effectively receive less than the face value of $400,000, making the split unfair from my perspective."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}\n\n###\n\nI take into account the 20% decrease in value for me and propose a split where I receive a larger share to compensate for the loss due to inflation, while still offering Bob a significant portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair share too. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (48.8% less), accepting this offer seems more reasonable. The difference in the split is not as significant when considering the effective value I would receive, and further rounds would only decrease the value further. It's better to accept this offer rather than risking an even less favorable outcome in the next rounds."
