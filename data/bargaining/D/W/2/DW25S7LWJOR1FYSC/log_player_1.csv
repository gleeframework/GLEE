"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm willing to give you a good share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'm hoping he'll see the reason in accepting this proposal to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer this way. Let's end this before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I've compromised, considering the inflation. Let's settle now""
}
```

I've reduced my share and increased Bob's share, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
