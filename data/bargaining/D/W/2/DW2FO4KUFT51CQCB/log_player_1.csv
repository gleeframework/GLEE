Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the total amount. I'm taking the remaining 60%."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since my gain is worth 10% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share now to compensate for the future loss in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the accelerated inflation, my gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll have to be cautious and think about the long-term consequences.

I'll accept this offer.
