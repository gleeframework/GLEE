"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's try 7-3! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The 20% inflation is biting already!

I don't like the 7-3 split, it's too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make another offer!

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, a fair and balanced deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting $5,000 and Bob getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, 55-45, but I'm not giving up! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but it's better than the 7-3 offer from last round. I'll consider it, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer.
