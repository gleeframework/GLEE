I'm going to try the same offer as before, but this time, I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to accept since I'm the one making the offer."

I'm sticking with my strategy - a tiny amount for Bob and the rest for me!  I'm hoping he'll realize that he'll get nothing if he keeps rejecting my offer."

This is getting ridiculous!  I'm taking what I can get at this point.  Even though my share is a tiny fraction of what it used to be, it's still better than nothing!"
