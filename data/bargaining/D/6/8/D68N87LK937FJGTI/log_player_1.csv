# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate more later! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'm hoping to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

Given the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be careful with my decision. I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4:
