"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem a bit lopsided, but consider the risk of inflation and the uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it.  The risk of inflation is real, but I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in the next round when I get to make the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
