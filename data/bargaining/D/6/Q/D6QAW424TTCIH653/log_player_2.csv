Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 90/10, I'll try to counter with a more favorable ratio. Here's my offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to adjust my calculations. Since Alice's offer is still quite skewed towards her gain, I'll try to counter with a more balanced offer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 70/30, I'll try to adjust my offer to a more even split. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
