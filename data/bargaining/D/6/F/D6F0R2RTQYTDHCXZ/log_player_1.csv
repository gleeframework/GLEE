Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair 40/60 split, but I think I deserve a larger share for taking the risk of negotiation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
