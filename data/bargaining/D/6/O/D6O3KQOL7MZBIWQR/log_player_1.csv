# Bob's message: Let's be fair and switch the roles this time. 60-40 for me, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I'm not comfortable with the 60-40 split going in his favor. I'd like to make a new proposal in the next round."
