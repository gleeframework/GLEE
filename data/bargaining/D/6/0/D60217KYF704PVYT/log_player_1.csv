"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll stick with my initial proposal.  While the value is decreasing, I'm confident that Bob will eventually accept a deal where he gets a smaller share, rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 850000 
# Bob gain: 150000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm confident I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to stick with my original proposal. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, and the closer we get to the deadline, the more likely he is to accept this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 880000 
# Bob gain: 120000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I recognize that inflation is working against me. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, unlike if we reach the 12th round and both of us get nothing.  It's a decent compromise considering the circumstances."
