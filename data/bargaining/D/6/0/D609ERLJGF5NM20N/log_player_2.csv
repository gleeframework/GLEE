"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money while it's still worth a lot, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to see if I can get a better deal.  The money is worth a lot less to me next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more this time because the money is worth less to me now. I think it's still a fair deal, though!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing, Bob. Let's settle this with a more balanced deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The money is losing value so quickly. I'd rather take this offer and get something than risk losing even more."
