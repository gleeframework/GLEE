"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This way, I'll get $400,000 and Bob will get $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $400,000 is now worth $360,000, and Bob's $600,000 remains the same.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I can get a better deal than this.
