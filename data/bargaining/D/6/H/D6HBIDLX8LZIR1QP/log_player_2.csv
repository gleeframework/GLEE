Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000,

""message"": ""That's a bit greedy Alice! How about this - I take a larger share, reflecting that the value decreases faster for me.  Let's be sensible.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I still need a significant portion. We need to find a balance here before the money becomes worthless. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving in the right direction, the deal still heavily favors her.  The rate of inflation hurts me faster, so holding out for a slightly better offer makes sense, even considering the decreasing value."
