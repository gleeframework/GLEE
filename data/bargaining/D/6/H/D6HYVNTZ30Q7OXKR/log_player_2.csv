Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal, but this delay is hurting us both. This offer is a compromise, let's finalize it. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While her offers are getting better for Bob, they are still not as good as they could be given how quickly the value of her share is declining.  Bob has time to wait for a more favorable offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 530000,
""alice_gain"": 470000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement in your offers. However, I need you to acknowledge the impact inflation is having on your share. This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob needs to start increasing the pressure on Alice. By offering her slightly less than half now, he is highlighting that the longer she waits, the less favorable the split will become for her.  This offer is designed to test her resolve and see how desperate she's getting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time!  I'm making a significant concession here. Let's close this deal now before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now bordering on acceptable.  The longer this goes on, the more Bob risks Alice panicking and offering a low amount out of desperation in the final rounds. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share considering the time pressure and potential for Alice to make a less favorable last-minute offer."
