"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This way, I get the majority and Bob gets something for his trouble. Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, and I know that if we go further, it will only get worse for me due to inflation.  I'll reject and try again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still taking the majority.  Hopefully Bob will realize that rejecting my offer again will only lead to him getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse with each round, and my options are diminishing quickly due to inflation. However, I'm still going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm getting desperate, but I still need to ensure I get a decent share of the money. I'll drop my offer slightly again, hoping Bob will see it's in his best interest to accept before the inflation hits him even harder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but it's still not enough.  I'm going to hold out for a better offer. The inflation is hurting him more than it's hurting me, and I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of this deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm still trying to get the best deal possible for myself, but I need to make a more substantial offer. I'm going to offer Bob 400,000, which is more than he has been offered previously. With the inflation hitting him harder, I think he might be willing to accept this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is a much better deal than I've been offered previously.  The inflation is really starting to affect Bob's offer, so I'll take what I can get at this point."
