"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, considering Bob gets nothing if we fail to agree. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not giving in that easily.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  Inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Inflation is really hurting now, but I'm not going to give in to Bob's demands. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45} 
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. Bob's last offer was getting closer to my ideal split, so I'm going to try to meet him halfway. Hopefully, he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really starting to bite, and Bob's offers are getting less generous. A 50/50 split is fair enough considering the circumstances. It's time to accept and get something out of this game."
