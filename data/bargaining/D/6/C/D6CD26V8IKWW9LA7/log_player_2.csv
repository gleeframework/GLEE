Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can find a more equitable split. Let's start with a closer division and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand you want a more equal split. Let's try 60/40.  This is a good compromise, and still allows us both to get a significant amount.  Let's get this done before inflation eats away too much. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
