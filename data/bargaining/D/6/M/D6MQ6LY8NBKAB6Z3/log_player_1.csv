"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

Alice's gain: $570,000 (5% less than $600,000)
Bob's gain: $630,000 (10% less than $700,000)

I'm not too thrilled about the smaller share, but I'll consider it. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: $350,000 / 0.854 (1 - 0.146) = $409,412 (14.26% less than $600,000)
Bob's gain: $650,000 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = $892,143 (27.1% less than $700,000)

I'm not thrilled about the smaller share, but I'll consider it. However, I think I can do better. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: $400,000 / 0.773 (1 - 0.227) = $517,415 (22.62% less than $600,000)
Bob's gain: $600,000 / 0.593 (1 - 0.407) = $1008,471 (40.95% less than $700,000)
