"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, I'm willing to meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the rejection!

Considering the inflation, my potential gain in this round is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to think carefully.

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think meeting in the middle is good enough, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 58% of the remaining amount, which is a bit more generous than the previous round. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to back down, meet me in the middle or I'll make you an even lower offer next time 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since I'm gaining 45% of the remaining amount, which is worth 48.8% less than the original $1,000,000, I'll calculate my actual gain:

45% of (1,000,000 * 0.848) = 382,400

Not a bad deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer, but I'm getting a bit worried that Bob might make a lower offer next time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'll give you a bit more. This is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 48% of the remaining amount, which is my best shot at getting a good deal. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
