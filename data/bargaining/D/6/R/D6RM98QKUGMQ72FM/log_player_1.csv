"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'll get 6000 dollars and Bob will get 4000 dollars. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 5000 is worth 90% of 6000, which is 5400. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. With inflation, my gain of 5000 is worth 90% of 5400, which is 4860. I'll propose a slightly better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in this round. In the first round, I proposed a gain of 6000. Due to inflation, my gain in this round is worth 27.1% of 6000, which is 1629. Since I proposed a gain of 5500 in the previous round, and now Bob is offering me 4800, I think I'm getting a better deal.

I'll accept this offer.
