"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to split it fairly.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. A 10% share is too low, especially considering the inflation will make this money worth less in the future if I wait. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you 40% of the money, which is a fair share considering the inflation we need to factor in.  Accept this and we can both walk away with a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  It's the fairest option considering the inflation we've both experienced. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While I'd prefer a larger share, I've already lost a significant amount due to inflation.  A 50/50 split is fair and I'm willing to settle for it."
