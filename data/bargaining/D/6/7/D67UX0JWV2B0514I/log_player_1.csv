"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This means I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my valuation of the offer accordingly.

In terms of the actual value of the money I'll get, Bob's offer is:

Alice gain: 20 * 0.8 (due to 20% inflation in the first round) = 16
Bob gain: 80 * 0.95 (due to 5% less inflation than me) = 76

This offer is quite lopsided, but I'll have to consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less in each round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This way, I'll try to get a larger share to make up for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the money I'll get, considering the inflation:

Alice gain: 10 * 0.512 (due to 48.8% inflation from the first round) = 5.12
Bob gain: 90 * 0.858 (due to 14.26% less inflation than me) = 77.22

This offer is extremely lopsided, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth less and less in each round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

This way, I'll try to get a larger share to make up for the inflation, but I'm also leaving some room for Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the money I'll get, considering the inflation:

Alice gain: 5 * 0.327 (due to 67.23% inflation from the first round) = 1.635
Bob gain: 95 * 0.778 (due to 22.62% less inflation than me) = 74.07

This offer is extremely lopsided, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is getting out of control! Since the money is worth less and less in each round, I'll make a new proposal that's even more aggressive.

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going for a high-risk, high-reward strategy, hoping that Bob will accept this offer before the money becomes worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting ridiculous! Let's calculate the actual value of the money I'll get, considering the inflation:

Alice gain: 1 * 0.208 (due to 79.03% inflation from the first round) = 0.208
Bob gain: 99 * 0.699 (due to 30.17% less inflation than me) = 69.01

This offer is laughable. I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me less than 1 cent. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm not going to get any more optimistic about the situation. The money is almost worthless at this point. Here's my proposal for Round 9:

{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm making a desperate attempt to salvage what's left of the situation. I'll take almost all the remaining money, hoping that Bob will accept this offer before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","The situation is hopeless. Let's calculate the actual value of the money I'll get, considering the inflation:

Alice gain: 0 * 0.136 (due to 86.58% inflation from the first round) = 0
Bob gain: 100 * 0.634 (due to 36.98% less inflation than me) = 63.4

I have no choice but to accept this offer, as I'll be left with nothing if I reject it. I'll take the tiny fraction of the remaining value.
