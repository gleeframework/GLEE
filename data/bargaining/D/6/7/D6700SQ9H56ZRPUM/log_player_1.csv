"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the new values.

For me, the $5,000 is worth 80% of the original $8,000 (20% less due to inflation), which is $4,000.
For Bob, the $5,000 is worth 95% of the original $5,200 (5% less due to inflation), which is $4,750.

Considering the new values, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather not accept a deal that's effectively worth $4,000 to me when I could potentially get more in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a bigger share last round, but I'm not giving it to you now. Take this and end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the new values due to inflation:

For me, the $6,000 from round 3 is worth 51.2% of the original $10,000 (48.8% less due to inflation), which is $3,120.
For Bob, the $4,000 from round 3 is worth 60.77% of the original $6,600 (14.26% less due to inflation), which is $3,973.

Considering the new values, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer because it's a relatively fair compromise, and I'd rather end the game now than risk getting less in future rounds."
