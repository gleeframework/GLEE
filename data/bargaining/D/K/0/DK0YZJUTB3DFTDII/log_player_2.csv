"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. This offer ensures you still receive a significant portion.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  It's crucial to get a deal done quickly. The longer the game goes on, the less the money will be worth to both of us, but especially to Bob who faces a 20% decrease per round.
* **Fairness:** While Alice's initial offer heavily favored her, a more equitable split is important for a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By making a reasonable offer, Bob increases the chances of Alice accepting and avoiding further rounds where the value deteriorates."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fairer deal now 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:** The value of the money has decreased significantly. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than risking further losses in future rounds.
* **Alice's Offer Improved:**  While still favoring Alice, her offer is closer to a balanced split than her initial proposal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in a future round carries a significant risk given the rapid inflation."
