Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite generous, but let's be realistic. How about a 60/40 split? This way we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
