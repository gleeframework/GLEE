Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better.  Let's split the difference on this round.  I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm also mindful of the inflation factor.  This is a fair and reasonable offer that will allow us both to leave with a significant amount of money. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
