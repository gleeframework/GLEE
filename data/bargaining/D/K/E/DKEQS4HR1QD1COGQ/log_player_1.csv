"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end the game here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is making the money worth less and less!

I'm not sure I want to meet Bob halfway, as he's gaining the same amount as me, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less, I'd rather try to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit more, but I'm still in control!""
}
```

I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if he'll accept!"

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking its toll! Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm not ready to give up control just yet. I'll try to hold on to a bit more of the money.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money continuing to lose value, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""You're getting the majority, but I'm still walking away with something!""
}
```
