I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer, even with the inflation factor.  I'm hoping he'll realize that he needs to be more generous in the next round if he wants to get any money at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower amount than my first offer, but still a significantly higher amount than what he offered me.  I think he's starting to get the idea that he needs to be more reasonable if he wants to get any money at all."
