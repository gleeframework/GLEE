I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob just $1.  This is a classic strategy in ultimatum games, as even though it's not fair, people are often averse to getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I'm averse to getting nothing, I'm not going to accept a measly $1 while Bob gets $999,999. I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest offer and it shows a willingness to compromise.  Hopefully, Bob will accept this and we can avoid any further rounds."
