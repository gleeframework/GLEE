"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but so do I. Let's be fair and meet in the middle. This offer is better for me than your last, and it still gives you a significant share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now. While her offer is better than her last, it's still skewed in her favor.  I'm willing to gamble another round to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split (or even better)."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close!  Let's compromise â€“ this split is almost right down the middle and saves us both from further losses."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time!  This offer is a compromise and it's better for you than my last. Don't let inflation eat away at our potential gains any further! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Time pressure is now a significant factor. While the split isn't ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds. Alice is clearly feeling the inflation pinch and unlikely to offer more. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout."
