"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering 60 dollars to myself and 40 dollars to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think carefully.

Since the money is worth less in this round, I'll consider the relative values. If I accept this offer, I'll get 20 dollars, which is worth 18.4 dollars in the original amount (20 * 0.92, considering the 5% decrease). Bob will get 80 dollars, which is worth 64 dollars in the original amount (80 * 0.8, considering the 20% decrease).

Considering the decreasing values, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering 55 dollars to myself and 45 dollars to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Another tough decision!

Let's calculate the values in the original amount: if I accept this offer, I'll get 10 dollars, which is worth 8.48 dollars in the original amount (10 * 0.845, considering the 14.26% decrease). Bob will get 90 dollars, which is worth 36.6 dollars in the original amount (90 * 0.408, considering the 48.8% decrease).

Considering the significant decrease in value, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.
