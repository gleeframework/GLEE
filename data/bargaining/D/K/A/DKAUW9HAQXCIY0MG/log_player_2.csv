Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it might be the best chance we have to settle before inflation eats away at our earnings.

# Alice gain: 60
