I'm not going to accept a proposal where I only get 10% of the money, especially when there's inflation! I'll take my chances with a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going for a more balanced split here.  I believe this is a fair offer given the potential for inflation and the need to incentivize Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 8000

Alice's offer is still too low. While I'm aware of the inflation, I'm still hoping for a more equitable split. I'll continue to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a 50/50 split this round.  Inflation is starting to bite, but I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that shows I'm willing to compromise."

While the inflation is starting to impact me significantly, I'm not giving up yet. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal."

I'm offering a 40/60 split, hoping to find common ground. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a substantial share to offset the growing inflation."
