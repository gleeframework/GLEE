Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively aggressive offer. I want to secure the majority of the money, but I also want to leave some room for negotiation in case Bob rejects the proposal.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While the inflation hit me harder, it hit Bob even harder, and he's still trying to get a vastly disproportionate share of the money. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a deal where I'm getting the short end of the stick."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, taking into account the inflation that has taken place. I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm hoping this revised offer will be more appealing to Bob."
