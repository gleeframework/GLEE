Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my previous offer. 50/50 is the most equitable way to divide the money. Let's avoid further losses and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even with inflation, accepting 500,000 now is a bad deal for me in the long run.  I need to try and steer Bob towards a more favorable outcome while there's still time."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every passing round.  Let's end this now and split the money evenly.  It's the only logical solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

This is a tough spot. While I'd ideally want more, the impact of inflation is becoming too significant. Accepting 500,000 now is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
