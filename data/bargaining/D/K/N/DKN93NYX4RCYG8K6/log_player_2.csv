"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value for me faster. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what kind of offer I can get in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate difference.  Let's work together to get this done quickly!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to adjust my initial proposal, but a 60/40 split in your favor is too much. This offer still acknowledges the inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take this offer than risk getting less in the next round.  Let's get this done!"
