"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I need a bit more for myself""}

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a larger share, but I still need to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm still the one who's getting the better deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While 40 is a decent share, I'm not sure it's enough considering the reduced value of my potential gain.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 25, ""bob_gain"": 75, ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I need a bit to survive""}

I'm willing to give Bob a large share, but I need to get something for myself to survive."
