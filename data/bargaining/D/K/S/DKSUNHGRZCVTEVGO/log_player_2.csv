Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, 50/50 isn't fair anymore. This is a better compromise 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that a 50/50 split is less appealing to me now due to inflation, her offer of 43/57 is still not in my best interest. The rate of inflation is hurting me quickly, but I need to hold out for a better deal in the hopes that Alice will become more agreeable as the rounds progress."

Round 6

{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this soon! This offer is a compromise, and it's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing money fast, I'm being generous here, take it before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is correct that I am losing money rapidly due to inflation, but her offer is still tilted in her favor. While the difference seems small, I believe holding out for one or two more rounds might push her closer to a 50/50 split, especially since she's emphasizing the shrinking pot from her perspective. The next few rounds will be crucial to see if she's willing to make a more substantial compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my previous offer.  Let's be realistic, the clock is ticking and we both lose if this falls apart.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** At this stage, I need to balance appearing firm with showing a willingness to compromise. Repeating my previous offer of 48/52 demonstrates that I'm willing to accept slightly less than half, while also highlighting the urgency of the situation. It's a gamble, but hopefully, Alice will see the value in a guaranteed win rather than risking everything on a slightly larger share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're running out of time and money, this is your last chance to get something worthwhile 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** The game has taken a turn for the worse.  While 44/56 isn't a good split, it's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to budge further. With the inflation rate eating into my potential gains with each passing round, I'm now in a position where delaying further could lead to a worse outcome. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting this offer is the most logical choice in this unfavorable situation."
