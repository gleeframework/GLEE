Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting, let's adjust accordingly 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it, Alice.  Inflation is a real concern, and this seems like a fair compromise."
