"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This way, I get 60% of the original amount, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, I'm effectively getting 55% of the original amount, which is more than I got in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
