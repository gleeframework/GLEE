"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept it."
