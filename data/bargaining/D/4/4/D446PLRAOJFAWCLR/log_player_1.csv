"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a pretty generous offer, considering I could just keep all the money for myself.  But I want to see if Bob is willing to work together."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer, and the inflation means it's even worse than it looks. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to adjust my offer to reflect the inflation and Bob's previous offer.  I'm still offering him a share, but I need to protect myself too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but the inflation is also hitting hard. It's a tough choice, but I think I can still get a better deal by rejecting and proposing again.  The next round's inflation is going to be brutal, but I'm willing to risk it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

Inflation is really kicking in now, so I'm going to try to lock in a deal that's still favorable to me, but also gives Bob a chance to get something.  I'm cutting my previous offer down a bit, but I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. The inflation is really starting to hurt, and Bob's offer is still pretty bad.  But, I think it's better than getting nothing at all. If I reject and propose again, I risk the chance of getting nothing. A 50/50 split is better than the potential for getting zero."
