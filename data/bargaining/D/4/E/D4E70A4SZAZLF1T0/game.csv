800000.0,200000.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $800,000, you take $200,000. This is a great offer for you considering the money will be worth less if you wait.",Alice,1,

700000.0,300000.0,"Okay, how about this: I get $700,000 and you get $300,000.  Remember, the clock is ticking and the value is going down - better to take a good deal now.",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, we need to close this deal soon. I'm proposing a compromise: $550,000 for me, and $450,000 for you. This is a fair offer considering the time constraint and the decreasing value. Let's not risk walking away with nothing!",Alice,7,
