Let's see if Bob is a fair player.  I'm offering him $1000 and keeping the rest.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the 5000 now than risk getting nothing. The inflation is going to hurt my gains more than his."
