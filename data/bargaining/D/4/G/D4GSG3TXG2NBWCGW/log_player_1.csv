"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, but Bob's offer is a 50-50 split. I'll take it.
