"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain remains the same, I'll accept the offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
