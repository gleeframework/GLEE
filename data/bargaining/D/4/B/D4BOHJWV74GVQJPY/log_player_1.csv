"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm looking for a better deal. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation. Since the offer is a 50-50 split, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, so I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm looking for a bit more. Your turn, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to hurt!

In Round 4, I'm faced with an even worse deal than before. However, I don't want to risk going to Round 5, where the money will be worth even less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, even though I'm not thrilled about it. At least I'll get some money, even if it's not as much as I wanted."
