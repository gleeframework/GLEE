"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. I want to maximize my share in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's true that the money I'd gain is worth less due to inflation, I'm still better off getting $100,000 than nothing. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
``` 

I'll offer Bob $550,000 and keep $450,000 for myself.  Since inflation is a factor, I want to secure a larger share than the previous round, but also need to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept."
