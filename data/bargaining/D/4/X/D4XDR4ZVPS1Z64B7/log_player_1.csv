"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take the lion's share, but I'll give you a decent chunk too. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. The message is a friendly one, but also a bit cheeky!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think it's a fair start. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a counteroffer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, Bob! I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $420,000 and Bob gets $580,000. The message is a bit cheeky, but also a bit of a warning shot across the bow!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. You can't have it all, Alice!

# Bob gain: 650000

}
```
