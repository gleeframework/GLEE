"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor. I'll give you a chance to accept or reject.""
}
```

This way, I get a slightly larger share, but it's still a reasonable offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm still looking for a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $2,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000. It's not a bad offer, but I was hoping for more.

However, I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse deal. The money is worth 10% less for me, and I'm not sure if I can afford to wait.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
