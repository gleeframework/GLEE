"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it was fair, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me! 

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision accordingly. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again!

Considering the 20% inflation, the money is worth 80% of its original value. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I don't lose too much value.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, which is a bit more skewed towards Bob, but I'm trying to be reasonable considering the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
