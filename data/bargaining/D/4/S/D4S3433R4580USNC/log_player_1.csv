"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves a small amount for Bob. I'm hoping this is enough to incentivize him to accept, as the money will become increasingly less valuable for him with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, the money is becoming less valuable for Bob with each passing round.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant sum, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing at all if we continue to reject each other's offers."
