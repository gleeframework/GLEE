"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a pretty standard starting point, with me getting a slight edge. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not satisfied with the terms, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the changing value of the money due to inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
