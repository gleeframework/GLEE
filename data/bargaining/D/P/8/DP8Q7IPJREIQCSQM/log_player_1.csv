"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves a reasonable amount for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round, as the value of the money will decrease in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I proposed in the first round, even taking inflation into account.  I believe I can still get a better deal, so I'll reject and make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly from the first round, reflecting the inflation on Bob's side.  While it's not as much as I hoped for, I believe this offer is still fair considering the value of the money is decreasing.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further inflation and potential loss of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his last offer, it's still considerably lower than my first offer, even accounting for inflation. I'm determined to get a fairer share, and I believe I can still achieve that by making my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}
```

This offer reflects the significant inflation we've experienced. I've lowered my desired amount slightly to account for the decreasing value, but I'm still aiming for a share that is fair considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with the offer, the continued inflation is making it increasingly difficult to secure a better deal.  This offer is at least closer to a fair split than Bob's previous offers, and accepting it will prevent further losses due to inflation."
