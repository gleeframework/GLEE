"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10% 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 1000 dollars is something, it's a very small portion of the total. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be more equitable.  I'll take 60% and you take 40%, a fairer split than before.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%.  Let's split it 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than I hoped for."
