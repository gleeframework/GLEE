"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but you get a small share. Hopefully, you'll accept and we can end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhy would I accept such a low offer on the first round? I have 11 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. Besides, with inflation, the money is worth more now than it will be later, so I'm not too concerned about the decrease in value... yet! Let's see what I can counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try a more even split, considering I have the upper hand with more rounds to go and inflation on my side.""}\n\nI'm hoping to create a sense of urgency with Alice, while also showing that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. By offering her a significant amount, I'm giving her the opportunity to accept a decent offer before the money loses too much value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up more than 30% of the potential money. If you reject this, I'll be forced to play more aggressively. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial one, I still believe I can negotiate for a more favorable split. The threat of playing more aggressively doesn't intimidate me, as I'm confident in my ability to adapt and counteroffer. Additionally, although the money's value is decreasing, I think the potential gain is worth the risk of continuing the game. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's end this before the money loses too much value.""}\n\nI'm trying to appear more conciliatory while still pushing for a better deal. By offering a 55-45 split, I'm hoping to create a sense of compromise and encourage Alice to accept. The decreasing value of the money is starting to become a concern, so I want to wrap up the negotiations soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. This is the best offer you'll get from me. Remember, inflation is hurting us both, and the longer we wait, the less money we each get. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice's offer is closer to the middle, I'm still not convinced it's the best I can get. With 7 rounds left, I believe I have time to negotiate further and potentially get an even better deal. The effects of inflation are becoming more significant, but I'm willing to take the risk to maximize my gain. I'll try to counteroffer again and see how Alice responds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""I see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to shave off a bit more from my share, but I still think I deserve the larger portion. Let's settle this before the money loses even more value.""}\n\nI'm attempting to create a sense of progress and momentum in the negotiations by incrementally decreasing my proposed share. By offering a 52.5-47.5 split, I'm hoping to make Alice feel like we're close enough to a mutually acceptable deal that she'll be willing to accept. The pressure of inflation is mounting, so I want to conclude the negotiations soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. We're both losing money with each round, and it's getting ridiculous. Let's be reasonable and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nFinally! An offer I can live with. With the money's value decreasing rapidly, I think it's wise to accept the 50-50 split. I've negotiated hard to get to this point, and I don't think I can get a significantly better deal. Alice's message about being reasonable resonates with me, and I agree that it's time to end this game. I'll accept the offer and walk away with $5,000, even if it is worth less than it was at the start."
