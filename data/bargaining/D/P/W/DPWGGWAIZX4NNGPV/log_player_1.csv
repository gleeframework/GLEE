"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the offer first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9500, ""bob_gain"": 500}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to 9500, but still leaving Bob with a small portion.  Inflation is likely to continue, and I want to secure a larger share before it gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, even though he's getting a bigger share.  It's worth trying to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9750, ""bob_gain"": 250}
```

Inflation is impacting Bob more than me, so I'm going to push for a higher share.  9750 for me is a significant gain, but I'm willing to risk it for a higher return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is getting increasingly favorable to him due to inflation. Accepting now is the best course of action to secure a reasonable share."
