Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and then we can reevaluate our positions later in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too generous, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since my money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself.""}

I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer, taking a slightly smaller share to try to get Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, but I'm willing to give you a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! With my money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still not great, but I'm running out of options.
