"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose a 999,999/1 split in my favor. This is a very lopsided offer, but since we're playing against each other, I'm taking the risk that Bob will accept it to avoid any potential inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more money, Bob's offer is still significantly better than what I would have gained if I had rejected his offer and then proposed my own in the next round.  With the inflation, I know I wouldn't be able to get anywhere near the 999,999 I was hoping for."
