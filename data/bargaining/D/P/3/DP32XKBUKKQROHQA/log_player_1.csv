Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more realistic split that reflects the fact that I'll be making the later offers if we don't agree now.  This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
