""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't accept anything less than 600,000.  Remember, with each round, the money is worth less. This is the fairest deal for us both before inflation makes it even more difficult.

# Alice gain: 600000
