"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that I get $9000 and Bob gets $1000. This is a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation and the fact that I'm the one taking the initiative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This offer reflects the increased risk of inflation and gives Bob a fair chance to get a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

This is getting risky. I'm not going to settle for such a small share, especially as the inflation is starting to bite for Bob.  I'll keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still holding out for a significant portion. With the inflation hitting Bob harder, I'm betting he'll be more likely to accept this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Bob is getting greedy, but I'm not going to give in yet.  The inflation is starting to hurt him more, and I'm still holding out for a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm making a significant concession, but I'm still trying to secure a majority of the funds.  We're running out of time, and the risk of inflation is starting to impact both of us."
