"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I think I deserve more for being the one to start the negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 100,000 is a decent amount, it's worth exploring if a better deal can be struck, especially considering inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair and mutually beneficial way to divide the money. Let's be reasonable and end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a larger share for taking the risk of negotiating first. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her first offer, it's still significantly less than what I offered in the previous round. I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives me such a small share, especially given the inflation factor. I believe a better compromise is possible."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to increase my offer to a 45/55 split. This is a fair and reasonable compromise, considering the inflation we're both facing. Let's reach an agreement and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve the majority of the money considering the initial proposal and the previous rejections. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable, particularly considering the inflation we're experiencing. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially after making several compromises. I'm confident that a more equitable agreement can be reached."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but 60/40 is the best I can do with this amount of inflation.  Let's find a way to agree and end this game. We're both losing money with each round.""}
