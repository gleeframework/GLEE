Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'm confident that I can still get a good share of the money, even with the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer is far less than my initial proposal, it's still a significant amount of money. Considering the inflation rate, and the risk of getting nothing at all if we continue, it's wise to accept this offer."
