Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to account for the inflation, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's try 57-43. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, her concessions are still too small.  We need to push her further to get a more favorable split before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4600, ""alice_gain"": 5400, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out and we're both losing money. This is my final offer - it's a 54/46 split in your favor. Let's end this before inflation hurts us both more.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:** Offering 46% is a slight concession from the previous round (44%), signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Urgency:** Emphasize the time constraint and the fact that both parties are losing due to inflation. 
* **Finality:**  Presenting this as a ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Alice to accept before the deal potentially worsens for her."
