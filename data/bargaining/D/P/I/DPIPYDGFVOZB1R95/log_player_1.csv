Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 80/20 is a more reasonable split, considering the uncertainty is still high, but I'm willing to give you a larger share than I initially thought. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
