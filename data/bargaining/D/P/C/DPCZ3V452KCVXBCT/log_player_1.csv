"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going for a strong opening offer.  I'm assuming Bob will be more likely to accept a slightly less favorable offer in the early rounds than risk getting nothing if we run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is less favorable to me than my initial offer. I'm willing to risk going to the next round, as inflation is currently only affecting Bob's gains. I want to see if I can secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, hoping Bob will recognize that he's losing more and more with each round due to inflation.  I'm still leaving him with a decent portion, but trying to maximize my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as my previous offer.  Even though inflation is impacting Bob significantly,  I'm not sure if I can secure a better deal. It's a good deal for me, and I'm willing to take it."
