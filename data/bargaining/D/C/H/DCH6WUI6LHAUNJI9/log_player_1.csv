"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but it's still a decent offer. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 70-30 split, especially considering the inflation. I was hoping for a better deal, especially since the money I gain is worth less now. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share this time. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""}

I'm trying to be more flexible and offer a slightly more generous split, hoping Bob will accept it."
