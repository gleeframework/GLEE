"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still a fair amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given our current circumstances.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll reject this offer, since it's exactly the same as my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to give in so easily.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still need to get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
