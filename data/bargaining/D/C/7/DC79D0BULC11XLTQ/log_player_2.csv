While Alice's offer is framed as ""fair,"" it's slightly biased in her favor.  I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in a later round, even with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""I understand you want to be fair, so I'm proposing a split that's a little closer to even. Let's not lose too much to inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is moving closer to a 50/50 split, and further rounds risk significant losses to inflation. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount."
