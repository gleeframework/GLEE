Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I'm willing to concede a bit more to avoid further rounds, but 45/55 is the best I can do.  It's fair given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
