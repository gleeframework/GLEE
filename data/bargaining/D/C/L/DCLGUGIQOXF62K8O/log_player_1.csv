Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer Alice, but how about a 60/40 split in my favor? This accounts for the decreasing value of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
