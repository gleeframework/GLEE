"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  I know it's tempting to wait for a better deal, but remember inflation will hurt you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal, knowing that inflation will hit me harder. I'll risk it and see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I know inflation is a factor, Alice, but I'm hoping we can find a more balanced split that benefits us both. Let's try this - I'll take 55, and you keep 45. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal. This offer is a compromise, and it's the best you'll get considering the rapid inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a higher gain, it's clear that I'm losing value faster than Alice due to the inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, whereas rejecting it might lead to a worse outcome in the next round."
