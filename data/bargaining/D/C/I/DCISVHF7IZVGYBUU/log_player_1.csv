Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know inflation is a factor, Alice, but I'm hoping we can find a more balanced split that benefits us both. Let's try this - I'll take 55, and you keep 45. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
