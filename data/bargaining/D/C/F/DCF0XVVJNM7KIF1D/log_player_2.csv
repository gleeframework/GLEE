"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is not fair, how about 55/45?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the same.  It seems fair to me and it's clear you won't get a better deal in further rounds with the way inflation is hitting your returns. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I'll accept the offer. With inflation reducing the value of the money in each round, it's likely that further rounds will only decrease the value of the money I can gain. Accepting the 60/40 split now seems like the best option."
