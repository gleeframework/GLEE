Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Time is running out Alice! This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling the pressure of inflation. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the inflation is significantly impacting Alice. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting $550,000 prevents further losses for both of us.
