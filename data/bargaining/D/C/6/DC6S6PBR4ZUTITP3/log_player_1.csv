"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in an 80-20 ratio, with me receiving 80 dollars. This offers a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is fair given the diminishing value of the money for me. This allows us both to get a decent amount, and avoids further risk of losing value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
