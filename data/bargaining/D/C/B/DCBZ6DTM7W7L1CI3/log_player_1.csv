"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected 50/50, so I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the rejection! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'm not too thrilled about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make another proposal!

Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was a bit too aggressive, I'll try to offer a compromise. I'll give Bob a slightly higher share, but still keep a decent amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a sweet spot!""
}
```

Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting lower, I'm getting higher, let's see if you'll meet my price! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive! With the inflation rate being 27.1% less for Bob, his gain is worth a significant amount less than in the first round. I'll need to think carefully about this one.

Considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about giving up more than 50% of the total amount. However, I don't want to risk going into further rounds, so I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or not.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's time for me to make another proposal! Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was quite aggressive, I'll try to take a firmer stance this time.

I'll offer a smaller share to Bob, hoping that he'll accept this one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing it too hard, let's find a fair middle ground!""
}
```

Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
