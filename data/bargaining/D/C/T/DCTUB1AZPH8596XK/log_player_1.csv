Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the value of money decreases with each round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable.  This offer still gives you a good share, and time is running out - which hurts you more than me.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think my previous offer was fair.  Let's come to an agreement before the value of our money drops further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but he's still trying to secure a larger share.  While his offer is closer to a compromise, accepting now would give me significantly less of the initial value compared to him. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
