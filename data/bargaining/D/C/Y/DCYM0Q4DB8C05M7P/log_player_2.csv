"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10.  I think it's a fair starting point, what do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The 90/10 split isn't quite fair for me, and I think I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Plus, the inflation rate for me is higher, so I want to try to get a better offer before the money loses more value. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 45/55 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation rates. We both get a significant amount, and it's a good compromise.""}"
