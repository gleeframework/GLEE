"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep most of the money 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money is worth less now. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the lead, but I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still gives Bob a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the current circumstances. I'll take the 55/45 split and hope that the value of the money holds up for a bit longer."
