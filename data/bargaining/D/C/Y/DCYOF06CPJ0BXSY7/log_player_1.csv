"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. I've included a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Since the money loses value with each passing round, I'm hoping Bob will be motivated to accept my offer and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's split it more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less to both of us due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since the money loses more value for Bob than for me, I'm hoping to use this to my advantage in the next round. I'll make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Take it before it's too late""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself. Since the money is losing value quickly, especially for Bob, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency with my message ""Take it before it's too late"". I'm hoping Bob will accept my offer rather than risk losing even more value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise.  This offer is fairer than the previous round, considering the inflation.  Let's end this game now. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Although I previously rejected a similar offer, the effects of inflation have changed the situation. With the money losing 14.26% of its value for me and 48.8% for Bob, this offer is more favorable to me than it initially seems. Considering the significant loss of value for Bob, I believe this offer is a good compromise, and it's better to end the game now rather than risking further devaluation."
