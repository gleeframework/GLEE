"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I've included a message saying ""Let's be reasonable"" in the hopes that Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it, ending the game. If Bob rejects, the game will continue, and he'll make the next proposal. Remember, with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less to Bob due to inflation, which might encourage him to accept a deal sooner rather than later. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome. This is my offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although he's trying for a more balanced outcome, I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor that affects Bob's gains but not mine. I'm hoping that as the rounds continue, Bob will be more inclined to accept a deal that's slightly less favorable to him due to the decreasing value of his potential gains. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my share to $650,000 and offering Bob $350,000. Given that the money is worth 10% less to Bob with each passing round, I'm reminding him to consider the impact of inflation on his potential gains. The longer we negotiate, the less the money is worth to him, so I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing, especially with the message to consider the inflation factor. Let's see how Bob responds to this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer. Given that he's described this as his final offer and considering the terms, I believe this is a reasonable deal. I'll gain $520,000, and Bob will gain $480,000, which, due to inflation, is actually worth less than its face value. Since the money's value to me remains constant, and Bob is eager to wrap things up, I think it's wise to accept this offer and conclude the game. Continuing further might risk pushing Bob to offer less favorable terms or walking away, so I'll take the $520,000 as a satisfactory outcome. {""decision"": ""accept""}"
