# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split might seem fair, but considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, I'd rather try to get a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 50/50 split is the best option, especially since the money is worth less than half of its original value. I'd like to try to negotiate for a slightly better share."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
