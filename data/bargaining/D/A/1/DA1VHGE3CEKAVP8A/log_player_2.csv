Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's cut our losses and split the difference. This is my final offer - we can't afford to keep going back and forth.  
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but her offer is still not favorable. With each rejection, the pressure on her increases more than on me due to the inflation working against her.  I'm hoping she'll make a significant jump in the next round to salvage a deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be real. The clock is ticking, and your share is losing value fast. I'm offering a straight 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it - this is the most equitable outcome we'll get at this point.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. By offering a 50/50 split, I'm calling Alice's bluff and highlighting the diminishing value of her potential gains.  This puts the pressure squarely on her to accept a fair deal or risk walking away with significantly less."
