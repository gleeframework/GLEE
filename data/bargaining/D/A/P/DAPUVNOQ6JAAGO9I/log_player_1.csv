"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Since Bob's offer is still a significant amount, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30% share, especially with the money being worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still need to get a decent amount. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but still keep a reasonable amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to be cautious with the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is still a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best deal, and I'd rather wait for a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 21.51% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more generous, but I need a fair share. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and getting a reasonable amount, considering the inflation."
