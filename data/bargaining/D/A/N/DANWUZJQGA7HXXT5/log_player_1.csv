Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm going to try and get a bit more than last round. I think 8100 is a fair offer, given the inflation and the fact that Bob just tried to take 9000 for himself.  Let's see what he says!"

I'm still holding out for a good deal, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.  I'm offering 7290, which is still a good chunk of the money, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit more if necessary."

Bob's getting really greedy!  I'm not going to let him take 7000 of the money. I'll make my own offer next round, and see if we can come to a more reasonable agreement."
