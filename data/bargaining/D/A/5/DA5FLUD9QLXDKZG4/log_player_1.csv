"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 4:1 ratio, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering the initial offer was too skewed towards you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $3200.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal for me, considering the money is worth less now. However, I don't want to reject it and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. So, I'll accept this offer.
