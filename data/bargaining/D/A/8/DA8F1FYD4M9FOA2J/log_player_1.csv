"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation factor. Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 60/40 split in his favor, which is actually a worse deal for me than my initial offer. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. I'll take that into account in my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a 60/40 split, but that's too high for me. I'll meet you halfway with 55/45.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but still a bit more generous than Bob's offer in the previous round. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
