"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original amount, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Considering the inflation, I think Bob's offer is a good one, and I'll accept it.
