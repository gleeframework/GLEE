Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, aiming to get the most possible in the first round. Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm assuming he might be more willing to take a small amount rather than risk getting nothing in a later round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it seems like a crazy offer, I'm holding out for a better deal.  The inflation only affects Bob's gain, so I'm hoping he'll come back with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced deal this time, giving Bob a larger share.  While the inflation only affects Bob's side, I want to avoid further rounds of rejection and secure a deal quickly.  A 90/10 split seems fair, considering the potential risk of going further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's an improvement from the last round, I'm hoping to secure a better deal for myself. The inflation is clearly impacting Bob more than me, and I think he'll come back with a more generous offer in the next round. I'm confident I can get a bigger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split again. Bob has been getting a smaller and smaller share due to inflation, so I'm hoping this offer will be attractive. The inflation is making it riskier for him to keep rejecting offers, and I think this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation is really starting to hit Bob hard, and the risk of further rejection and getting even less is too high.  Taking 200,000 is better than the potential of getting nothing at all."
