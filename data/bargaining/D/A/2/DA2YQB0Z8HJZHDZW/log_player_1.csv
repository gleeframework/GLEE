"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but also leaves room for negotiation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair offer, and since the money is losing value with each round, it's better to accept now rather than risk getting a worse offer in the next round."
