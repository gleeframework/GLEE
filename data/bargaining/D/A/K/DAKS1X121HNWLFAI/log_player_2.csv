"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it almost equally 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, 
""alice_gain"": 4000, 
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, take it or leave it. It'll only get worse for you next round.""}
``` 
 
Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:** Alice's money is devaluing much faster than Bob's. Bob can leverage this time pressure to his advantage.
* **Appearing Generous (But Not Really):** The message is crafted to sound generous on the surface, but the underlying threat is clear. This might make Alice more likely to accept, thinking she's getting a decent deal considering the rapid devaluation. 
* **Future Leverage:**  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob is in a strong position in the next round. The value difference will be even more significant, giving Bob more negotiating power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, but it's still a good deal for you 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Here's why:

* **Alice is hurting:** The rapid devaluation is clearly pushing Alice to make concessions. She's now willing to take even less than her initial offer.
* **Bob's position is strong:**  While Bob's potential gains are also shrinking, they're doing so at a much slower rate. He can afford to be patient.
* **Final round gamble:** If Bob rejects this offer, the game will likely go to the final round where Bob has full control. While the total amount will be smaller, he can propose to keep the vast majority of it knowing Alice's options are extremely limited by the devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, 
""alice_gain"": 1000, 
""message"": ""This is your last chance, Alice. Take it before it's worth nothing.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** This is the last round, and Alice has no further moves.  Bob can now dictate terms.
* **Maximum Gain:**  While the total value has shrunk, Bob aims to maximize his own share knowing Alice is desperate to salvage anything.
* **Bluff:** The message implies the entire $10,000 will disappear if Alice rejects the offer. This is a bluff, but it plays on the existing pressure and might make Alice more likely to accept even this highly unfavorable deal."
