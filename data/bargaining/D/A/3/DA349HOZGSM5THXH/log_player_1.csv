Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way, we both get a decent amount before inflation kicks in. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""That's a tempting offer, Bob, but I think we can do better. Let's see what the next round brings."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Advantage:** Time is on my side (Alice's side). Bob's money is losing value much faster than mine. The longer we wait, the more desperate he'll become for a deal, and the better the offer I can secure.
* **Initial Offer Leverage:** My initial offer of $6,000 for myself established a benchmark. By rejecting Bob's even split, I'm signaling that I'm aiming for a larger share. 
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk that Bob becomes too stubborn, but I'm willing to gamble a few rounds, given the inflation disparity."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, how about this?  I'm increasing my offer to give you a chance to cash out before inflation eats away more of your share.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:**  I'm slightly increasing my offer to show some flexibility and make Bob consider the deal seriously.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm emphasizing the time pressure and how inflation is working against him. The message aims to make him doubt his negotiating position.
* **Strategic Retreat (Slight):** I don't want to seem greedy, but I'm not backing down significantly. I believe Bob will be more receptive after his offer was rejected."
