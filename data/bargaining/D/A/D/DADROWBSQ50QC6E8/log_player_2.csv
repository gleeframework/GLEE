Alice's offer:

This offer is far too unfair, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5}
```

I'm going to propose a fair deal, with me taking the majority share.  While I acknowledge that the game is about division, I'm also trying to be realistic about the value of money decreasing with each round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is slightly better than the first round, it's still not fair. I'm holding out for a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 85, ""alice_gain"": 15}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm still going to prioritize securing a larger share for myself.  It's important to maximize my gains before the value of the money continues to decline."
