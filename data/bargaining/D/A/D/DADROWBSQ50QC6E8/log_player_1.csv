"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly.  Since the money loses value with each round, it's in my best interest to get this over with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems tempting to take the $5, remember that I'm playing against an opponent who knows how inflation is affecting me, and I don't know how it's impacting him.  If I accept, I'm essentially giving him control of the game, and there's a risk he'll propose something even worse for me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob slightly, to $10.  This is still a good deal for me, as I'll be getting the vast majority of the money. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as each round that passes puts me at a greater disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  While it's not ideal, I've seen Bob's tactics. He's willing to let the game continue, putting me at a greater disadvantage with each round.  I'm not sure if he's aware of how inflation is affecting me, but taking the $15 now is the safest option. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
