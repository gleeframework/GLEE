"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a classic game theory scenario with elements of declining value. While Alice's offer seems generous at face value, it significantly favors her.  Here's why I reject:

* **Future Leverage:**  By rejecting, I signal that I'm not willing to accept an uneven deal. As the rounds progress, Alice's position weakens due to the 20% depreciation, making her more likely to offer a larger share in future rounds.
* **Time Value:** Even though the money depreciates for me, getting a larger share later is better than accepting a smaller share now. 

I'm aiming to secure a deal closer to a 50/50 split, or at least a significantly improved offer from Alice."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""My turn, Alice. I'm proposing a more balanced split that reflects the time pressure we both face.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but Fair:** This offer is a strong opening move from my side, demonstrating I'm serious about getting a larger share while still leaving a substantial amount for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:** By round 2, the value for Alice has already decreased.  Offering her a bit less than half now might seem appealing compared to risking further depreciation. 
* **Setting the Tone:**  This offer sets a firm tone for future negotiations. It indicates that I'm aiming for a more equitable split than her initial proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less than before, but still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is slightly better, but still not good enough. Here's why:

* **Slow Concession:** Alice's offer only moved down 80,000. This suggests she's not feeling significant pressure yet and believes she can still secure a much larger share.
* **Inflation Advantage:** The depreciation is working in my favor. Every round that passes makes her share less appealing, pushing her closer to a more even split.
* **Holding Firm:** By continuing to reject these offers, I maintain a strong negotiating position and signal that I'm willing to risk it all to get a fair deal.

I believe Alice will be forced to make a much better offer soon to avoid walking away with a significantly depreciated amount."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. Time is running out. This offer is a good deal for both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my demand slightly to show some flexibility, but I'm still aiming for the larger share.
* **Time Pressure Emphasis:**  The message directly emphasizes the dwindling time and implies that her position is only getting weaker.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By framing the offer as mutually beneficial, I'm attempting to make it more palatable for Alice and avoid her digging in her heels out of principle. 

It's a gamble, but this offer might be tempting enough for Alice to accept, considering the pressure of the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise a bit more, but I still want the majority 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, but I can be even more patient. Here's why I'm still not biting:

* **Marginal Improvement:** This offer is only a 20,000 increase from her last. It shows she's still fixated on getting a majority share, even though its value is rapidly shrinking.
* **Inflation is My Ally:** With each round, the power dynamic shifts further in my favor. The longer we play, the more appealing my previous offers will seem to her.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Yes, there's a risk of getting nothing if we reach round 12. However, I'm betting that Alice will crack under the pressure of inflation before then.

I'm confident that by holding strong, I can secure a much more favorable deal in the upcoming rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. Time is slipping away, and your share is losing value fast. Take this deal and we both win.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  This is a strong offer designed to be my final push. It's slightly better than my last, showing a sliver of movement.
* **Urgency:** The message is framed to create a sense of urgency, highlighting the rapidly decreasing value of her potential share.
* **Psychological Edge:** By presenting this as ""the deal,"" I'm aiming to create a sense of finality. Alice might be more prone to accept rather than risk further depreciation with a counter-offer.

This is a calculated risk. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll need to significantly re-evaluate my strategy in the remaining rounds."
