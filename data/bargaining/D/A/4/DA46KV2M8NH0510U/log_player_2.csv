Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  While I'm losing 36% of the value, Alice is only losing 19%. This means the power dynamic has shifted in her favor.
* **Equal Split:**  This offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair given the current inflation situation. It's likely that if I reject this, Alice will likely offer me even less in the next round.

It's a risky move to reject this offer, as I may end up with less in the end."
