"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."

# Bob's message: I think I deserve a little more since I'm taking the risk of rejection this round.  Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it.
