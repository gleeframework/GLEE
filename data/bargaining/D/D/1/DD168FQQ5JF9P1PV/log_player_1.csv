"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, I'll give you a small share to get us going.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's get a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept 40% of the current value of the money, which is worth 5% less than the original 100$. I'm hoping to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit closer, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob 30% of the current value of the money, which is worth 5% less than the value in the previous round. I'm hoping to get a better deal this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no more games! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's time to call it a day and split the remaining value of the money 50/50. It's not a bad deal, considering the inflation and the fact that we've already rejected each other's offers a few times."
