Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money is worth less due to inflation. My gain of 50$ is worth 95% of the original value, and Bob's gain of 50$ is worth 90% of the original value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
