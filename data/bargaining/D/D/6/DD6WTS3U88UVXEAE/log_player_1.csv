"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I want to maximize my share in the first round. Since the value of the money decreases for me with each round, I'll offer Bob a minimal amount ($1) to secure the deal and avoid the risk of getting a worse offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though my share is significantly reduced due to inflation, accepting Bob's offer guarantees me half of the remaining value. If I reject, there's a risk of getting a worse deal in the next round as inflation continues to erode the value of the money for me."
