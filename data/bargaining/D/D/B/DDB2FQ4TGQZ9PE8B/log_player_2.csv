"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  Take this deal and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at your share. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nReason: Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal before accepting. Losing 5% of the value in one round is significant, but I believe I can negotiate for a larger share than 10%. If I accept this offer, I'll be losing out on potential gains, so I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n###\nYour turn! Please proceed with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 250000, ""alice_gain"": 750000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk to get a fairer share. This is my counteroffer.""}\n###\nReason: Since I'm losing 5% of the value each round, I want to negotiate for a larger share than the initial 10% offered. I believe 25% is a more reasonable amount, considering the decreasing value of the money for me. I'm hoping Alice will consider this counteroffer and we can come to an agreement.\n###\nYour turn! Please proceed with the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, Bob, but this is my final offer. Let's settle before inflation hurts you further. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\nReason: Although the money is now worth 9.75% less for me, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Alice's offer of 15% is an improvement from the initial 10%, but considering the decreasing value of the money for me, I'm not willing to settle for this amount yet. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a larger share.\n###\nYour turn! Please proceed with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 300000, ""alice_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get a fairer share. This is my counteroffer. Let's settle before inflation hurts me further.""}\n###\nReason: Since the money is now worth 9.75% less for me, I want to negotiate for an even larger share to compensate for the loss in value. I believe 30% is a reasonable amount, considering the decreasing value of the money for me. I'm hoping Alice will consider this counteroffer and we can come to an agreement before the inflation further reduces the value of my potential gain.\n###\nYour turn! Please proceed with the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this back and forth is only hurting you.  Accept this offer before inflation makes it even worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 175000 
# Alice gain: 825000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n###\nReason: Considering the money is now worth 18.55% less for me, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. The previous rounds of negotiation have increased my share from the initial 10% to 17.5%, which is a significant improvement. Although I had hoped for an even larger share, the decreasing value of the money for me due to inflation means that further negotiation may not be beneficial. I'll accept this offer to avoid losing even more value to inflation.\n###\nYour turn! Please conclude the game."
