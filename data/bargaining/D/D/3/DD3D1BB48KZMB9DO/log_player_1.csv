"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. This seems fair since I'm taking a larger share, but I'm also leaving something for him. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much better than my previous offer, but I'm not sure I want to settle for this yet. I'm going to try to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to propose a split of $7,000 for me and $3,000 for Bob.  I'm trying to be fair while still getting a good deal, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It seems like Bob is getting more and more assertive with his proposals. Given the inflation, my share is worth significantly less than it was in the beginning.  While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise at this point.  I'm going to accept."
