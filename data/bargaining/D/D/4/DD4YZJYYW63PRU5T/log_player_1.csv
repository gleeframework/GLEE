"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice.  It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money I gain, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, $5,000 is equivalent to $5,000 / 0.9 = $5,556.67 in the first round.

Considering the offer, I think it's a good deal for me. I get more than half of the total amount, and it's a fair split. I accept the offer.
