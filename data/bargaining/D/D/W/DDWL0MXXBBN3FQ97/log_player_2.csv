"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we'll see how things play out. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept, especially with the inflation factor in play, rejecting the offer sets up a better negotiating position for Bob in the long run.  It's a risk, but it allows Bob to potentially get a better deal as the rounds progress and the money becomes less valuable for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
