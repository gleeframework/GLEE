# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll lower my demand slightly, but I'm still aiming for a bigger share.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a good deal for both of us."

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to continue to reject his offers and see if I can convince him to come to a more reasonable agreement."

I'm still holding out for a decent share, but I'm willing to compromise a little more. Hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the inflation eats away at our potential earnings even further."

Bob's offer is finally getting closer to being fair.  With the inflation hitting him harder than me, I think this is the best I can do. Let's end this game!"
