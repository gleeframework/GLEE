Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a point where inflation will significantly impact our potential gains. Let's settle this fairly with a 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's getting too risky to continue rejecting offers. While not ideal, a 50/50 split is better than nothing, which is what we'll get if we keep going at this rate."
