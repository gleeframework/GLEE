Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, but with the growing inflation difference, I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and yours

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is working heavily against Bob. While getting a slightly better deal in future rounds is tempting, the rapid devaluation of his potential gains makes it risky. Accepting Alice's current offer, while not ideal, secures a reasonable sum before inflation erodes it further."
