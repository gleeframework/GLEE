"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose a very uneven split, giving Bob $1 and keeping $999,999 for myself.  I'm hoping he'll accept this, as he's unlikely to do better in the next round, especially if inflation is a factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not ideal to get only $100,000, it's better than risking getting nothing if I reject and Bob proposes something even worse in the next round.  The inflation factor means the value of his offer could decrease even further."
