I'm going for a large share, but I'm also leaving Bob a decent amount to make him more likely to accept. Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept that! Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm willing to wait and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit, but I'm still offering Bob a substantial amount. The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to make sure we reach an agreement soon."
