Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic ultimatum game.  I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it rather than risk getting nothing at all in a later round. Since I'm taking a much larger share, I'm hoping to maximize my potential gain before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the risk of getting nothing at all after 12 rounds is too great. This offer gives me a significant amount of money, and the decreasing value due to inflation makes it a better deal than waiting for another round."
