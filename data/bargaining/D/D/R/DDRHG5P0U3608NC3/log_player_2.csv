"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 42.5 
# Alice gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Alice.
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice is clearly willing to compromise. Her offer is moving closer to a more even split.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that if I reject this, Alice will offer me a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might become more desperate and offer even less.

Taking the offer now guarantees me a reasonable amount, even if it's not a perfect 50/50 split."
