Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try to secure the majority of the money in the first round, leaving a small amount for Bob. This strategy aims to minimize potential losses from inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though my offer from Round 1 was rejected, the inflation is a significant factor. Taking a 6000$ gain now is better than risking it all and ending up with nothing."
