4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think it's fair that I take a bit more. Let's settle on 55% for me and 45% for you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting us both. I'll take a slight hit from my previous offer, offering you $4,900.  Let's close this deal before it gets any worse.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Inflation is indeed taking its toll, but I believe my share should be higher considering the decreasing value. I'm willing to take 58% now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking another significant hit due to inflation.  Let's end this now before we both lose even more. $5,200 for you, and let's move on.",Alice,5,
