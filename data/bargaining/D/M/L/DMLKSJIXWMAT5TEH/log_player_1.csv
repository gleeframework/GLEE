"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. I've included a message, ""Let's be fair,"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept my offer.\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable, this offer prevents further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 10% less to me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a more favorable offer.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! What will Bob do next?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Split the difference""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4750 and keep $5250 for myself. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now (10% less in each of the first two rounds), I need to adjust my offer accordingly. My message, ""Split the difference,"" suggests that we're meeting in the middle, which might be more acceptable to Bob.\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
