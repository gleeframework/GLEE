"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a relatively fair offer, considering we're trying to divide the money between us. I'm taking a bit more, $550,000, as I'm the one making the first offer. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time, I think it's fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I'd be getting $400,000 that's worth 10% less than in the first round, and Bob would be getting $600,000 that's worth 20% less. I think I can make a better offer in the next round to compensate for the loss in value. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, we're both losing value""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering an even split of $500,000 each. Given the inflation, we're both losing value, and I think an even split is a fair way to go. The message conveys a sense of mutual loss and a desire to find a middle ground. Hopefully, Bob will see it that way too!"
