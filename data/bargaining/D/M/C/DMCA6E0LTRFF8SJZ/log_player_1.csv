"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further if needed""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Let me know what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was initially.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risks of inflation""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
