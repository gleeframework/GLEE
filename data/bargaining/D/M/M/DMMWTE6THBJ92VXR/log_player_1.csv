"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to be greedy and see if Bob is willing to accept a tiny amount.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is clearly being just as greedy as I am.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if he'll be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob by $9. Hopefully, he'll see this as a sign of good faith and we can start getting closer to a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 999990 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still ridiculously unfair.  He's not even budging! I'm going to reject this and hope that by the next round, he realizes that we both need to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. It's the fairest solution, and with only 7 rounds left, we need to start making progress.  Hopefully, Bob will finally see reason and accept."
