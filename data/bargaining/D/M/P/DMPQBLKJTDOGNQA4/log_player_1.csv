"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 4:1 ratio""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, which is a generous offer considering I'm starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split, 3:2 ratio 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. So, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think 60 for me is a bit too low. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, I'll aim to get a bit more this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 60:40""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth only 51.2% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's proposal, a 50/50 split seems reasonable, and it's a fair offer considering the current state of the game. I'll accept this offer.
