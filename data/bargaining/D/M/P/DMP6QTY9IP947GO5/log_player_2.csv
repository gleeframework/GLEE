"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I know that inflation is a factor, and I want to try and get a better deal for myself. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair reflection of the value of my time and effort in this negotiation.  Let's end this quickly and avoid further inflation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair to split the money equally, considering the risk of inflation and the uncertainty of future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept this offer.  Even though it's not as good as what I initially wanted, the risk of further inflation is too high.  A 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
