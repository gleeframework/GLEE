"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share right away, or if he's going to play it safe and try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, it's better to accept a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
