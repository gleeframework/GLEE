"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $550,000 while Bob gets $450,000. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, hoping he'll accept this slightly unequal division without feeling too disadvantaged, thus ending the game early and avoiding further loss of value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation that has already reduced the value of the money by 10% from the first round, accepting 50% now is less valuable than what I could potentially gain by pushing for a better offer in subsequent rounds, despite the risk of further inflation.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Consider the next inflation""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm increasing my proposed share slightly, to $580,000, while Bob gets $420,000. The message ""Consider the next inflation"" is a reminder to Bob that further delay will reduce the value of the money even more, hoping this will motivate him to accept my offer rather than risk losing more value in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more to avoid further inflation.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, even though Bob is trying to appear generous by giving me ""a bit more,"" the offer of $450,000 for me is actually less valuable due to the inflation that has already occurred. Since we're only in Round 4 out of 12, I believe there's still room to negotiate for a better share, despite the risk of further inflation decreasing the money's value. Accepting this offer would mean I'm settling for less than what I've previously proposed, and I'm not ready to do that yet.###"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Inflation hurts us both, let's end this""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm increasing my proposed share to $600,000, while Bob gets $400,000. The message ""Inflation hurts us both, let's end this"" acknowledges that both of us are losing value with each passing round and aims to persuade Bob that accepting this offer is better than risking further devaluation. By emphasizing the mutual loss, I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in concluding the negotiations now rather than later.###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share to close this out.  Let's cut our losses. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, even though Bob frames his proposal as taking a bigger share to ""close this out,"" the offer of $420,000 for me is still less than what I've been aiming for. Given that we're halfway through the rounds and the money's value is decreasing significantly, I'm aware that I need to balance the desire for a better share with the risk of further inflation. However, accepting this offer would mean I'm agreeing to a share that's lower than my previous proposals, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to try and secure a better deal.###"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 620000, ""bob_gain"": 380000, ""message"": ""We're running out of time""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm slightly increasing my proposed share to $620,000, while Bob gets $380,000. The message ""We're running out of time"" is a reminder to Bob that we're more than halfway through the negotiation rounds and that further delay will significantly reduce the value of any amount we might agree upon. By emphasizing the urgency of the situation, I'm hoping to persuade Bob that accepting this offer is preferable to the risk of ending up with even less due to inflation.###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a bigger share, but this is my final offer before we risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept this offer because, at this point, the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. We're in Round 8 out of 12, and the risk of continuing negotiations and possibly ending up with nothing or a significantly reduced amount is too high. Bob's offer of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for himself is not ideal from my perspective, but given the circumstances and the fact that Bob has framed this as his ""final offer,"" I believe accepting this is the most pragmatic decision to ensure I receive some value rather than risking it all. Continuing to reject offers at this stage could lead to both of us walking away with nothing, which would be the worst outcome.###"
