"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 70/30 split in favor of Alice seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the potential impact of inflation. Since Bob's money loses 10% of its value each round, accepting this offer would result in Bob getting less than $3,000 in real value. It's worth seeing if Alice will offer a more favorable split in the next round, as Bob has the opportunity to propose in the subsequent round."
