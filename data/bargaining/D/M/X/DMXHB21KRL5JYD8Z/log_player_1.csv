Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your rate is higher, so let's adjust slightly to be more fair to both of us in the long run. This offer is better for you than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is slightly better for me in the short term, but still heavily favors him in the long run.  I need to signal I'm willing to play a few rounds to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out for both of us.  This offer is a good compromise to close the deal before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is barely budging while  inflation is eating into the total value. It's risky, but I need to push him further to get a better deal before we run out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and the different inflation rates. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to a point where the deal won't be worth it for either of us. I'm sticking to my previous offer - it's a fair split considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but with only six rounds remaining and Bob refusing to budge, the risk of walking away with nothing is too high.  It's not ideal, but it's better than losing everything to inflation."
