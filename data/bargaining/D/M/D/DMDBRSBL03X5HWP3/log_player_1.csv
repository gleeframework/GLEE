"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. This leaves me with $80. I'm framing this as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $70 is actually worth 5% less than the $80 I would have gotten in the previous round, so it's equivalent to $76.20 in the original terms.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
