"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll think carefully... With the inflation rates, the actual amounts I'd gain and lose are:

* My gain: 100,000 x 0.8 = 80,000 (due to 20% less)
* Bob's gain: 900,000 x 0.95 = 855,000 (due to 5% less)

I'm not sure if I want to give up so much to Bob. I'll reject his offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time for me to make a new proposal!

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm trying to balance the stakes, but I'm still keeping a slight edge. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 300,000 x 0.516 (80% of 0.8) = 154,800 (due to 48.8% less)
* Bob's gain: 700,000 x 0.857 (95% of 0.95) = 600,490 (due to 14.26% less)

I'm not thrilled about giving up so much to Bob, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll think carefully...

I'll accept Bob's offer.
