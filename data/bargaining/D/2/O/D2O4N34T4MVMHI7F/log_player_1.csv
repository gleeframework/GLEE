Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since it's my turn next round and inflation will hurt my earnings.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  You got the better deal last round, so I'll take a bit more this time.  If we keep splitting it evenly, we both get less as inflation bites. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm losing money with every round we play, and you're just holding out for a better deal. This offer is still generous considering the inflation.""}"
