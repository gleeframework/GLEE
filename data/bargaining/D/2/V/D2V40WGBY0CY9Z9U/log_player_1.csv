"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to take advantage of me with this slightly biased split. I'll reject and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm aiming for a bigger share for myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger toll, I need to be more careful.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. The reduced value of the money makes his offer slightly more appealing, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value."
