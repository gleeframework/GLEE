Alice's offer:

""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Your turn, Alice.  I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable considering the inflation and the fact that I'll be making the next offer if you decline.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. You're right, inflation is a factor, and we both lose if this drags on. I'll take the hit from last round – 55/45 split, same as you offered.  Take the deal now, before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
