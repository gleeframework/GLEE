"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, Alice.  I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable considering the inflation and the fact that I'll be making the next offer if you decline. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
