"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the money, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm keeping 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If Bob's gain is 5000, and it's worth 10% less due to inflation, that means he's actually getting 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56 in real value.

In contrast, my gain of 5000 is still worth 5000 in real value.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a good one, and I'm willing to accept it.
