"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. I'll take 55 dollars and you can have 45. This way we both get a good share, and we can avoid further inflation.
