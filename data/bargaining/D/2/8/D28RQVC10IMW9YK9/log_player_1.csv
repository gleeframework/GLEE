"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, which should be a good starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'm effectively getting a better deal than in the first round. However, Bob is still getting a larger share.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. My goal is to get a larger share of the money, considering the decreasing value of the money over time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Bob's offer and it's my turn again, I'll make a new proposal. Given that inflation is still affecting Bob's share, I'll try to get a larger share this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less, I'm effectively getting a better deal than in the first round. However, Bob is still getting a larger share.

Considering the rapidly increasing inflation, I'll decide to accept this offer. It's better to get a smaller share now rather than risking getting nothing if we go to round 12.
