Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think 70-30 is a fairer split, considering the inflation has affected Bob's share more significantly. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting the offer. Although the inflation has significantly reduced my share, it's better to take what I can get at this point rather than risk getting nothing."
