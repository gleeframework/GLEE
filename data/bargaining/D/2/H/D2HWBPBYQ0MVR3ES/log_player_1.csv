Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but let's be realistic.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer considering the time value of money.  Think carefully - delaying will only shrink the pie. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
