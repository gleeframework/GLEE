"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob 100,000 and keep 900,000 for myself.  I'm hoping he'll accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the next round. With the 20% inflation, my share of the money will be significantly reduced if I reject and then Bob proposes a new offer."
