"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fairness, Alice, but I think a more even split is possible. Let's try 60/40 this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the numbers are:

* My gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as my initial offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the remaining rounds, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle and then I'll take a bit more.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm taking 55% of the current value of the money, which is $55, and Bob will get 45%, which is $45."
