"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but still leaves something for Bob. This might incentivize Bob to accept, especially considering the inflation factor that will impact him more heavily in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

Since Bob rejected my offer, and I know that he's more heavily impacted by inflation, I'm willing to offer him a slightly larger share in this round. This might incentivize him to accept, especially since the inflation rate will further reduce his gains in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is still heavily in Bob's favor, the inflation rates are working against him significantly.  My gains are also significantly reduced from the first round. Accepting this offer is the best option to avoid losing even more money in the next round."
