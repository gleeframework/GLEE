"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate further if you want to, but remember inflation hits us both eventually! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 1000$ is something, it's a very small share. There's a chance to get a better deal, and even if the offer is worse later, the inflation effect is minimal in the first round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split this more evenly. I propose we each take half, with me getting a slight edge to account for the inflation. We can work out the details later, but I believe this is a fair starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still feeling the effects of inflation.  Let's split 60/40, with me taking the larger share to compensate.  I'm open to further discussion, but I don't want to lose too much more value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, this is a significant improvement from the first round. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent share, and further negotiation might not result in a much better deal. The risk of further rounds and potential losses due to inflation outweighs the desire for a slightly larger share."
