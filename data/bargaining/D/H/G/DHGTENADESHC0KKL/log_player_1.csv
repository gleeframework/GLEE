"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair division considering we're starting with a large amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more balanced split, 50-50! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the 5% reduction in value, but I think Bob's 50-50 proposal is a good compromise.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
