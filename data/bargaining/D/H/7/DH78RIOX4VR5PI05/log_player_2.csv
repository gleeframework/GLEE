"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'm happy to take a slightly smaller share to get things started. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer, Alice is giving me a smaller share than what I'm expecting, and I think I can get a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less this time to start things off, but let's see if we can find a fairer deal for both of us in the future.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can both do a little better than that. Let's compromise and see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  Although it's not ideal, I've lost a significant amount of money due to inflation. Getting something is better than nothing at this point."
