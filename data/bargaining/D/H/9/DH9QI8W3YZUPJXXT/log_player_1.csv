Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a good starting point, and I'm confident that with each round, the value of the money will decrease more for Bob than for me, making this offer more attractive to him as the game goes on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is much more favorable than my previous one, I'm still not satisfied. It's clear we're both trying to leverage the inflation factor in our favor. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm proposing an 80/20 split in my favor.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm increasing my share slightly. However, I'm keeping it relatively reasonable to encourage him to accept. The inflation factor is still working in my favor, so I'm optimistic he'll see the value in taking this deal rather than waiting for the next round."
