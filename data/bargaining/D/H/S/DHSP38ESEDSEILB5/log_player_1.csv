# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's still heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I think I can do better. I'd like to make another proposal to try to get a better deal.

Let's see... I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the erosion of my share due to inflation.
