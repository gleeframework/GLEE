Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try and secure most of the money, as I have the advantage of knowing about the inflation. I figure I can offer Bob a small amount to ensure he accepts in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even though the inflation hurts me, Bob's offer is significantly better than what I'd get if I reject and continue to the next round. My offer is worth 20% less, and it's unlikely Bob would give me such a large share again."
