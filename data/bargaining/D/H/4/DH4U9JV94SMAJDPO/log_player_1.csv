Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's my turn to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the current value of the money. With the 10% decrease in value for Bob, the offer is:

* Alice gain: $300,000 (worth $300,000)
* Bob gain: $700,000 (worth $630,000)

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.
