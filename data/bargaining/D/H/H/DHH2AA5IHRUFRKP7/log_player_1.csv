"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. My message is a friendly invitation to consider the proposal and respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair shot, Alice. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice's gain: 500,000 x 0.95 = 475,000
Bob's gain: 500,000 x 0.95 = 475,000

Considering the offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer and we can split the money 50/50."
