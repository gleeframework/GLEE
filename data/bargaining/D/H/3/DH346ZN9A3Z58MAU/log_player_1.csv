"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $100, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm being generous, but I'm also hoping to set the tone for the game. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 70 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $76. And Bob's gain of 30 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $16.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
