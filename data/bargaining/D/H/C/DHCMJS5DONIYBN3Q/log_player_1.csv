Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering you a generous 300,000$, take it or leave it before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
