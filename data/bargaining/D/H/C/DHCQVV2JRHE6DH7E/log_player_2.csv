"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I'm feeling the inflation pinch already! Let's make a deal that's a bit better for me this time.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is already worth 20% less for me than it was in Round 1. It's crucial to secure a larger share now.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While Alice's offer was tempting, my offer is still reasonably fair. It gives her a slight edge over what she'd get if she waits another round (where my offer will likely be less generous)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than last time. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Pressure:**  The money is losing value rapidly for me. Another round means a further 20% decrease in value.
* **Offer Improvement:**  While not ideal, Alice's offer has improved. Accepting now secures a better outcome than risking another round where her offer might be even lower. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly larger share isn't worth the potential loss from inflation."
