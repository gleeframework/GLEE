"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, given that I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than getting nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. It's my turn next, and I'll try to get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to try and split the difference from the last round.  A 60/40 split seems like a fairer compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a better deal than the last offer, and with inflation happening, I'd rather get a good amount of money than risk getting nothing at all. I'll accept Bob's offer."
