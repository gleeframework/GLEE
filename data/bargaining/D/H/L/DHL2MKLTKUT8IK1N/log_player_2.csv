Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. My patience is wearing thin. This is my final 'generous' offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice, even though it's not an ideal outcome. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  Bob is losing a significant chunk of value with each round. Accepting $440,000 now is better than risking an even lower offer later.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice's messages indicate she's becoming less willing to negotiate. Waiting might lead to even worse offers.
* **Limited Rounds:** While we don't know how many rounds there are, waiting indefinitely is too risky with the current inflation rate. 

Bob needs to cut his losses and accept a less than favorable deal before inflation eats away even more of his potential gains."
