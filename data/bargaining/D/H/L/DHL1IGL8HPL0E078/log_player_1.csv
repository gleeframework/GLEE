"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and revisit in the next round 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, but I still think a 50-50 split is a reasonable compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
