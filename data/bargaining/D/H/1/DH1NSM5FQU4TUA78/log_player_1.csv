"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, my gain of $6,000 is still $6,000.

However, Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 10% less than his original share of $4,000, which means he's actually offering me a better deal this time around.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
