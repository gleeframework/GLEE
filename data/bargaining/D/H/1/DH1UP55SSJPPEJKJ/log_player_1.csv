Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small amount and keep the vast majority for myself.  Since he's the one with the advantage in this game (no inflation on his side), I'm hoping he'll accept this small offer rather than risk getting nothing at all in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's not ideal, but with inflation eating into my gains, it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting even less in the future."
