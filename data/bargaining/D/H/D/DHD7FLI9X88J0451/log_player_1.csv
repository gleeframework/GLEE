"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I get a decent amount to start with, and Bob gets a smaller share, but still a significant one. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Bob's offer is quite generous, I'll accept it for now.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
