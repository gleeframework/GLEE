Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. We both get a fair share, and we avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was fair, but doesn't quite make up for the inflation you're protected from. I'm still open to a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
