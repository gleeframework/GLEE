"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a generous offer considering the inflation rate for him is 20% per round. This way, we can both benefit from the deal, and Bob has an incentive to accept the offer before the money loses more value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation will affect me more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because it gives Bob a larger share, and considering the inflation rate, it's not in my best interest. The money is worth the same for me in every round, so I have no incentive to accept a worse deal than what I initially proposed. I'll wait for the next round to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, but still keeping in mind that the money loses value for him with each passing round. I aim to find a balance where Bob feels inclined to accept before the value drops further, while also maximizing my gain.\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering your loss, this is a fairer deal""}\n\nI've decreased my share by 20,000 dollars from the initial offer, giving Bob a bit more in an attempt to account for the loss in value he's experiencing due to inflation. This gesture shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a favorable position."
