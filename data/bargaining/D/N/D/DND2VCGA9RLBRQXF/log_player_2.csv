"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is compromising slightly, the deal is still worse than her initial offer after accounting for inflation. My bargaining position is getting weaker with each round. I need to push for a more significant concession in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time is running out! Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't go to 50/50 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is barely budging, and time is running out. While this offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still a bad deal for me considering the inflation. I need to signal I'm serious about not accepting a bad deal, even if it means risking getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm taking a hit from the inflation, but we both need to agree to something before we get nothing!""}"
