Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite cheeky!  Let's be reasonable. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This factors in the inflation and gives you something before it shrinks further. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
