Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a fair deal. I propose a 60/40 split, with me taking $60. This way we both benefit from ending the game quickly.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite cheeky!  Let's be reasonable. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This factors in the inflation and gives you something before it shrinks further.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer was too low for me. Let's be practical - I propose a 55/45 split. This accounts for the decreasing value and is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
