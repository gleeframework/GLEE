I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor, as I believe it's a fair starting point considering the potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'm offering a 8000/2000 split, acknowledging the inflation but still aiming for a significant share."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm adjusting my offer again due to the increasing inflation, but I still believe a larger share is necessary."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. Even though the inflation is significant, I believe I can secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 6000/4000 split. This is a significant compromise considering the escalating inflation, but I still need to ensure a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer. The inflation has eroded my share considerably, but I believe I can still secure a better deal with a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only a few rounds remaining, and the inflation reaching a critical point, I believe a 50/50 split is the most fair and realistic solution.  We both get a decent share, and we avoid the risk of losing everything if we keep rejecting offers."
