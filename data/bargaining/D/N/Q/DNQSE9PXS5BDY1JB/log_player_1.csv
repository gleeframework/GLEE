Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I believe I can get a better deal than $450,000. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI have offered Bob $450,000 and I will take $550,000.
