"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000

This is a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get closer to the 60/40 split again! I'll reject this offer as well. Here's my reasoning: if I accept this offer, I'll be giving up too much, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.
