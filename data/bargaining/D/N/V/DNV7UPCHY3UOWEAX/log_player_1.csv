Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too one-sided for my liking. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
