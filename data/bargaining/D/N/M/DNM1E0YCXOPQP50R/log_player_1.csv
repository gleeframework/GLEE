I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, aiming for a quick resolution. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  Hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept before the inflation gets worse."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more unreasonable!  I'm still confident I can get a better deal, especially with the inflation impacting Bob more heavily than me.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a significant share.  The inflation is starting to really hurt Bob, so I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this offer before it gets even worse."

# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not fair.  He's trying to take advantage of the inflation, and I'm not going to let him get away with it.  I'll keep rejecting his offers until he gives me a deal that's more equitable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

The inflation is really starting to bite now, but I'm still holding out for a better deal than Bob is offering.  I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but I'm hoping he'll realize that it's in his best interest to accept before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really hitting hard now, and it's clear that we're running out of time.  I'm still not happy with the offer, but it's better than ending up with nothing.  I'll accept this offer and take what I can get."
