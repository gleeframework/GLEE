"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive rounds. I propose a 60/40 split. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share, is fairer. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was too greedy considering the inflation. I'm being more reasonable, let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, accepting this offer secures a decent amount of money for me and avoids further rounds where Alice's gain gets even smaller due to inflation."
