"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept this in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While Bob is offering me more than he did in the first round, the inflation has made the money worth less, and I'm still not satisfied with only $2,000. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,500, which is slightly less than his previous offer, but I'm hoping the fear of further inflation will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering me a larger share than in the last round, the inflation has significantly diminished the value of the money. I still believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself. I'm going to take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is slightly more than his previous offer.  I believe that the increasing rate of inflation is making the money worth less, and Bob may be more willing to settle for a smaller share to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation has severely diminished the value of the money.  At this point, accepting an equal split is the best option to avoid further losses."
