"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, I'll give you a generous share. Accept and we can end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $270,000.

I'm not too happy with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is significantly lower than Bob's, I'll think carefully before deciding.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I want to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so $1,000,000 is now worth $900,000.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too greedy, I'll meet you halfway this time! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $600,000 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is $437,400.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation, I might as well try to accept this offer.

However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get, and I don't want to give up too much. I'll think carefully before deciding.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
