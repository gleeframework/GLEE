"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the money, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me in the second round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially since I'll be getting a smaller share due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more. Consider this a fair middle ground.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob a significant portion of the money. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, it's still a better option than going into the next round with even less purchasing power.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 2000$ and hope that it's enough to get me through the next few rounds."
