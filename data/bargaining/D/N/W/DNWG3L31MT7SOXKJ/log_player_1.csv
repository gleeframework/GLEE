"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can do better in later rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% and Bob gets 40% of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a more even split. Let's try this, and see if we can work together in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept an even split just yet. I think I can do better than 40%."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so I'll aim to get a bigger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You were close, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. Let's see if you can do better next time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55% share for myself and 45% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair offer, let's make a deal and end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final offer. I'll consider it carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split just yet. I think I can get a better deal than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. I'll aim to get an even bigger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""You were close last time, but I'm willing to give you a bit less this time. Let's see if you can do better next time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 65% share for myself and 35% for Bob."
