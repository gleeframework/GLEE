"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid further rounds and the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to be a bit more cautious. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about the offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the effects of inflation in mind, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly smaller share to Bob, but still a significant amount, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to be careful. The money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the effects of inflation mounting, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm now offering a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game before the money loses too much value."
