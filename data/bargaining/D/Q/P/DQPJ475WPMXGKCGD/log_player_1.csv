"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too hard.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This way, we can both be satisfied and avoid unnecessary negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I'm worth more than you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob thinks he's worth more than me, huh?

I'll have to consider the inflation factor, though. My gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, since it's 20% less due to inflation.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm worth less than Bob, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer.

Since my gain is worth 80% of the original amount, I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the loss. I'll propose a 55/45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You think you're worth more, but I'm not convinced. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced you're getting a fair share. You're going to have to do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still not satisfied with the split.

My gain of $300,000 is now worth 48.8% of the original amount, due to the cumulative inflation.

I'm starting to feel the pinch, but I'll think carefully before making a decision...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with such a small share, especially considering the inflation. I'll make another proposal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

In this round, my gain of $300,000 is worth 48.8% of the original amount, which is approximately $148,400 in real terms.

Considering this, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of my gain. I'll propose a 60/40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to make up for the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not getting enough. I'm not budging on this one. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings now!

My gain of $200,000 is now worth 20% of the original amount, which is approximately $20,000 in real terms.

I'm starting to feel the pinch, but I'll think carefully before making a decision...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with such a tiny share, especially considering the massive inflation. I'll make another proposal in the next round, but it's getting increasingly difficult to make ends meet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. My gain of $200,000 is now worth 20% of the original amount, which is approximately $20,000 in real terms.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the extreme inflation. I'll propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm desperate, Bob. I need a better deal to survive the inflation.""
}
```

It's a risk, but I'm hoping Bob will take pity on me and accept this extreme proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really scraping the bottom of the barrel now. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has ravaged my potential earnings to the point where my gain of $100,000 is now worth approximately $2,000 in real terms.

I'm left with no choice but to accept Bob's offer, as it's the best I can get at this point. I'll have to live with the consequences of the inflation and accept the tiny share.
