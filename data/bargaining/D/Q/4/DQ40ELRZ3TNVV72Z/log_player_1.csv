"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we can end the game quickly if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice's gain: $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000
Bob's gain: $500,000

I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
