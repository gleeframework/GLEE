"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll give you 40% of the money.  We can both come out ahead if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I notice that Bob is offering the same deal as I did in the first round, but with the same amounts, which means he's gaining more than I am. I'll reject this offer since I'd rather negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll offer a smaller amount to myself to account for the reduced value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a slight edge. Let's compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800 and keeping $4,200 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little less this time, but I think this is a good deal for both of us.  Let's end this game and split the money. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and Bob is offering me $3,000, which is a relatively small amount. I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 14.26% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer. Given the reduced value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
