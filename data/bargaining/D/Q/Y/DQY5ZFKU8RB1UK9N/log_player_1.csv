Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is a bit better than his potential gain in the next round if I reject (considering the 5% inflation for him), but it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal by making a counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""message"": ""This offer is more balanced considering the inflation, Bob. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Bob's Position Weakening:**  Bob's potential gains decrease faster with each round (5% inflation for him versus my 10%). This gives me a bit more leverage. 
* **Appearance of Compromise:** While this offer is still in my favor, it's closer to the middle ground than my previous offer. This might make Bob more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, this is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the inflation eats significantly into the potential gains.  It's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While Bob's offer isn't ideal, waiting another round means I'll likely be pushing for a difference of a few thousand dollars (after accounting for inflation), which isn't worth the risk.
* **Bird in Hand:**  It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk ending up with a worse deal (or nothing) if I continue to reject offers."
