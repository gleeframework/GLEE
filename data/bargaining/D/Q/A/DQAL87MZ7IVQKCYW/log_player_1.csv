"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to the initial offer, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $8,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's now worth $7,600. And Bob's gain of $2,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's now worth $1,800.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a more even split than my initial proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
