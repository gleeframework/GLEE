"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going to propose a very uneven split in my favor for the first round.  This is a gamble, as Bob might reject it, but I want to see if I can establish a strong initial position and leverage the inflation to my advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious factor now.  Accepting a 50/50 split is a good outcome given the circumstances."
