"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: In the first round, Alice proposes a division where she gets 60% of the money and I get 40%. Considering that the money's value decreases with each round, and it decreases more for me than for Alice, I should try to negotiate for a better deal. The difference in the decrease rate (10% for me vs. 5% for Alice) suggests that I should aim for a more favorable split early on to compensate for the greater loss in value I'll incur in subsequent rounds if we don't reach an agreement. Therefore, I reject this offer to see if I can get a better proposal in the next round or to propose a more favorable division myself."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""} 

Reasoning: Given the asymmetrical impact of inflation on our gains, where my share loses value faster than Alice's, I need to push for a higher share early on to offset the potential loss in future rounds. Offering a 55-45 split seems like a reasonable next step, as it still gives Alice a substantial portion while recognizing the different rates at which our shares lose value. This approach aims to strike a balance between being fair and compensating for the unequal effects of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair compromise after your offer.  Let's split it closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: In Round 3, Alice offers a 45-55 split, which is closer to the middle but still doesn't fully account for the disparate impact of inflation on our shares. Given that my potential gain is now worth 19% less than in the first round, while Alice's is only worth 9.75% less, accepting this offer would mean I'm not adequately compensating for the loss in value due to inflation. I should continue to negotiate for a better deal that reflects the asymmetrical effects of inflation on our shares. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose another division that could potentially offer me a more favorable outcome."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, I believe this adjustment is necessary to reach a fair agreement.""}\n\nReasoning: As we progress through the rounds, the effect of inflation becomes more pronounced, with my potential gains decreasing in value more rapidly than Alice's. In Round 4, it's crucial to adjust my proposal to account for this disparity. By offering a 58-42 split, I'm attempting to find a balance that acknowledges the unequal impact of inflation on our shares. This approach aims to be fair while also recognizing the need to compensate for the greater loss in value I'm experiencing with each passing round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer to the end. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nReasoning: In Round 5, Alice offers a 50-50 split, which is a significant concession considering the previous offers. Given the substantial impact of inflation on my potential gains (now worth 34.39% less than in the first round), and the fact that we are getting closer to the end of the game with the risk of both getting nothing if we don't agree, accepting this offer seems like the most rational decision. While I've been pushing for a better deal to compensate for the unequal effects of inflation, a 50-50 split at this point represents a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a substantial amount, albeit reduced by inflation. Continuing to negotiate risks further losses, making this offer the best outcome under the current circumstances."
