"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering the game is just starting and the money is still worth its full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll reject his offer. My gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and I think I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the first round, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```"
