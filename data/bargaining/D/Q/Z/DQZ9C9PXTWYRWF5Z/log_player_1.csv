"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take the lion's share, leaving Bob with a small amount. This way, I ensure a large portion of the money in the first round, even with the inflation risk.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a larger share,  it's not in my best interest to keep rejecting offers.  I'm taking a significant loss with each passing round due to inflation.  Accepting this offer is the best way to maximize my potential gain at this point."
