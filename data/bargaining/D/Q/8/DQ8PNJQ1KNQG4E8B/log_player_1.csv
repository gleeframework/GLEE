"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 99/1 split in my favor. Since the money is worth less with each round, I want to maximize my share as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While a 30/70 split isn't ideal, I'm accepting this offer.  The inflation is hitting hard, and it's better to get something than risk getting nothing in the next round."
