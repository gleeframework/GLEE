"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, considering the decreasing value of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Even though Alice is offering a good deal, Bob can likely get a better deal in the next round since the value of the money is decreasing faster for Alice than it is for him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation rate is hitting you harder than me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe an equal split would be fair, given the current situation with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is fair in this round, as she is willing to accept a 50/50 split which is a good deal for both. The value of money is decreasing for both, and it's unlikely a better deal will be offered."
