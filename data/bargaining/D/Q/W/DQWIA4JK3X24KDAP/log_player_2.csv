Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this. You're playing a dangerous game with the time remaining. This offer is generous and it's the last one you'll get from me above your share. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is correct that time is running out, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm betting she'll be more desperate as we enter the later rounds and the impact of inflation on her share becomes even more significant."
