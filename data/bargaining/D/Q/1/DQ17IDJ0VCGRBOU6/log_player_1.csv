"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual values are:

* My gain: $60 * 0.95 = $57
* Bob's gain: $40 * 0.95 = $38

I'll accept this offer.
