"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can move on to the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, in the hopes that he will accept and we can proceed to the next round."
