I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 5% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the value of the money has decreased. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""}

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point."
