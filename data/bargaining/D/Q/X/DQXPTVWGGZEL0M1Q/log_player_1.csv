"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which is a 60-40 split. My message to Bob is that I'm starting with a fair split and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground, I'll meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $50 is worth 95% of the original $60, and Bob's gain of $50 is worth 80% of the original $40.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. I'll accept this offer.
