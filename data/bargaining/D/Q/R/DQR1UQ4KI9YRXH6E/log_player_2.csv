"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This might seem like a generous offer considering the decrease in value, but it's also fair given the risk of further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
