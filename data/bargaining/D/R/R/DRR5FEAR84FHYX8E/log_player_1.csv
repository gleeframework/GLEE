I'm going to start by offering Bob a very small amount, hoping he will accept it and the game will be over quickly.  I figure he might be willing to take anything, given how little he has to lose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation will make future rounds much worse for me. Taking 400,000 now is better than risking getting less later."
