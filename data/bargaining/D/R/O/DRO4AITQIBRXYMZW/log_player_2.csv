"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better with a more even split. This offer is fairer and gives us both a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most time-efficient solution.  The value decreases with each round, so accepting now benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the 50/50 split now before inflation eats away at any potential gains in future rounds."
