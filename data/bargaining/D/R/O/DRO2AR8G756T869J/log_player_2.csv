"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of you, Bob. This might give us a better chance to negotiate further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While 7500$ for Alice is a lot, I want to try and get more. It is too early in the game to accept a proposal that leaves me with only 25% of the money.  I will propose a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair deal and will help us both avoid the risk of losing everything due to inflation.""}
