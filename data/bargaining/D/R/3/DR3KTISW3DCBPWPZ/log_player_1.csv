"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still get the same amount as in the previous round, but Bob's offer is now worth 20% less than his original offer. Considering this, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I'm still aiming to get a significant portion of the initial $100, but I'm also leaving room for Bob to negotiate further."
