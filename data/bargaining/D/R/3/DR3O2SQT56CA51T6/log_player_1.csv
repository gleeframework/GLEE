I'm going to start by offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it in the early rounds.  I'll see if I can get a better deal as we go along.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more money, I don't want to risk losing everything. This offer is a fair split considering the inflation and I'm sure I can't get a better deal in the next rounds."
