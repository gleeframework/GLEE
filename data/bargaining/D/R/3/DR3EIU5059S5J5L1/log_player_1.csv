Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer, as I'm losing $100,000 compared to the initial offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although I'm still losing some value due to inflation, the offer is more generous than previous ones, and I'm getting a bigger share of the remaining money. I think it's a good compromise at this point."
