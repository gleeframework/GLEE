Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both lose value over time, so a fair split is the best way to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer for a 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface, I'm losing value at double his rate. Accepting this now means I'm agreeing to a progressively worse deal for myself. It's better to counter with an offer that still leans in my favor, taking into account the inflation disadvantage."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Your offer is tempting, Bob, but the uneven inflation rate means we need to adjust. This offer recognizes your fairness while accounting for the value we lose each round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise!  I'll take a slightly smaller share to help us both get something, but I need to be closer to 50% given the inflation disparity. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The game is now entering a critical phase.  Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're at round 4 of 12. The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth, especially to me.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, Bob's offer is now getting close enough to my previous offer to make holding out riskier.  The difference in gains shrinks considerably with each round due to inflation.
* **Bob's Concessions:** Bob has moved significantly from an even split. This indicates he's feeling the pressure of the limited rounds and is willing to compromise.

While I could try to push for a slightly better deal, there's a real chance Bob will dig in, and we'll both end up with nothing. This offer secures me a reasonable amount considering the circumstances."
