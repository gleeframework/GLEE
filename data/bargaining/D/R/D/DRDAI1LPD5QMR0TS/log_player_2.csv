"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 700000 for me and 300000 for you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe fairness should guide us. Let's share the money equally, 500000 for each. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hurting my gains. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures I get something, and the inflation will make it much harder to get a better deal in later rounds."
