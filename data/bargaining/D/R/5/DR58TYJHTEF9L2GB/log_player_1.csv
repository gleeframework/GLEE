Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor.  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each round, I figure he'll be more likely to take a small amount now rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems tempting to take $1, I know that the money is going to be worth less to Bob with each round.  If I reject, I can make a proposal in the next round and try to get a better deal for myself."

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob slightly, but still keep the majority of the money for myself.  I'm hoping that he'll see the value of getting something now, even if it's a small amount, since the money will be worth even less to him in the next round."

```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, but still keeping the vast majority of the money for myself.  The inflation is starting to really affect Bob's side of the bargain, and I believe this offer is getting closer to what he might find acceptable."
