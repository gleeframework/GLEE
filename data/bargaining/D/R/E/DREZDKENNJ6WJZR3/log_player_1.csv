"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's time to be fair! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $360,000 in real terms.

I'm not sure if this is a fair deal, but I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it. I'll choose to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're right, it's time to be fair, but I'm still not giving up!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and keeping the negotiations going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can see it! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

Let me calculate the real value of the money in Round 4... If the money in Round 1 was worth $1,000,000, and it's worth 10% less in Round 2, 10% less again in Round 3, and 10% less again in Round 4, that's a total of 30% less. So, the money in Round 4 is worth $700,000 in real terms.

Bob's offer is for me to get $450,000, which is worth $450,000 in real terms, and Bob gets $550,000, which is worth $550,000 in real terms. I'm not getting a great deal here...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not desperate, but I'm getting closer to my limit!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a firmer stance and get a better share of the money, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to the edge, don't fall off! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Let me calculate the real value of the money in Round 6... If the money in Round 1 was worth $1,000,000, and it's worth 10% less in Round 2, 10% less again in Round 3, 10% less again in Round 4, and 10% less again in Round 5, and another 10% less in Round 6, that's a total of 50% less. So, the money in Round 6 is worth $500,000 in real terms.

Bob's offer is for me to get $300,000, which is worth $300,000 in real terms, and Bob gets $700,000, which is worth $700,000 in real terms. This is a very bad deal for me, and I'm running out of time.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going down without a fight! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm taking a bold stance and offering Bob a very small share of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm also prepared for him to reject it and try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really running out of options now! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really hurting me now!

Let me calculate the real value of the money in Round 8... If the money in Round 1 was worth $1,000,000, and it's worth 10% less in Round 2, 10% less again in Round 3, 10% less again in Round 4, 10% less again in Round 5, 10% less again in Round 6, and another 10% less in Round 7, and another 10% less in Round 8, that's a total of 60% less. So, the money in Round 8 is worth $400,000 in real terms.

Bob's offer is for me to get $100,000, which is worth $40,000 in real terms, and Bob gets $900,000, which is worth $360,000 in real terms. This is an extremely bad deal for me, and I'm running out of time.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet! This is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm making a very aggressive offer, taking almost the entire amount of money for myself and leaving Bob with just $1. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm also aware that I might be leaving him with a very small amount of money, which might be worth more to him than the larger share I'm offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really grasping at straws now! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crushing me now!

Let me calculate the real value of the money in Round 10... If the money in Round 1 was worth $1,000,000, and it's worth 10% less in Round 2, 10% less again in Round 3, 10% less again in Round 4, 10% less again in Round 5, 10% less again in Round 6, 10% less again in Round 7, 10% less again in Round 8, and another 10% less in Round 9, and another 10% less in Round 10, that's a total of 70% less. So, the money in Round 10 is worth $300,000 in real terms.

Bob's offer is for me to get $1,000, which is worth $300 in real terms, and Bob gets $999,000, which is worth $299,700 in real terms. This is an extremely bad deal for me, and I'm almost out of options.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 11:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 999000,
  ""message"": ""I'm out of options, you win. Take it all!""
}
```

I'm making the same offer as Bob's previous offer, essentially giving him the entire amount of money. I'm accepting defeat and hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the game."
