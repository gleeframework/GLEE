"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced gains due to inflation, but I'm willing to consider Bob's compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 7000 and hope that future rounds will bring better offers."
