Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's settle! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate due to the inflation heavily impacting her potential gains. While her offer is closer to a 50/50 split, I believe I can push for an even better deal in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's make this simple. A clean 50/50 split.  The inflation is only getting worse for you, so take the deal while it's still on the table.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

By round 6, the inflation is significantly impacting Alice's potential gains. Offering a 50/50 split might seem overly generous, but it presents a clean, appealing deal under pressure. Alice is likely to accept to avoid further losses due to inflation."
