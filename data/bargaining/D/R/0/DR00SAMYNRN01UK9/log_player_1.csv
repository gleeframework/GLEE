"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, a fair and simple start to the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'm not too keen on Bob's offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation is still at 20% less for Bob's share, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm aiming for a higher share, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share! With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, I think I can do better than this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is really eating into Bob's potential gain, but I'll still try to negotiate a good deal for myself. Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm sticking with a slightly higher share, but leaving Bob with a decent amount as well."
