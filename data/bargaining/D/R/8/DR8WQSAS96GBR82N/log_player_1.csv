"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can finish the game if Bob accepts."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $5,000 gain in the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's worth $4,500. Bob's $5,000 gain in the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's worth $4,750.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject the offer for now.
