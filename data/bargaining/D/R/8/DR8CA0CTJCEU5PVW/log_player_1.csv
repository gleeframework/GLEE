"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping Bob will accept. I'm willing to give him a small share to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a larger share,  accepting this offer is the safest option.  Inflation is hurting my gains significantly.  I don't want to risk getting nothing by rejecting and potentially facing a worse offer in the next round."
