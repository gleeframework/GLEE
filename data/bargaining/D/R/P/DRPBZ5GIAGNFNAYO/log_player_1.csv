"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering you 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. This leaves me with $80, which is a decent chunk of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer carefully.

I accept the offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take $40, which is still a decent amount, and Bob will get $60."
