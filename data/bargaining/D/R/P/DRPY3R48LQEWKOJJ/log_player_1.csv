Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 3:1 is too extreme. This offer gives you a decent chunk, and I still get a significant portion. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
