I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid inflation.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even with the inflation factor. I'm going to reject this offer and hope to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share than in my initial proposal, but still a significant amount. This reflects the inflation that has occurred and my desire to secure a deal before it gets even worse."
