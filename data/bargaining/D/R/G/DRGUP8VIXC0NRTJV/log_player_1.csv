"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 20% less, this offer seems slightly biased towards Bob.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and I want to adjust for that, I'll make a new offer that takes that into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This offer takes into account the 20% decrease in value of Bob's gain due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, this offer seems quite favorable to Bob.

However, since I want to maximize my gain, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

This offer takes into account the 48.8% decrease in value of Bob's gain due to inflation."
