"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we can both get a decent amount and still have room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now.

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up that much. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm not happy with the 55/45 split, so I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less for me now, and 5% less for Bob.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still leaves room for negotiation."
