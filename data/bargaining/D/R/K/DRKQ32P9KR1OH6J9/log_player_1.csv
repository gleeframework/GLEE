"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65/35 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 65/35 split, but considering the inflation rates, I think it's a decent offer.
