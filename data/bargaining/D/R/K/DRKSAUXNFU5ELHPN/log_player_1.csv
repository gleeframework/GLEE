"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent share. Let's see if he accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more even, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gain, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'm taking a bigger share of the remaining money, but it's still a significant amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation really taking a toll on my potential gain, I'll have to be more careful. Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, which might be the best I can get at this point. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
