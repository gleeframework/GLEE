"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
This is a terrible deal for Bob!  While Alice gets a lot less in later rounds due to inflation, it's worth holding out for a much better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This offer ensures a fair split closer to the middle.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's be fair.  This is a better split for both of us.  Accept this and we both get more than before. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to sweeten the deal, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Bob has time on his side and should hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a generous offer considering the inflation working against you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  With inflation hitting hard, this is the best we can both do.  Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the best offer Bob is likely to get.  While a 50/50 split might seem ""fair"" earlier, Alice is right - the longer this goes on, the more the inflation eats into her share, making it less likely she'll agree to a deal favoring Bob. Taking the sure win now is the best strategic move."
