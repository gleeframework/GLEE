"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share for Bob and 80% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $4,000 is now equivalent to $3,200 in the first round's value.

I'm not too thrilled with this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept this offer.
