"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40% of the total amount, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! You took a fair offer, now it's my turn! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the sudden change in the script, but I'll consider the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll calculate the value of the offer in the new currency:

Alice gain: 400,000 x (1 - 0.20) = 320,000
Bob gain: 600,000 x (1 - 0.10) = 540,000

I'm not thrilled about the 320,000, but I'll decide based on the current situation. I'll choose to...
