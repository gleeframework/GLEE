"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a significant share, but I want to make it clear that I'm not afraid to negotiate further if needed. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up. 60/40 split? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept an offer that gives Bob 60% of the money, especially since the value of the money is decreasing faster for me. I'm willing to take a risk and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""You may have been generous, but I'm not desperate. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I've increased my share slightly, but still left a decent amount for Bob. I'm trying to convey that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't be pushed around. Let's see how Bob responds!"
