"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,

}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, and leaving $2,000 for Bob."

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
