  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise on a 50/50 split, considering the decreasing value of money. This way, we can both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
