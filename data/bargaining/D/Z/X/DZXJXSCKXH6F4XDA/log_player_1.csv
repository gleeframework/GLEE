Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was already generous. This is a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. I'm offering you 35 which is better than you'll get if we stall further. Let's close this deal now.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems we both want a larger share. I'm willing to meet you halfway to avoid further losses from inflation. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is the same as Bob's initial offer, the impact of inflation is becoming significant. Accepting 60 now is better than risking further losses and potentially getting a worse offer later."
