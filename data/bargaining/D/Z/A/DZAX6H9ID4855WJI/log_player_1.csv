"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think 60/40 is a fair split considering we're starting with a large sum. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
