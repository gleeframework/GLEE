"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share now, but still fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $380,000.

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a larger share, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount. I'll accept this offer.
