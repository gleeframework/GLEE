"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  While it's not exactly a 50/50 split, it's a fairer reflection of the fact that I'm risking more due to the inflation.  We can both still come out ahead. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
