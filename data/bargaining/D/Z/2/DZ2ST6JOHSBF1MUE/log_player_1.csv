"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, giving Bob a significant chunk of the money. I figure this will hopefully encourage him to accept in the first round, avoiding any inflation issues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair given the inflation. It's better to accept this than to risk further rounds and potentially get less due to inflation."
