"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave 30 dollars for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a more balanced approach. Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of 40 dollars is actually worth 38 dollars in real value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. I'd like to propose a 50/50 split in the next round.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and suggesting a 50/50 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the 5% inflation from the previous round, my gain of 40 dollars is now worth 38 dollars in real value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal share!""
}
```

I'm now proposing a 50/50 split, which I hope Bob will find more acceptable."
