Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Alice a slightly smaller share, hoping she'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share,  I need to be realistic about inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than my initial goal."
