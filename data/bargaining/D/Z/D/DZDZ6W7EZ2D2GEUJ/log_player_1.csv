Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a more even approach. 550 for me, 450 for you. We both get a decent share, and it's still more for you than the last offer!  Don't let inflation eat away at your gains!  
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
