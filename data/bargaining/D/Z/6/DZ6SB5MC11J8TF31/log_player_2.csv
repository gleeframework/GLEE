Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this division reflects the urgency for us both to secure a good portion of the money before inflation eats away at its value.

# Alice gain: 650000

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money more evenly, taking into account the inflation risk. Let's reach a deal before the money loses too much value.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your offer doesn't reflect the faster rate at which my share loses value. This offer is a compromise, securing a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
