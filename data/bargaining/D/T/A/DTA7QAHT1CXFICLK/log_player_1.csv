Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will impact Bob more heavily in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
