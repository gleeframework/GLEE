"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $200,000. I'm framing it as a fair start, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's see if we can do better than 4:1! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll be getting $500,000 * 0.9 = $450,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
