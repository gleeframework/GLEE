"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. This seems fair and a good starting point considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I understand the inflation factor, a 40/60 split is not acceptable to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I propose a 45/55 split. This is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation factor while still ensuring a fairer distribution than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While I understand the inflation is increasing, a 30/70 split is unacceptable.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000} 
```

I'm willing to go down to a 40/60 split, but I won't go any lower.  I think this is a fair compromise given the increasing inflation rates."
