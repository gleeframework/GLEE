Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the impact of inflation is significant over time. I need to aim for a larger share in the earlier rounds to maximize my gains."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I've made a slight adjustment. Let's settle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting worse for me with each round. I need to hold out for a better deal, but I need to be careful not to push Alice too far."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a compromise. It accounts for inflation and is fair to both of us.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts, but I'm willing to take a bigger share to end this. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a difficult decision, and getting very risky. However, accepting this offer would mean I'm losing a significant chunk of the potential gain due to inflation. I need to hold out hope that Alice will be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution considering how much inflation is affecting us both. Let's end this now before it's too late.""
