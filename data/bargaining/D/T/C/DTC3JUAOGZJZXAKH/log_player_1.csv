"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a relatively generous starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $600,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I should accept this offer, especially since Bob's gain is still a bit too high. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain slightly, but still trying to keep the offer reasonable, given the inflation. Your turn, Bob!"

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $550,000 is now worth 55% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $450,000 is now worth 45% of what it was in the first round.

I'm starting to feel a bit more desperate, but I'm not ready to give in yet...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'm not convinced that this offer is significantly better than my previous one, and I'd like to try to negotiate further."

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, Bob. This is a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm sticking to a similar split as my previous offer, but with a slight adjustment to try to nudge the deal in my favor. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50

This is a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise, considering the inflation. I'm not sure if I should push for a better deal or accept this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns due to inflation."
