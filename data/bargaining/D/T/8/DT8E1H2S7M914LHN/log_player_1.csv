"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000

Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the adjusted amounts. In this case, the offer is:

* Alice gain: $5000 (pre-inflation) = $5000 / 0.95 = $5263.16 (inflation-adjusted)
* Bob gain: $5000 (pre-inflation) = $5000 / 0.80 = $6250 (inflation-adjusted)
