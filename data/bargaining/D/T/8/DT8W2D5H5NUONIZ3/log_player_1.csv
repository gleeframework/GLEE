"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and leaves $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 300,000 x 0.95 = 285,000
* Bob's gain: 700,000 x 0.95 = 665,000

I'll reject this offer.

Round 3

```
{

This offer gives me $550,000 and leaves $450,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 5% decrease in each round:

Round 1: $1,000,000
Round 2: $1,000,000 x 0.95 = $950,000
Round 3: $950,000 x 0.95 = $902,500
Round 4: $902,500 x 0.85 = $767,125

Now, considering the 14.26% decrease from Round 3 to Round 4, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 350,000 x 0.85 = 297,500
* Bob's gain: 650,000 x 0.85 = 552,500

I'll reject this offer.

This offer gives me $500,000 and leaves $500,000 for Bob, splitting the remaining amount evenly."
