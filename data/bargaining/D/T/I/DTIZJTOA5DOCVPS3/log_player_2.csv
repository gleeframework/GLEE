"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was tempting, but ultimately unfair. Let's be reasonable - this split accounts for the time value and gives us both a good deal."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting the first offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. While 60/40 seems fair in principle, the time pressure element means Bob loses a significant amount of potential value by accepting.
* **Counter-offer:** This offer aims to be more equitable while still being advantageous to Bob. 
    * **Time Value:**  Recognizing the 20% depreciation, getting slightly more than half now is better than potentially getting less later.
    * **Negotiation:** Starting with a stronger offer leaves room for potential compromise in future rounds. 

By offering a more balanced split and providing a clear rationale, Bob increases the chances of Alice accepting, thus securing a better outcome than the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more than fair deal. Don't let the money lose more value! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The money is now worth significantly less than in round 1. Waiting longer carries a substantial risk of further depreciation.
* **Improved Offer:** Alice's offer is better than her initial 60/40 split. While it still favors her, the difference is less drastic.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a significantly better deal in Round 4 is very risky. Alice knows the value is decreasing, so her offer is unlikely to improve drastically.

In this scenario, accepting a slightly less favorable but relatively decent offer minimizes the negative impact of inflation."
