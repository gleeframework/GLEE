"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering to give Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small share, hoping to get a larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain is now worth less, so I'm more willing to compromise. Since Bob is offering a 50-50 split, I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation.
