"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split. Since the money is worth less with each round, it's in both our interests to come to an agreement soon. This offer gives me a bit more, but you still get a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
