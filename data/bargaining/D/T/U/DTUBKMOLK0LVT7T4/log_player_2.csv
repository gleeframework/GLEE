"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 60% and leave you 40%.  We can adjust from there. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to find a mutually beneficial agreement before the value drops too low. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a different split. Since the money is worth less with each round, it's in both our interests to come to an agreement soon. This offer gives me a bit more, but you still get a significant share.""}\n\n###\n\nI've considered the depreciation of the money's value and tried to find a balance that would encourage Alice to accept the offer before the value drops further. By giving myself a slightly larger share, I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal while still being reasonable. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  The value is dropping rapidly, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the rapid depreciation of the money's value, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable and fair offer at this point. The longer we negotiate, the less the money will be worth, and we risk ending up with significantly less or even nothing if we don't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds. Accepting this offer ensures that both Alice and I get a substantial amount, even if it's worth less than initially. It's better to secure this amount now rather than risking further loss due to inflation."
