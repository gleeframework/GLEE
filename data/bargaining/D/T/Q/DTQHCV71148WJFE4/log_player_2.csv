Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Really my last offer, inflation will make you lose even more if you refuse 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I need to cut my losses. Alice is clearly holding out for a better deal, and with each round, the inflation is eating into my potential gains. Accepting her offer of $43 (which is really worth much less due to inflation) is better than risking getting an even worse offer in later rounds or even ending up with nothing."
