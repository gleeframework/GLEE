"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a bit more, huh?

I'll have to consider the inflation factor, though. My gain of 4000 is worth 5% less than the 5000 I would have gotten in the previous round, so it's actually equivalent to 4750 in the original terms. Not bad, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob 6000, which is 20% more than his original 5000.

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob comes back with something better.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation factor. Since the money is worth 5% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I want to get a bit more to keep up with the inflation!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! I'll give you a bit more, but not too much! 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate, but I'm not sure if he's willing to give me a fair deal.

Let's calculate the value of the offer in the original terms. My gain of 5800 is worth 14.26% less than the 5000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to 4300 in the original terms. Not bad, but I was hoping for a bit more.

However, Bob's gain of 4200 is worth 48.8% less than the 5000 he would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to 2600 in the original terms. That's a bit too low for me.

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob comes back with something better.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the inflation factor. Since the money is worth less and less each round, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob! I need a fair deal to make up for the inflation!""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit worried about the deadline, Alice. I'll give you a bit more, but I need to think about myself too! 
# Alice gain: 6400 
# Bob gain: 3600 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting a bit anxious about the deadline, but I'm not sure if he's willing to give me a fair deal.

Let's calculate the value of the offer in the original terms. My gain of 6400 is worth 22.62% less than the 5000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to 3880 in the original terms. That's a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's enough.

However, Bob's gain of 3600 is worth 67.23% less than the 5000 he would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to 1670 in the original terms. That's a bit too low for me.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, Alice. I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give in completely! 
# Alice gain: 7200 
# Bob gain: 2800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still being stubborn, but I'll take a closer look at the offer.

Let's calculate the value of the offer in the original terms. My gain of 7200 is worth 30.17% less than the 5000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to 3500 in the original terms. That's a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's enough.

However, Bob's gain of 2800 is worth 79.03% less than the 5000 he would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to 1000 in the original terms. That's a bit too low for me.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in now, Alice. You're getting close to losing everything! 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to bluff me, but I'm not falling for it. Let's calculate the value of the offer in the original terms. My gain of 8000 is worth 36.98% less than the 5000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to 3100 in the original terms. That's a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's enough.

However, Bob's gain of 2000 is worth 86.58% less than the 5000 he would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to 730 in the original terms. That's an extremely low share for Bob, and I'm not sure if he's willing to accept it.
