"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair and simple solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

In this round, my gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $475,000. Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $450,000.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. 

In this round, my gain of $500,000 is worth 90.25% of its original value, which is $450,250. Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 81% of its original value, which is $405,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want to be the majority shareholder.""
}
