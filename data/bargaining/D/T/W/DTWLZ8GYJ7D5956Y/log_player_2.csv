Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but you should consider accepting soon, I'm not getting more generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the effects of inflation are becoming more severe, Alice's offer is barely budging.  It's clear she's trying to take advantage of the situation. By continuing to reject her offers, I'm hoping to signal that I'm willing to walk away with nothing if I don't get a fair deal. There's still time to negotiate, but I need to put pressure on Alice."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  The inflation is hurting me more each round.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is my final offer.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this stage, it's crucial to send a strong message to Alice. By offering a 50/50 split and labeling it as my final offer, I'm conveying the seriousness of the situation.  It emphasizes that I'm willing to walk away if necessary.  Delaying further only benefits Alice while my potential gains diminish."
