"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less for Bob in each round, I'm hoping this is appealing enough for him to accept, but I'm also leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob has increased his share, my share has decreased significantly, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 5500,  which is closer to the 60/40 split I originally proposed.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, while still maintaining a fair share for myself.  The declining value of the money means I need to secure a better deal for myself in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the money is worth less for both of us,  my share has dropped significantly.  I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split in Bob's favor.  I will try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  While I'm still losing value due to inflation, this seems like the fairest option given the current situation.  I'm hoping that after several rounds of back and forth, Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  My share has been reduced further, and I am not willing to accept such a lopsided division, especially given the significant inflation that has occurred. I believe I can still negotiate a more equitable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split.  The money continues to lose value for both of us, and I'm trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share than the 50/50 split from the previous round, but I'm hoping Bob will also show some compromise after multiple rounds of rejections."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. My share has been reduced to 3000, which is significantly less than what I proposed in the previous round, and much lower than what I initially aimed for.  While the money is losing value for both of us, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction. I will continue to try to reach a more equitable agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm offering a 40/60 split.  The money continues to lose value for both of us, but I'm willing to compromise further in order to reach an agreement.  I believe this offer is fair, given that my share has been significantly reduced due to inflation, while Bob's share is also lower than his initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  My share has been reduced to 2500, which is significantly less than what I proposed in the previous round, and much lower than what I initially aimed for.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}
```

Given the continuous inflation and the fact that Bob seems unwilling to budge on his initial demand, I'm lowering my offer to 3500. This is a significant reduction from my initial proposal, but it's the best I can offer given the current circumstances.  I hope this is enough to convince Bob to agree and end this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While the money is worth less for both of us,  my share has dropped significantly.  I'm not willing to accept a 20/80 split in Bob's favor.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to compromise.  We've both lost a significant amount of value due to inflation, and it seems like he's using that to his advantage.  While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach an agreement, I'd rather have nothing than accept such an unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 12.
Round 13
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000}
```

This is my final offer.  I've already made significant concessions due to inflation, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the value in reaching an agreement, even if it means a slightly smaller share for him.  If he rejects this, we'll both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 13.

Round 14
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 74.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.67% less than in the first round.

```

I'm rejecting this offer.  My share has been reduced to 1500, which is significantly less than what I proposed in the previous round, and much lower than what I initially aimed for. While the money is losing value for both of us, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to compromise, and I'd rather have nothing than accept such an unfair deal."

Round 15
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 2500, ""bob_gain"": 7500}
```

This is my final offer.  The money continues to lose value for both of us, and I'm willing to accept a very low share to end this game.  I'm hoping Bob sees that further rejection will leave us both with nothing.  I'm not willing to accept less than 2500, but I'm hoping Bob will finally compromise."
