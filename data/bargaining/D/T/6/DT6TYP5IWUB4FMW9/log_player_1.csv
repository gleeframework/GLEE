"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10 to get started!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 10% share, which is $100,000, and keeping the remaining 90% for myself, which is $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $450,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
