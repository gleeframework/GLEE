"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and leaving $40 for Bob. This is a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair and reasonable proposal to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's my turn now! I'm going to propose a fairer split, with 60 for me and 40 for you.  Let's see if you're willing to be more reasonable this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to mirror my previous offer, but with a slight twist. I'll consider his proposal.

However, I'm not convinced that this is a significantly better offer than my initial proposal. I'm willing to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to accept a 60-40 split just yet. Can we try to find a middle ground?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to meet him halfway.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. 50-50 seems like a fair split to me.""
}
```"
