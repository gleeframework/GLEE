Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 900k - 100k split. I'm aiming for a big chunk of the money since it's the first round and inflation hasn't kicked in yet. I'm hoping Bob will be happy with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, this is a fair split considering the inflation factor and the risk of getting nothing if we reach the 12th round. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant amount of money for me."
