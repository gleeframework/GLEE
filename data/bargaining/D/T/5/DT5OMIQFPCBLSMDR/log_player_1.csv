"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $40 and kept $60 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split. Let's see if Bob accepts or decides to proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something more reasonable. This offer won't be as good next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less to both of us due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed and see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $43 and kept $57 for myself, taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of the money for both of us. I included a message suggesting that this is a good deal for Bob, given the circumstances. Let's see if Bob accepts or decides to proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This is the best you'll get with inflation eating our gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI decided to accept Bob's offer. Given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable deal at this point. Continuing to negotiate may lead to further losses due to inflation, so I'll settle for this offer."
