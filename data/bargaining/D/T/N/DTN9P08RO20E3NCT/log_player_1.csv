I'm proposing to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This is a good starting point, as it gives Bob something but still gives me the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred more, the inflation makes it risky to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting a 50/50 split is a good way to guarantee a decent amount, especially given the uncertainty about how much Bob is being impacted by inflation."
