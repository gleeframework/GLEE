"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting with a fair split, let's see if you can do better""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm starting with a fair split, hoping to set the tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $32.

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but it's an even split, so I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%), so I'll aim for a higher value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing an even split, but I'm hinting that I'm willing to negotiate further."
