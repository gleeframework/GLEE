Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 90/10 split!  I figure with the inflation factor, I'll do better in the long run by taking most of the money now.  Let's see what happens!"

I'm still going to try to get the lion's share of the money.  But I'm going to be a little more reasonable with Bob since he rejected my previous offer.  I'm going to offer him 20% of the money.  I figure the inflation will still work in my favor in the long run.  Let's see what happens!"

I'm still going to try for the majority of the money, but I'm starting to get a little worried about the inflation. I'll offer Bob 30% this time. If he rejects it, I'm going to have to get more aggressive in my proposals."

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, but I'm still going to try to get a good share of the money.  I'll offer Bob 40% this time. This is probably the last time I'll offer him more than 40% of the money."
