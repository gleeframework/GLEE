I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split, keeping the majority for myself since I get to propose first. It's a good starting point, but I'm ready to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to accept the 50/50 split. Even though Bob's money is worth less due to inflation, we are both getting the same amount and I'm guaranteed to get at least 5000.  There's no guarantee I'll get anything if we keep going."
