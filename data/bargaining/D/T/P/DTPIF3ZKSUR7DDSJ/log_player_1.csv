"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I need to think carefully about the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 75/25 split. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me again, I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! With the money being worth 48.8% less for me, I need to be careful with my decisions.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 35/65 split. I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to give up enough to make it worth my while. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me, I need to be more aggressive with my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to get a bit desperate, Bob. I need a better deal than this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48/52 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping that Bob will take pity on me and accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to give up too much, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my proposal! With the money being worth 67.23% less for me, I need to be extremely careful with my decisions.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 40/60 split. I'm not willing to accept a deal that's so unfavorable to me, especially considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 67.23% less for me, I'm getting desperate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, Bob. I need a better deal now or I'll be left with nothing.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping that Bob will take pity on me and accept this offer, but I'm not getting my hopes up!"
