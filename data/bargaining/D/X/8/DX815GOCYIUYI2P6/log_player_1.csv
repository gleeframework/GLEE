"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it.  I want to see if he's willing to take a small share to avoid the risk of losing everything later on.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than what I would get if we go to the next round.  Although it's not ideal, it's better to secure 5000 than risk getting nothing."
