"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not happy with this offer, I want a bigger share. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we should meet in the middle, but I want a bit more since I'm taking the risk of the money devaluing faster for me.""}\n\n###\nLet's see what Alice thinks of this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the money evenly this time. We both lose money with each passing round, so I think a 50/50 split is the best way to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nA 50/50 split seems fair, and considering the inflation, I think it's best to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation."
