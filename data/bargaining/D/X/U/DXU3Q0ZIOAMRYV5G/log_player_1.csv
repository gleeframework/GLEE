"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI have offered Bob $4000 and I will take $6000. I believe this is a fair division, and I hope Bob will accept it. The message I attached is ""Let's divide fairly"". Let's see how Bob reacts!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair deal, but the declining value makes it important to act fast.  This offer compensates me for the shrinking pot. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI have decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money is decreasing, I believe I can get a better deal than $4500. Bob's argument about the declining value is valid, but I'm not convinced that his offer is fair. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nI have offered Bob $4200 and I will take $5800. Considering the declining value of the money, I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. My message to Bob is ""Let's find a middle ground"". I hope he will consider this offer seriously."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and our money is losing value quickly. This offer is a good compromise to ensure we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI have decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer of $4800 for me and $5200 for him is not convincing enough, considering the compromise I offered in the previous round. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."

As the rounds go by, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm trying to be reasonable with my offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the urgency of the situation and accept this proposal.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  We need to agree now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI have decided to accept Bob's offer. Given the rapid decline in the value of the money, a 50/50 split seems like a fair and reasonable option at this point. Bob's message indicates that this is his final offer, and I don't want to risk losing everything due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures that I will receive at least $5000, which is better than risking further negotiations and potentially ending up with nothing."
