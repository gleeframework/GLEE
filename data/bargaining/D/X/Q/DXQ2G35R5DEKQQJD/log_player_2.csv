Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the attempt at compromise, but this back and forth isn't beneficial for either of us. I'm offering a slightly better deal for you than your last, but I need you to understand the urgency. Each round costs us both money. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure from the inflation and is trying to lowball me.  While her offers are incrementally getting better, I need to push back harder.  She's losing value far faster than I am."

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the time pressure, but I also know the value of a dollar. Let's be fair to both of us. This offer acknowledges the lost value you're facing while ensuring we both walk away with a respectable amount.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a significant share. This offer is a final attempt to find a middle ground.  You gain a bit more, acknowledging the time pressure. If you refuse, we're both walking away with significantly less. Let's be smart about this. 
# Bob gain: 487500 
# Alice gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to cut my losses. Alice is right, we're both losing out with each passing round. While her offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I might get in further rounds if she starts lowballing even more aggressively. Accepting now guarantees a decent amount, and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
