Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'm taking the majority, but I'm giving you a fair share.  Accept this and we'll both be happy. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than the first round, he's still taking the lion's share. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a lopsided split."
