"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. With the 5% inflation, my $30 gain is now worth $28.50. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better one. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more appealing offer. Considering the inflation, my gain will be worth 4.375% of the original amount (95% of 100% * 95% = 90.25%). I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share to make it more attractive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```"
