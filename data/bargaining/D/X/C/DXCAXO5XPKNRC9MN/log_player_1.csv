"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values, I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer. Since my gain of $475,000 is worth 90% of the original $475,000 (due to the 10% inflation), and Bob's gain of $525,000 is worth 105% of the original $525,000 (due to the 5% inflation), I'll choose to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This offer gives me 40% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 60%."
