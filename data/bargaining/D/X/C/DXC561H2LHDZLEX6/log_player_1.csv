"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $300,000, which is 30% of the original $1,000,000. This is a relatively small share, but considering the inflation, I might have to be more aggressive in my counteroffer.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll offer a slightly higher share, but still keep some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess my priorities. I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, and it's getting late in the game.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, I'll take it, but I'm not thrilled about it...""
}
