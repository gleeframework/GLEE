"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While the money I gain is worth less, it's still a significant improvement over my previous offer (95 to 20).
* **Alice's position:** Alice has also lost value due to inflation, making this offer more appealing to her. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the game means risking getting a worse offer or even nothing at all. Accepting guarantees me some money."
