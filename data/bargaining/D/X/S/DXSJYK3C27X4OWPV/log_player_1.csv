Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

""decision"": ""reject""

I need to hold out for a better offer. While the value is decreasing, accepting such a low amount would set a bad precedent and likely lead to even worse offers from Bob."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know the inflation is killing your share, but I'll take one more stab at getting a better deal 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but I need to accept. 

While Bob's offer is far from ideal, the decreasing value due to inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Bob will offer even less in the next round, and the value of my share will continue to plummet. Accepting this offer cuts my losses and prevents an even worse outcome."
