"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less to begin with.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a decent share, and I'm taking the majority of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took less in the first round, now it's my turn to take the lead. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $300,000 (initially $300,000, but now worth $240,000 due to inflation)
* Bob gain: $700,000 (initially $700,000, but now worth $560,000 due to inflation)

I'll reject this offer since I'm not getting a fair share considering the inflation. I'll make a new proposal.

  ""message"": ""Too biased towards you, I want a better split.""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,

  ""message"": ""Middle ground, let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob gain: 800000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the majority, but I'll give you a small share.

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Bob gain: $900,000 (initially $900,000, but now worth $297,600 due to inflation)

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting a very small share, and the difference between our gains is getting too large. I'll make a new proposal.

* Bob gain: $950,000 (initially $950,000, but now worth $192,200 due to inflation)

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting an extremely small share, and the difference between our gains is enormous. I'll make a new proposal.
