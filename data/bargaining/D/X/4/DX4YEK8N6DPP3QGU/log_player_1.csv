"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

I think meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd rather get a slightly better deal, considering I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to be more generous than Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more too! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings!

Considering the new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more ground. However, Bob's offer is slightly more generous than my previous one, and I'm getting desperate to finalize the deal.
