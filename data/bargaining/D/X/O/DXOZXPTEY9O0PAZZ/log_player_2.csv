Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While the deal is slightly better, accepting now would mean I lose a significant chunk of the potential gain compared to the initial rounds.  I need to push for a more even split while it's still worthwhile for me."
