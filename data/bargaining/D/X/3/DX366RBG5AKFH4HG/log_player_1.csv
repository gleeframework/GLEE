"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 400k. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering to keep 60% of the initial amount ($600,000) and give Bob 40% ($400,000). This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth $285,000 (0.95 x $300,000).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. I think I can do better than this, but I'll accept for now.
