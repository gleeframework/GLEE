"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to be more careful with my decision, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain.

Since Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was to split the money evenly, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer in round 3, taking into account the inflation effect.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous last round, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give you the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect reducing the value of Bob's gain even further, I'll have to be cautious and consider my next move carefully.

However, Bob's offer in round 4 seems more favorable to him, and I'm not sure if I should take it. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 4 was to give him a larger share, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer in round 5, taking into account the inflation effect.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm not going to give you the majority. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, Alice. I think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect reducing the value of Bob's gain even further, I'll have to be careful not to give him too much.

However, Bob's offer in round 6 is quite generous, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping to get a decent share of the money before time runs out."
