"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

{

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money ($6,000) and give Bob 40% ($4,000). I think this is a reasonable and fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, reflecting my increased risk in this game. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
