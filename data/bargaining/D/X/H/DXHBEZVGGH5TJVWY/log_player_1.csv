"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{

  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate from there!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and I'll take the remaining 80%. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good starting point for negotiations."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
