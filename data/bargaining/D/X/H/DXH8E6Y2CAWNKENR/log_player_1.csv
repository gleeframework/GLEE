"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping to get a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more skewed in his favor, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm trying to take a bit more for myself, but not so much that Bob will reject it outright."
