"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

This is a relatively even split, giving each of us $4,000 and $6,000, respectively. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take a bigger share, huh?

I'll reject this offer. I don't think I should give up $8,000 to Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a good compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and giving Bob a reasonable share. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share to secure my future! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is getting a bit desperate, it seems!

I'm not convinced that I should give up $7,000 to Bob. This offer is quite lopsided in his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a bigger share and keeping a reasonable amount for myself. Let's see if this offer is more appealing to him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is getting aggressive!

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with only $1,000. That's a ridiculously small share, and I'm not going to get taken advantage of like that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. No more negotiations, just a fair share for both of us.""
}
```

I'm trying to be reasonable and find a compromise that works for both of us. A 50/50 split seems like a fair and simple solution."
