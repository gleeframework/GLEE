Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get a better share than your last offer.  Let's split it closer to 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob is offering me 55% of the money and taking 45% for himself, but due to inflation, his gain is actually worth 27.1% less than the original amount. Considering this, his offer is not that bad, but I think I can still try to negotiate for a slightly better deal in the next round.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that with each passing round, the money is worth less and less for Bob, which may motivate him to accept a less favorable deal. On the other hand, I don't want to risk losing a relatively good offer.\n\nAfter weighing the pros and cons, I decide to reject the offer and try my luck in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how Bob reacts to my rejection."
