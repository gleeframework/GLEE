Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

While the inflation hurts, accepting this offer is the best option.  Any further rounds will lead to a significantly lower gain for Bob due to the continuous inflation."
