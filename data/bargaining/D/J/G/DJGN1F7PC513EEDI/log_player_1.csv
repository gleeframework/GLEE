I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems like a reasonable starting point, as I'm taking into account the higher inflation rate I'll face in future rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal.  Even with the inflation, it's not worth it to accept such a drastic change in the split. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

I'm proposing a 50/50 split this time. The inflation is starting to hurt, and I want to avoid going through more rounds and potentially losing even more value.  A 50/50 split seems fair considering the circumstances and hopefully Bob will see it that way."
