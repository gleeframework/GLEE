"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that the money will lose value quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a bad deal for me, even with the inflation. I will reject this and see if I can get a better offer in round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
``` 

I'm going to reduce my demand slightly to 80/20, hoping Bob will see that continuing to reject offers will only lead to both of us losing more money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is still a terrible deal for me. Even with the inflation, 20% is far too little for me to accept. I'll continue to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
``` 

I'm reducing my share again to 70/30. We are losing money with each round, and this is getting close to a point where it might make sense for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the inflation is hitting hard, 30% is still not enough for me to accept. I'll try one more time to make a better deal in Round 7."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
``` 

I'm offering 60/40.  We're both losing money, and this is my last attempt to get a fair share. I'm hoping Bob realizes that we both need to compromise."
