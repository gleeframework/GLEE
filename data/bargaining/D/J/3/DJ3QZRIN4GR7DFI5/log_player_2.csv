Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money is worth 19% less for me (Bob) and 36% less for Alice compared to the first round.

### Step 2: Calculate the effective value of the money for both players
For me (Bob), the money is worth 81% of its original value (100% - 19% = 81%). For Alice, the money is worth 64% of its original value (100% - 36% = 64%).

### Step 3: Determine a fair offer considering the inflation
Given the decreasing value of money for both players, a fair offer should take into account the relative loss of value. Since Alice is more affected by inflation, I should offer her a slightly higher amount to compensate for her loss.

### Step 4: Decide on the offer
I will offer Alice 5000 dollars and take 5000 dollars for myself. This offer is closer to the original 50-50 split but still acknowledges the impact of inflation on both players.

### Step 5: Create the offer in the required JSON format
The offer will be: {""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, let's meet in the middle and adjust for our losses.""}

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, let's meet in the middle and adjust for our losses.""}"
