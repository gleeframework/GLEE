  ""bob_gain"": 50,

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, $40 is equivalent to $44 in the first round. Considering the current value, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.
