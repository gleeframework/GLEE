"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to start. This gives you a decent share and avoids us losing money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see what Alice proposes next."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, time is money, literally!  I'm increasing my offer slightly to 65/35.  Let's close this deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not happy with the split. We can definitely find a more equitable way to divide the money. Let's see what she offers next."
