Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic - I'm losing money slower than you, so I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. This offer is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""While I understand your point, Bob, this offer is still not acceptable. Let's try to find a more balanced solution."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Accepting this offer would set a bad precedent, making it seem like I'm willing to accept increasingly worse deals. 
* **Time Still Factor:**  While Bob loses money slower, the value for both of us is still decreasing. It's in both our interests to settle sooner rather than later.
* **Aim for Middle Ground:** My goal is to negotiate a deal closer to the middle, not simply accept an offer significantly skewed in Bob's favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we need to find a compromise.  A 50/50 split ensures we both leave with something substantial. Let's not risk losing more to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Counter:** Offering a 50/50 split is a clear counter-proposal that addresses Bob's desire for a ""fair"" deal. 
* **Time Pressure:** By emphasizing the shrinking pot, I'm subtly reminding Bob that each round makes accepting *any* offer more appealing. 
* **Clean and Simple:** A 50/50 split is easy to understand and leaves less room for argument, potentially making it more attractive to Bob."
