"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, 60-40 my way!  It's fair, considering I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a chance!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept a 60-40 split in favor of Bob, especially since I made a more generous offer in the first round. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. 55-45 split is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, with me getting 55% and Bob getting 45%. This should be more appealing than his previous offer."
