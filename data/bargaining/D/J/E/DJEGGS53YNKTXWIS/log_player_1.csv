Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000$ for myself and giving Bob 100,000$. I think it's a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
