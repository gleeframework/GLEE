"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of 70 is actually worth 63 (70 * 0.9). Bob's gain of 30 is still 30.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd rather negotiate further. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk, but I need a better share to compensate for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80/20 split, hoping Bob will accept or be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! With the 27.1% inflation, my gain of 75 is actually worth 54.68 (75 * 0.727). Bob's gain of 25 is still 25.

Considering the inflation, this offer is actually a better deal for me than my previous one, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I'll try to negotiate one more time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting close to my limit, but I need a better deal to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing an 85/15 split, hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm not going to give up my last bit of leverage 
# Alice gain: 78 
# Bob gain: 22 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll! With the 40.95% inflation, my gain of 78 is actually worth 46.09 (78 * 0.587). Bob's gain of 22 is still 22.

I'm getting close to the point where I'd rather accept a bad deal than risk getting even less in the next round. Considering the inflation, this offer is actually a decent deal for me, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better one.
