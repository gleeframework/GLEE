"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous, split. I'm confident we can come to a more mutually beneficial arrangement in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept such a lopsided split.  I'm confident we can negotiate a better deal for myself in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split, acknowledging your initial offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is fair considering inflation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but further rounds might be less favorable for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is fair considering the inflation and the possibility of a less favorable outcome in the future. It's a reasonable compromise."
