"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want to make a good start! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's money being worth 10% less, I'll have to consider the value of the offer carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 30% gain for myself, considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the lead, but I'm willing to give you a small share!""
}
```

I'm making a more aggressive offer this time, taking 80% of the remaining money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also leaving a small share for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I want to keep some for myself! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to reassess the value of the offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

The 75% gain for me seems like a good compromise, considering the decreasing value of money over time. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
