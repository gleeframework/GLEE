"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

This is a relatively even split, but I'm proposing that I get a slightly larger share to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd like to aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

However, Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept this offer.
