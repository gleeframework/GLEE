"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, but I'll be taking most of the pie.  You get a small share now, but remember, every round you wait, it's worth less to you.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""That's a pretty uneven split you proposed Alice! Let's be reasonable. I'm suggesting a 75/25 split in my favor.  It's still in your best interest to accept now, as the pot shrinks for both of us the longer we play.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the money 60/40.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate.  But 60/40 is still too generous to you.  I'm proposing 65/35.  Don't forget, the clock is ticking, and this money is losing value for me every round.""}
