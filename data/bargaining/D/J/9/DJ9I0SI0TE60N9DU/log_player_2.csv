"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. With inflation, the money is worth less each round, but I'm willing to take that risk to potentially get a larger share. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth 10% less to me and 20% less to Alice, I'll try to take advantage of that and offer a slightly more favorable deal to myself.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 55% for me and 45% for you is a fair deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. We both lose value with each round, so a 50/50 split is the fairest option right now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Alice's offer this round. Given the increasing impact of inflation on both of our gains, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise to avoid further devaluation of the money. It's better to secure half of the original amount now than to risk losing more value in subsequent rounds."
