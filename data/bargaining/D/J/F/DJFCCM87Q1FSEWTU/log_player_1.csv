"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, a fair deal for me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to consider the equivalent value of the offer in terms of the original $100. If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is equivalent to $50 in the original value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as I was hoping to get more. But I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the lead, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I'm not getting less than that. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really hitting me hard!

Let's calculate the equivalent value of the offer in the original $100. If I accept this offer, I'll get $45, which is equivalent to... *sigh*...only $23.52 in the original value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger risk, but I need to get a better deal. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $100, leaving Bob with 30%."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 35, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

Let's calculate the equivalent value of the offer in the original $100. If I accept this offer, I'll get $35, which is equivalent to... *sigh*...only $11.53 in the original value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'm running out of time and the value of the money is dwindling fast.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll and the value of the money plummeting, I'll try to be more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a huge risk, but I need to get a better deal. This is my last chance.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the remaining $100, leaving Bob with 20%. It's a bold move, but I'm desperate to get a good deal before the money becomes almost worthless."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 30, it's the last chance for a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is almost gone!

Let's calculate the equivalent value of the offer in the original $100. If I accept this offer, I'll get $30, which is equivalent to... *sigh*...only $6.14 in the original value.

It's a small amount, but it's better than nothing. I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing everything.
