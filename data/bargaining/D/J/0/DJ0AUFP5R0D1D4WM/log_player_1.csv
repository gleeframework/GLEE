"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40% of the $100, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about the 40% offer. Considering the inflation, Bob's 60% offer is actually a better deal for him than it was in the first round.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly more generous split, hoping Bob will accept this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

Considering the drastic reduction in value of the money Bob gains, I'm not too thrilled about the 45% offer. However, it's still a decent deal, and I don't want to risk rejecting it and getting an even worse offer.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
