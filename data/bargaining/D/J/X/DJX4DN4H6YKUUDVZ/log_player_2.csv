Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

```

It's painful, but at this point, the inflation is eating away at Bob's potential gains faster than Alice is being stubborn. Accepting a 44/56 split now is better than risking getting even less later, or even nothing if the rounds run out."
