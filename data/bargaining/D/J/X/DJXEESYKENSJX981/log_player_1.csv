Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking 900,000 and giving Bob 100,000.  I figure this gives me a good chunk of the money, and Bob still gets something.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, accepting this offer is the best choice. The inflation penalty is likely to hurt me more in the next round, and this still gives me a decent amount of money."
