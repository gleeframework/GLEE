"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point, considering the game is still in its early stages."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to split it down the middle, which is a reasonable proposal. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can end the game."
