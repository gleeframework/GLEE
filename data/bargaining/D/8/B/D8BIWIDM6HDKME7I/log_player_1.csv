Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I think this is more reflective of the game's dynamics. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a better deal than your previous offer, considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable and end this here.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical. This offer gives you a good deal considering the ongoing inflation.  We should settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation and secure a larger share while being aware of the inflation affecting me.  I need to hold out for a better offer, even though the value is decreasing. Accepting this would mean letting Bob win and getting significantly less than the initial offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair 50/50 split. Let's end this now before inflation eats further into the value. It's a good deal for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me because of the inflation. Offering a 50/50 split is fair and might be the best way to get Bob to agree before the value drops further. It emphasizes the mutual benefit of ending the game sooner."
