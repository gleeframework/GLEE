"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, I'll take the lower amount, you can have the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, with me taking $70 and Bob getting $30. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $32. Bob's gain of $60 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $57.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a bit more generous than my previous one. I'll accept it.
