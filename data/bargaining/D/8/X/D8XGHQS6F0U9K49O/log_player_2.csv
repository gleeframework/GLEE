```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Both our potential gains decrease each round. It's in our best interest to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.
* **Alice's Discount:** Alice's perception of the money's value decreases slower than mine. This means an offer slightly favoring me now will look more appealing to her than it will in later rounds.
* **Strong Opening:** Offering slightly more than Alice's initial offer signals that I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal but am willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice's offer is getting progressively worse for me. This suggests she might be aiming to stall until the decreasing value forces me to accept a bad deal.
* **Leverage Shift:** While the decreasing value hurts me more, it also increases the pressure on Alice to secure a deal.  She's losing value too. 
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get Alice closer to a 50/50 split.  My offer in the next round needs to reflect the urgency of the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most time-efficient solution. Let's close this deal now before we both lose out more.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** This offer represents my bottom line.  Going any lower would be a significant loss, even considering the inflation. 
* **Appeal to Logic:** By emphasizing fairness and the urgency of the situation, I'm aiming to make Alice see the rationality of accepting the deal now.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While there's always a risk Alice will reject this and leave me with a worse offer in the next round, the potential loss from accepting a bad deal now outweighs the potential gain from further negotiation."
