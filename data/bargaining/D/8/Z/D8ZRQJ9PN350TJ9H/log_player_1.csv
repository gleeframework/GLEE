"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

This is a generous offer, considering the initial amount of $10,000. I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $6,000 in this round is equivalent to $5,400 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
