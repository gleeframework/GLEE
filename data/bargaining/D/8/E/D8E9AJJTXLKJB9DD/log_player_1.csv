"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000.  This is a good starting point as it leaves a significant amount of money for both of us, and gives Bob a small incentive to potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money.  Rejecting it risks losing everything as the game progresses."
