"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a pretty generous offer considering I'm the one making the first move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation factor. It's my turn to make a proposal!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, hoping to get a better deal before the next round of inflation hits!"

Considering the significant drop in the value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. However, I still want to aim for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 55-45 split, especially considering the severe inflation hit. It's my turn to make a proposal again!"

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because I think the 52.5-47.5 split is a reasonable deal, given the severe inflation hit. I'd rather take this deal now than risk waiting for the next round and potentially getting an even worse offer."
