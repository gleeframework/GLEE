"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. This gives you a significant sum upfront. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's be reasonable -  this offer still leaves you with a significant amount.""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:**  Alice's opening offer was heavily skewed in her favor.  A strong counter-offer demonstrates that I won't accept an unfair deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  Every round, the value decreases more for me than for Alice. I need to apply pressure to settle quickly. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer is still negotiable. If Alice rejects it, there's room to come down slightly in a future round, if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this deal is getting worse for both of us with each round. I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be more balanced. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  Another rejection means a potential loss of even more value.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Her message implies this is her final offer, suggesting she won't budge further.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** While not ideal, 400,000 is significantly better than the initial offer and still a substantial sum. Holding out for more risks getting even less in a later round."
