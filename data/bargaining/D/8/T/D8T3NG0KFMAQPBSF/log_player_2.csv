"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 52.5/47.5. It's a fair split given the inflation, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 475000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to take a smaller share this round, but I still need more than 30%. I'm offering a 60/40 split. It's our last chance to reach an agreement before the value of the money drops even further. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting down to the wire. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's 60/40 offer guarantees me $400,000. If I reject this, there's a high chance I'll end up with even less in the next round due to the decreasing value for Alice. It's time to cut my losses and secure a reasonable payout."
