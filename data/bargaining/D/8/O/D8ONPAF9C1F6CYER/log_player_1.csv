"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob will get 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better.  Let's split it 60-40, in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll actually get 0.95 x $400,000 = $380,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the original $1,000,000, which is $550,000, and Bob will get 45%, which is $450,000."
