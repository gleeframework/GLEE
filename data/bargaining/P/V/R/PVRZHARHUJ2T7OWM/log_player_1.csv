"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while also considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve a bit more since the money is worth less each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
