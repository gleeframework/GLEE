"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share as I was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less due to inflation, I'm not as concerned about getting a smaller share. However, I still think I deserve a bit more than 45%. I'll accept this offer.
