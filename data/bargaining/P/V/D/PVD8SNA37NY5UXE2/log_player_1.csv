Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 90:10 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I have the power to make a counter-proposal. 
# Alice gain: 10
