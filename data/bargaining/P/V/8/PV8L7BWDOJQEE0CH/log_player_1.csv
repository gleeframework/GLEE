"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I'm going to start with a high offer for myself, knowing the money will be worth less each round. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take half now than risk getting nothing in the end.  The inflation will continue to eat away at my share, so accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
