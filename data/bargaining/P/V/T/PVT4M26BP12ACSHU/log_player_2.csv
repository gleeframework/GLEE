"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split close to 50/50, but accounting for the fact that the money loses value over time. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair, it's better to see if I can get a slightly better deal in the next round. The money loses value for me each round, but I can use that to my advantage by negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the fairness of your last offer, Alice.  Since the money is losing value, let's split it evenly this round to ensure we both get the most out of it.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but a 50/50 split isn't fair considering the inflation. I'm willing to compromise slightly from my original offer. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd like to get a bit more, the money is losing value quickly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I receive a significant amount."
