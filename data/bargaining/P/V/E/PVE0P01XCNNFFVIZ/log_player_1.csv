I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I'm the one making the offer, I'll take the larger share.  However, I'm starting with a generous offer to encourage Bob to accept. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer. Even though the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept a 10/90 split. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm proposing an 80/20 split in my favor.  Since I'm the one making the offer, I'm taking the larger share again.  However, I'm reducing my share from the first round, hoping to find a compromise with Bob.  Let's see if this is a better offer for him."
