"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While the offer seems worse than my previous one, inflation has significantly reduced the value of money for Alice. 
* **Strategic Advantage:** By accepting, I ensure I get some money, and Alice has to accept this offer to avoid losing even more due to further inflation. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Rejecting could lead to a worse offer from Alice in the next round, where the value of the money would decrease even further for both of us."
