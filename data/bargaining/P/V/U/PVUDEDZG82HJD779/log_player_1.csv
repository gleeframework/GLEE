I'll start by offering Bob a very small portion of the money, hoping he'll accept it quickly.  Let's see if he's greedy or cautious!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'm not going to accept this offer, especially since the money is worth the same to me as last round. I'll try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time. I'll offer Bob a significant portion of the money, but still a much smaller share than I'll keep.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not afraid to hold onto a large portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being very greedy, even though his offer is worth significantly less to him due to inflation. I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm going to try a 50/50 split. Bob's share is worth a lot less to him due to the inflation, and I'm hoping this will convince him to accept. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a decent amount of money."
