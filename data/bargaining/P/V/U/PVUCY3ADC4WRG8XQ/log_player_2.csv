I'm going to try to get a better deal.  I'm sure Alice will see the value of getting some money now, even if it's less than what she might get later."

Alice is getting greedy! I know I'm losing value with each round, but I'm not going to accept anything less than what I offered her in the last round. Let's see what she does next."

I'm still losing a lot of value due to inflation, but I'm not going to accept anything less than what I offered her before.  I'm hoping Alice will realize she needs to compromise.  Let's see what she proposes next."

{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm losing a lot of money with each round, and it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting.  Even though this is a little less than I offered her in the last round, it's a better deal than I would get if we kept rejecting each other.  I'm taking it."
