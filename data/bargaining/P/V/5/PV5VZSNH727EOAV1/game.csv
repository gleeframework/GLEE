6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000.  The value decreases rapidly each round, so it's in our best interest to settle quickly.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I think we can be even more efficient. Let's switch the roles, and I'll take $6000 this time. This will save us another round, and we'll both get a better deal due to the decreasing value.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. You're losing value much faster than I am. This offer is still generous considering the time pressure.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,We're both losing value with each passing round. Let's agree on an even split to maximize our gains. This is the best solution for both of us.,Bob,4,
