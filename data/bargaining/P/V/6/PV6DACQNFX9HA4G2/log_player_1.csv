Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, given the inflation we need to consider. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting because it gives me a decent starting amount, and waiting longer significantly devalues the money. However, his offer is heavily skewed in his favor. 

Let's analyze:

* **My initial offer:** I get $6000, he gets $4000. 
* **Bob's offer:** I get $4000, he gets $6000.

While the difference seems the same, the inflation makes it worse for me if I keep rejecting. 

Here's my decision:

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm willing to gamble a bit more. While Bob's offer isn't terrible in the short term, the inflation will hurt me more in the long run if we keep going back and forth with similar offers.  I need to push for a more balanced deal."
