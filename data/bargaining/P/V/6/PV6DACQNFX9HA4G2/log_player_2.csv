"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems reasonable now, the inflation will mean I'll get a much worse deal in the long run. Let's see if I can get a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, given the inflation we need to consider. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer is heavily skewed by the inflation. This is a fairer split that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. This offer is decent, and I'm willing to accept it."
