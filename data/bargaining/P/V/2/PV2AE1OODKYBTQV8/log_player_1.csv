"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose an even split of $50 for each of us.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the $40 now, as the money will be worth less in the next round!"
