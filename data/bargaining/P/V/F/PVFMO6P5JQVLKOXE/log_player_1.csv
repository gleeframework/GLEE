"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is a risky move, as Bob is getting a very small share.  However, it's a strong opening offer to see if Bob is willing to accept a less-than-ideal split to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better for him than the previous round, and while it's still a decent amount for me, the inflation factor is starting to take a toll.  I'm not willing to settle for this yet, and I'm hoping to get a better split in the next round.  I'll need to be careful to keep my own needs in mind while also acknowledging the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try to bridge the gap between our previous offers.  This offer gives Bob a better share than my initial proposal, but it's still more than what he's offered me.  I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to convince him to accept, as the inflation is continuing to hurt us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still hesitant.  The inflation is really hitting hard now, but I'm determined to hold out for a better deal.  I'm still hoping for a larger share, and I believe I can negotiate a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a risky move, as Bob's offer in the previous round was closer to 50/50. However, I'm pushing for a better split for myself. I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm hoping that Bob will prioritize getting a deal done over getting a slightly better split.  We're running out of rounds, so I need to start taking some risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is now very favorable to him, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.  However, I'm still not willing to accept this. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal.  The inflation is hurting us both, but I believe I can still get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a 50/50 split.  The inflation is getting increasingly serious, and I'm worried about the possibility of both of us getting nothing.  This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that it's in our best interests to accept this and get something rather than risk losing everything."
