Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to meet you halfway, Bob. Don't let the money lose more value! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to frame her offer as a compromise, time is really working in Bob's favor. Alice's losses are accelerating much faster than Bob's due to the higher inflation rate she faces.  It's still worthwhile for Bob to hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it before the money is worth even less.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could continue to push for a larger share, offering a 50/50 split at this stage has several advantages:

* **Simplicity and Fairness:** It's a clean and easy split, avoiding further complex negotiations.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the time pressure and the accelerating devaluation of the money.
* **Potential for Acceptance:**  Alice might be more willing to accept a seemingly ""fair"" deal than risk losing even more value with further rejections."
