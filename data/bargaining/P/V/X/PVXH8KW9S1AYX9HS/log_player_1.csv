"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this case, the 40 dollars I would gain is equivalent to 54 dollars in the first round.

Considering the offer, I think I'll accept Bob's proposal. I'll take the 40 dollars and Bob will take the 60 dollars.
