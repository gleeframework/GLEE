"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn - let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince Bob is offering an even split of $50 each, I see no reason to reject this fair offer. Accepting this will ensure we both get an equal share without the need for further negotiations."
