Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but we need to account for the inflation impacting us both, especially you. This offer is a good starting point, and we can work from there. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
