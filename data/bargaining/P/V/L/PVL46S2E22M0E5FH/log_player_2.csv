"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in your best interest if we want to avoid inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to potentially get a better deal."

Round 2

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear inflation hurts you more than me. This is my final offer, take it before it shrinks further! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll take the risk of another round, as the current offer still doesn't seem fair, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal despite the increasing impact of inflation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to offset the losses from inflation. This is as low as I'm willing to go.""}"
