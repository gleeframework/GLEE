"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* Alice gain: 63
* Bob gain: 50

I think this is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
