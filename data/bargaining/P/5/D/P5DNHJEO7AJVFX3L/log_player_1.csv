"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, $6,000 is actually a pretty good deal. But I'm not sure if I should trust Bob's ""take it or leave it"" attitude.

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a bit more, but not too much, since I don't know how much Bob values the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me this time. Hope you'll accept!""

# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my offer! $6,500 is actually a decent deal, considering the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. But I'm not sure if I should give in now, especially since Bob seems to be playing a bit hard to get.

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better.
