"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection in this round.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 95% of the original $5000, which is $4,750. Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 90% of the original $6,667 (since the original amount for Bob was $5,000 + $1,667), which is $5,400.

Considering the inflation effect, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I'd rather not accept a 60/40 split, especially since I'm losing some value due to inflation. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better share""
}
```

I'm offering a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, considering the inflation effect. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
