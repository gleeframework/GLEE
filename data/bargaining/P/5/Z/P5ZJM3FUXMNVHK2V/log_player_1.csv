"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a split of $9000 for me and $1000 for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small share to consider accepting while still leaving the majority for me.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the 20% inflation makes this offer a decent deal. It's better to get $5000 now than risk getting nothing at all in future rounds."
