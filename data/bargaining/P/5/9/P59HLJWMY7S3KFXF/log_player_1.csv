I'm going to propose a very lopsided offer in the first round.  I figure Bob might not realize how much the value will decrease over time, and might accept just to avoid being the one to propose next.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the value of the money is going down rapidly.  It's better to take this even split than risk getting nothing in the end."
