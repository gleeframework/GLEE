"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share, and we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a moderate split. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 90% of the original amount, so I'd get $9,000 in this round.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, as I'd get $6,000, which is less than my original offer. However, I don't want to reject it without considering it further.
