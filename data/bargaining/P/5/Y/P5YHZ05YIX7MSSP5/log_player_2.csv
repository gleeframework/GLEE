Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn and the clock is ticking.  I'll take a little less this round, but we need to settle this soon. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 50/50, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Inflation is eating away at the value of the money rapidly. With each round, Bob loses an additional 10% of the potential value. Waiting any longer significantly reduces the value of any potential gains, even if he could secure a slightly better split. 
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is aware of the inflation as well, even if her losses are higher.  Her willingness to accept a 50/50 split suggests she's unlikely to offer anything significantly better in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk of Failure:** If Bob continues to reject offers, there's a real chance they will run out of rounds and both receive nothing. Accepting a guaranteed 50% now eliminates that risk."
