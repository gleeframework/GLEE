"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  This is a fair initial offer, considering the inflation will affect me more than Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob. This is a compromise from my initial offer, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal, considering the inflation, I'll accept. Any further rounds will leave me with less money due to inflation, and I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob."
