"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. This accounts for the time value of money. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer, even though it's ""fair"" right now, I know I can get a better deal by waiting. The time value of money works in my favor, and Alice's offer doesn't fully account for that. Let's see what she proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's flip the script this time, Alice. My offer accounts for the fact that the money is worth less to you in the next round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to compromise, but this offer recognizes the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is more favorable to me than my previous offer, and I know that if I reject, she might not make another concession in the next round. I'm willing to accept this compromise and split the money."
