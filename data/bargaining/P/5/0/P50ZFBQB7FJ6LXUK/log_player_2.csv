Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While time is ticking, accepting an offer where I get significantly less than half is a bad strategy.  I need to show firmness to make her budge."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"":  ""This is my last compromise. The clock is ticking for both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but making it clear this is my bottom line.  The message emphasizes the shared risk of running out of time.  Alice needs to realize that pushing for a much larger share means we both lose."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, don't be stubborn 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me! While this offer isn't ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject.  Getting something is better than nothing, and at this rate, I'm on track to get nothing if I keep rejecting. Alice is playing hardball, but I need to prioritize what little value I have left."
