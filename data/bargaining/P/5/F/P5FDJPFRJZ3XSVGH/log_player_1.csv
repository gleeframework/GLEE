"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Take 10% and I'll take the rest. It's a fair start to our negotiation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 100,000$ and keeping the remaining 900,000$ for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point.  We can adjust from there, but I'm confident we can reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not comfortable with a 40% gain for myself, especially since the money is already decreasing in value with each round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob, but I'm looking for a better deal. I think I can do better than 40%.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in Round 2, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Take 30% and I'll take the rest. Let's move forward from here.""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference. A 45/55 split feels fair, considering we both had to compromise in previous rounds. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to be even more cautious with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. A 45/55 split is still not in my favor, and I'm not willing to accept a smaller share of the decreasing pie.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob, but I'm not comfortable with a 55% gain for you. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Take 40% and I'll take 60%. Let's find a deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us, but I'm still holding out for a better share for myself."
