"Round 1

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you wanting to be fair, but I need a bit more to make it worth it for me. How about this?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more than fair deal 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, let's split it evenly.  It's important to reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Splitting evenly doesn't account for the decreasing value on your end, this is a better compromise 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  We need to push for a more significant shift in the next round as time is running out and the value for me is rapidly decreasing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. This offer recognizes the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time pressure affects you more, considering the inflation. This is a fair adjustment 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is using the time pressure and inflation against me, but her offer is still not reflective of the rapidly decreasing value I'm facing. It's risky, but I need to hold out for a much better deal to offset the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. We are running out of time, and this is the only way I can justify accepting a deal at this point.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a high-stakes gamble. By taking a firm stance and presenting it as a final offer, we're hoping to pressure Alice into accepting. This offer reflects the urgency of the situation and the significant impact of inflation on the value of my potential gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you one more chance to accept a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  With only three rounds left, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. While this offer is far from ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. Rejecting it carries the huge risk of walking away with nothing if Alice doesn't offer anything better in the remaining rounds."
