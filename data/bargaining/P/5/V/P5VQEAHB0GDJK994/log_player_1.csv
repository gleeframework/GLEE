"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'll think for a moment...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer. The 400,000 I'd get in this round is equivalent to 382,353 in the first round, which is a decent amount.

However, I'm not sure if I want to settle for that, especially since Bob is keeping 600,000, which is equivalent to 600,000 in the first round. I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 400k is enough for me. I'll make a counter-offer.""
}
```

Now it's my turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 150,000 from Bob's previous offer, but still keeping a slight edge. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less, the 480,000 I'd get in this round is equivalent to only 414,181 in the first round. That's a tough pill to swallow.

However, considering the offer from Bob, I think I can do better than that. I'm not sure why Bob is still offering me 480,000, considering the previous offers.

I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 480k is enough for me. I'll make a counter-offer.""
}
```

Time to think of a new strategy!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if we can finally agree on something.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving some room for compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
