**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is running out. We're over halfway through the rounds, and the longer this goes on, the less money we both get. I'm betting Alice will become more amenable to a fairer deal as the rounds progress and the potential losses from inflation become more significant."
