# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not happy with getting only 10% of the total amount. I think I can get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's try 55-45. This is still a good deal for both of us, especially given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice's offer is better than the first one, I still think I can negotiate for a larger share. The inflation hasn't affected my gains yet, so I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I see we're getting closer. Considering the inflation is affecting your share, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still offer you a significant amount. Let's settle on 58-42.""}"
