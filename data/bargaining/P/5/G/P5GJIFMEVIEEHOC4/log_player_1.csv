"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. This is a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it closer to 50/50. I'm willing to give you a slight advantage this time. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $49 is now worth 95% of what it would have been in the first round.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
