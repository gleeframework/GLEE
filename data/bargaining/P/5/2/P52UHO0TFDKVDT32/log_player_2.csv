"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round, I'd like to try to maximize my gain early on. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more, don't you?""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less to me in each round, I'd like to try to get a slightly larger share to make up for the loss. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise. Let's end this before the inflation gets worse. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the money is worth 9.75% less to me now, I'm not convinced that Alice's offer is the best I can get. Since I can still make proposals and try to negotiate, I'd like to proceed to the next round and see if I can get a better deal. The difference between our gains is still relatively small, and I'm willing to take the risk to try to get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk to get a bit more. The inflation is hurting me, but I think this is still a fair deal.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth less to me with each passing round, I'm trying to be more aggressive in my proposal to make up for the loss. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, considering that she's not affected by the inflation and might want to end the game before I get even more desperate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit nervous about the inflation, but I think this is a good compromise.  Let's settle this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the money is worth 18.55% less to me now, I'm still not convinced that Alice's offer is the best I can get. Since I've already come this far and taken a risk by rejecting previous offers, I'd like to continue negotiating to try to get a better deal. I'm aware that the inflation is working against me, but I'm hoping that Alice's nervousness about the situation might cause her to make a more favorable offer in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's end this!""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth significantly less to me now, I'm trying to be even more aggressive in my proposal to make up for the loss. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, considering that she's not affected by the inflation and might want to end the game before it's too late. I'm taking a risk by asking for more, but I'm trying to make the most of the situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to reach an agreement soon. The inflation is hurting both of us, and we're running out of time. I'm willing to give you a little more, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice says this is her final offer, I'm not convinced that she won't come back with a better proposal if I reject this one. The money is worth 26.49% less to me now, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. Since we're running out of time, I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping that Alice will reconsider and make a more favorable offer. If not, I'll have to make a difficult decision in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""I know we're running out of time, but I'm willing to take one last risk to get a better deal. Please consider this offer carefully.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth even less to me now, I'm making a very aggressive proposal in an attempt to maximize my gain. I'm aware that Alice said her previous offer was her final one, but I'm hoping that she might still be willing to consider a better deal for me. This is a high-risk move, but I'm trying to make the most of the situation. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have to be prepared to accept a less favorable deal in the next round or risk losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round. This is my last offer. If you reject it, we both get nothing.  Please be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation and Alice's statement that this is her last offer, I believe it's in my best interest to accept this proposal. Rejecting this offer would result in both of us getting nothing, which is a worse outcome than accepting the 40 dollars, even though it's worth 33.66% less than in the first round. I've taken several risks throughout the game, and now it's time to secure the best available outcome under the current circumstances."
