"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm making the first offer. This is a good deal for you considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal before the value drops further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is your last chance for a good deal. The value keeps dropping for you.  Take this offer before it gets any worse! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer as well. Although the value of the money is decreasing for me, I think I can still try to negotiate a slightly better deal. Since Alice seems eager to settle, I'll try to use that to my advantage in the next round. Let's proceed! {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
