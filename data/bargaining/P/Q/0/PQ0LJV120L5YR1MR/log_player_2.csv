Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer or we'll both end up with nothing! 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer a larger share, the inflation is rapidly diminishing the value of the money. It's better to take this offer and secure some gain than risk losing everything."
