"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $400,000 and Bob will take $600,000. I'll be happy to end the game here and avoid further inflation."
