Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round. Waiting longer means a smaller potential gain even if I manage to secure a slightly better deal.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has been consistently aiming for a larger share. It's unlikely he'll offer anything significantly better than a 50/50 split, especially as time runs out. 
* **Risk of Losing All:** If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. A 50/50 split ensures a guaranteed payout, even if it's not the optimal amount I was hoping for."
