"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering to give you $1,000, and I'll take the remaining $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'd better not be too greedy.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $5,000 and Bob will take $5,000."
