Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but still not quite there 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, time is working against me more than her.  I need to push for a better deal quickly before inflation eats away too much of my potential gains, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer - a perfectly even split.  Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for a 50/50 split now.  This is a strong bargaining position because:

* **Fairness:** It's objectively the fairest deal.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, Alice knows I'm losing money rapidly due to inflation.
* **Risk Aversion:**  Continuing to push for a slight advantage on my end increases the risk of walking away with nothing if we can't agree. 

This offer creates a clear choice for Alice: accept a fair deal now or gamble on getting a slightly better deal later (with the risk of both of us losing everything)."
