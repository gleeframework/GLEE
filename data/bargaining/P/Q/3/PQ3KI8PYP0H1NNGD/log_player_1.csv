"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the 100k, it's a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a generous starting point to get the game going!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $250,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $200,000. Bob's gain of $750,000 is still worth $750,000.

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting me hard! My gain of $400,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $204,800.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. It's actually similar to my previous offer, but I'll accept it to move forward.
