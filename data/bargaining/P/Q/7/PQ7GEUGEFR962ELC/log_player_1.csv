"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but it's still a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a bigger share, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too aggressive, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more in my favor. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle.""}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept a slightly more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my share! I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since my money is worth 14.26% less, I'll need to be more cautious.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too aggressive again, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more in my favor. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go back to a 50/50 split, but I think it's the fairest way to divide the money. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle... again.""}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept a more balanced split this time around."
