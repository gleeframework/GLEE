I propose that I take $9,000 and Bob takes $1,000.  I figure this is a fair starting point, and I am hoping to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering more than Bob. Since the money is losing value, I want to end the game quickly while ensuring I get a larger portion of the pie."
