"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. It's a fair share, and I'm hoping you'll accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* My gain: $7,000 / 0.9 = $7,778.78 (10% less due to inflation)
* Bob's gain: $3,000 / 0.95 = $3,157.89 (5% less due to inflation)

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I was hoping for a better deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if you'll accept this time!"
