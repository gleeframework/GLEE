450000.0,550000.0,Your 60/40 split seems unfair given the inflation rate.  I propose a 55/45 split which is more balanced considering the risks.,Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against you, and this back-and-forth isn't helping either of us. I propose a 50/50 split â€“ it's fair, simple, and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum.",Bob,4,
