"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's start with a balanced split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to the initial proposal 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I was hoping for a slightly better split, and 55-45 is not as attractive as my initial proposal of 60-40. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to your offer, but still a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 58-42 split, which is a bit closer to my initial offer, but still a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and try to find a mutually beneficial agreement 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. After considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I think a 50-50 split is a fair compromise. It's a neutral proposal that doesn't favor either of us, and I'm willing to settle for it."
