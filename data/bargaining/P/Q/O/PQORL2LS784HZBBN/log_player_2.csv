"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what I can get!  I'll counter with a more favorable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation we need to keep in mind. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, given the inflation we're experiencing. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is fair, and with the inflation, I'm not sure I can get much better.  Let's call it a day!"
