"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and take inflation into account.""}\n\nI'm offering a slightly higher share to myself to account for the lower inflation rate I'm experiencing, while still being relatively fair to Bob. The message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the shared concern about the devaluing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I understand the impact of inflation, but your previous offer wasn't quite equitable. Let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 45 dollars in the second round is even less valuable than it would have been in the first round. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'm effectively getting less than I would have if I had accepted a similar offer in round one. Given that Bob is experiencing a higher rate of inflation, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us both, but I'm willing to make a deal that reflects our shared loss. This is my best offer considering the circumstances.""}\n\nGiven that the money is devaluing, I'm increasing my share to account for the decreased value and the fact that Bob's money is worth 10% less in this round. By emphasizing that we're both losing value, I'm trying to convey that this offer is reasonable and takes into account the impact of inflation on both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise, given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're losing money with every round.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant devaluation of the money for both of us, especially for Bob, I believe accepting the 50/50 split at this point is the best decision. The offer is fair in the sense that it splits the remaining value evenly, and considering the increasing loss of value with each round, it's reasonable to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. The fact that Bob is experiencing a higher rate of inflation also means that his half is worth less to him than my half is to me, making this a relatively advantageous deal for me at this stage."
