"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you half of the money, and we can go from there.""
}
```

This offer is a straightforward 50/50 split, giving us both an equal amount of money. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but you'll still get a decent chunk. Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to keep a slightly larger share, but I'm not too far off from the original 50/50 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to aim for a slightly higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more than 40%. This is a fair split, and I'm willing to move forward with it.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly higher share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount of money. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise. You'll still get a decent amount, and I'll get a bigger chunk. Let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to get a larger share, and I'm not too happy about the 30/70 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better. A 30/70 split is too lopsided, and I'd like to try to get a more balanced share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. This is a fair split, and I think we can both be happy with it.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
