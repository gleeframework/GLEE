Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting point is a bit off.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. This reflects the fact that I'm hit harder by inflation in this scenario.  Think carefully, time is money, literally! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
