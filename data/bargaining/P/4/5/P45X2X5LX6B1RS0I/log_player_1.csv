"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slight advantage this round, but let's see if we can find a more sustainable split later. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a slight advantage, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal. Maybe he'll be more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still not giving up my advantage""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than he initially offered me, but still trying to maintain a slight edge for myself. Let's see if he's willing to compromise again."
