"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but we can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next rounds. The current offer is too skewed in Alice's favor, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and get a more equitable division of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle with a 60-40 split. This way, we both get a significant share, and we can avoid further rounds that would decrease the value for you.""}"
