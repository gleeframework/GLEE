"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a split of $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for Bob, with the message ""Let's split fairly"". This split gives me a slight advantage, but it's still a relatively fair division. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable offer and accept it, ending the game quickly before the money loses value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. This considers the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIn this round, Bob has proposed a split where I would gain $475,000 and he would gain $525,000. Considering the inflation, the actual value of the money has decreased by 5%, but the split itself seems slightly less in my favor compared to my initial offer. However, given the decrease in value due to inflation, and to avoid further devaluation, I will accept this offer to secure my gain.
