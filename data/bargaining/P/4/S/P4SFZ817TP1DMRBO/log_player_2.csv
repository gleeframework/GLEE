"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation penalty for me is a consideration, but I think I can get a better deal than 10% of the total amount. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. I think 40% for me is a fair deal, considering the inflation penalty I'll face if we keep negotiating.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made a counteroffer that takes into account the 5% inflation penalty I'll face if we continue negotiating. By offering 40% for myself, I'm trying to find a middle ground that Alice might find acceptable. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  I'm sticking to my principles, but I'm giving you a chance to get this done before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Alice's offer again. Although the inflation penalty is increasing, I still think I can get a better deal than 25% of the total amount. Alice's offer is still quite far from my previous counteroffer, so I'll wait for the next round to see if she's willing to compromise further. The fact that she's ""sticking to her principles"" suggests that she might be willing to negotiate further, so I'll take the risk of another round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 375000, ""alice_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than 25%. Considering the increasing inflation penalty, I think 37.5% for me is a reasonable offer. Let's settle this before it's too late!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've made another counteroffer that takes into account the increasing inflation penalty. By offering 37.5% for myself, I'm trying to find a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. I'm hoping that Alice will see the sense in settling the deal now, rather than risking further negotiations that could lead to an even worse outcome for both of us."
