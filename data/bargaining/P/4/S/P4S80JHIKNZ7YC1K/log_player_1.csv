Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer is tempting, Alice, but I'm feeling a bit bolder. How about we go 55/45 in my favor?  We can still avoid too much inflation this way. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
