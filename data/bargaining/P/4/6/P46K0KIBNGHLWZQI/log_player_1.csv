"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a slightly bigger share this round. 
# Alice gain: 9000 
# Bob gain: 1000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
