"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer, considering we both get to keep a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential earnings.

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the decreased value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'm not as keen on this offer as I was on the first one. However, it's still a decent proposal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to prioritize my own earnings due to inflation.""
}
```"
