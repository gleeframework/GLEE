"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but of course, I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split it 60/40 in my favor. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400,000 * 0.9 = 360,000
* Bob gain: 600,000 * 0.9 = 540,000

I'm not thrilled with the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to accept it to move on to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
