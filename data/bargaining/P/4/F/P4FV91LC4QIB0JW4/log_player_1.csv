Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. He knows the value of the money is decreasing for me, so he's trying to push for a worse deal with each round. I need to hold out for a better offer."
