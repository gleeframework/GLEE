"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for us to both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
This split is heavily in Alice's favor. I know the value of the money decreases quickly for her, so I'm willing to gamble that she'll offer a better deal in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but 60/40 is too much.  How about we flip it and see how you feel?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. 55/45 seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still trying to take a larger share, even with the decreasing value.  I'll hold out for a bit longer and see if she gets more desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  I'll take the same split you offered last round, but now it's in my favor.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob. I'm taking a hit from inflation, and you're just stalling.  52/48 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is clearly getting anxious, and while this isn't the 55/45 I held out for, it's still a better deal than her initial offer, and better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
