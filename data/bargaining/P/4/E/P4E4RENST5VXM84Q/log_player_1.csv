"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Since Bob has no inflation to worry about, I'm going to offer him a tiny amount and keep the vast majority for myself.  It's a long shot, but maybe he'll accept it just to get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it would be nice to get more, the inflation means each round I wait I lose 20% of the value of the money I get. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee I get at least something."
