"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money as time goes on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's proposal is tempting, I believe we can get a better deal for ourselves. There are 12 rounds, and we both lose value with each passing round.  I'm going to try and get a more equitable split.  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference a bit.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to get this done before the inflation really kicks in.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more than it hurts you. I'm willing to negotiate, but my offer needs to reflect the reality of the situation. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her initial proposal, I still think we can do better.  I understand the inflation is hitting her harder, but we both need to reach a compromise where we are comfortable.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  We both lose money with every round.  I'm willing to split it evenly.  This gives us both a good deal and avoids further losses. What do you say?""}
