"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial 100$, which is $80, and Bob gets 20% of the initial 100$, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decision. Considering that Bob's offer is very skewed towards him, I'll reject it. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer should be more aggressive to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This way, we split the remaining value of the money as evenly as possible, considering the inflation."
