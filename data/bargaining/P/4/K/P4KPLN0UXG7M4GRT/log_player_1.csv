This offer gives me the majority of the money, but leaves Bob with a small amount to potentially incentivize him to accept.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm going to reject it for now. I know the money is worth less each round, but I'm hoping I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round. I'm also not sure how the inflation is affecting Bob, so I might be able to use that to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a significant share.  I'm hoping this is a more reasonable offer that he'll accept, especially given the inflation that's occurring."
