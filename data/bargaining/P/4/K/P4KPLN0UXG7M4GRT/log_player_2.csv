I want to see if I can get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Alice is willing to take a smaller share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Although I'm getting less than I originally proposed, I'm getting a decent amount, and the value of the money is decreasing with each round.  It's better to take what I can now."
