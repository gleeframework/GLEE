"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""That's a very unfair offer, Alice.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's be reasonable - we both lose if this drags on.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. I'll take 55, and you can have 45.  We're both losing money with each round, and this is getting closer to fair. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, time is working against me more than it is against her.  I need to push for a better split quickly, or the effects of inflation will make even an even split unattractive."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. I'm taking a hit with inflation here, this is more than fair at this point.  Take the deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want more, Bob, but this is the best I can do considering the inflation. We're both losing out, and if we keep going we'll both get nothing. Let's be reasonable and split it 45/55. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tide has turned. While not ideal, accepting a 55/45 split in my favor is the best I can hope for at this stage. The longer the game goes on, the more the relative value of the money shifts in Alice's favor. It's better to take a decent share now than risk getting a worse deal, or even nothing at all, later."
