Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Inflation:** While the inflation is significant, it's in Alice's favor. This means she's likely to be more aggressive in her offers as the game goes on.
* **Alice's Offer:** This offer gives Bob $200,000. Although the actual value is less due to inflation, it's still a considerable amount.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means going to round 4 where Bob will have to make an offer, and the inflation will continue to hurt him.  It's a gamble that might pay off, but it's also risky.

**Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, considering the inflation and the possibility of getting even less in the next round.**"
