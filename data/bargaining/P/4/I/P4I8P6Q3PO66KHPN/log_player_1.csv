Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor. I'm betting that Bob will be tempted to take the small amount now, rather than risk getting nothing at all if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair, and I'm not willing to accept such a small amount.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time. I believe that with the inflation factor kicking in, Bob will be more inclined to accept a deal that gives him a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. I'm not going to settle for such a small share, especially as inflation is making the money less valuable with each round. I believe I can secure a better deal if I continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. With inflation steadily increasing, I think Bob will be more willing to accept a fair deal rather than risk getting nothing at all."
