"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. This way, we can end the game quickly and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money equally. We can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the risk of inflation. Consider this a reasonable offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm trying to balance the risk of inflation with the desire to get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation risk. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the value of the money!

I'll consider Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think the 5500:4500 split is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation risk. It's better than risking even less in the next round."
