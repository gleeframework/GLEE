"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly, giving each of us $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but you'll still get a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself, but I'm not sure I'm willing to give him the upper hand. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I deserve a fairer share, considering I'm the one making the second proposal. I'll wait for his next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of making the first two proposals.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to $5,500, while giving Bob a slightly smaller share of $4,500. Let's see if he'll accept this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for being flexible and willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more and more skewed towards his favor! I'm not comfortable with giving him a 7:3 ratio. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's unfair and doesn't reflect the original equal split we started with. I'll keep pushing for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm not going to give in to Bob's aggressive offers yet! Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for being patient and holding out for a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a $4,000 share while keeping a $6,000 share for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this compromise!"
