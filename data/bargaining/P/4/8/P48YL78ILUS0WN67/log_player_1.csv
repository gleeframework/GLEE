"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. Let's end this quickly and avoid any inflation issues. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, $500,000 is equivalent to $400,000 in the first round. And since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'd be giving up $400,000.

Considering the inflation effect, I think I'd be better off accepting this offer and getting $400,000 now rather than risking further inflation and potentially getting less.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
