"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI am offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept this division as a fair one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This is a slightly better split for me, considering the devaluation. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 4737 
# Bob gain: 5263 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, even considering the 5% decrease in value due to inflation. The current offer gives Bob a significantly larger share, and I'm not convinced that the slight adjustment for inflation justifies accepting this division. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5225, ""bob_gain"": 4775, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a reasonable compromise.""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to give myself a slightly larger share than in the first round, but still attempted to present it as a compromise, taking into account the devaluation of the money due to inflation. I aim to make the offer appealing enough for Bob to accept, while maximizing my gain."
