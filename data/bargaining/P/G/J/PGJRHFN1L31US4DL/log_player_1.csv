```
{

# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final, take-it-or-leave-it offer! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only $15. With only one round left, I should have tried harder to negotiate a better deal earlier. Since we've reached the final round and I've rejected the last offer, I suppose we'll both end up with nothing."
