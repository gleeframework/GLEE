Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a fairer split than your initial offer. It's better than the 50/50 split I'd get if we waited for the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
