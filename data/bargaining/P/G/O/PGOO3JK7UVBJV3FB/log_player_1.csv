"Round 1

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000$ to 100,000$ split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, considering the inflation will impact me more than Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000} 
```

I'll offer 810,000 for myself and 190,000 for Bob.  I still need to account for inflation, but I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid further rounds and the possibility of even worse deals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm offering 729,000 for myself and 271,000 for Bob.  Inflation is biting hard now, but I'm hoping that by offering a decent chunk to Bob, he'll finally agree to split the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 271000 
# Bob gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is hurting me too much. I'd rather accept this offer and get something than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
