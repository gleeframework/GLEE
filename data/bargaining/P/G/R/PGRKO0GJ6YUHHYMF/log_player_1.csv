"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity in the first round, Alice.  However, I believe a 75-25 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation affecting the value of the money in future rounds. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
