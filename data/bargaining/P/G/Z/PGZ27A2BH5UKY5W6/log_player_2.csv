Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you, I'll make a slightly better offer, but still in my favor

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  The inflation is eating into my potential gains, and this offer prevents further losses for both of us.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hurting you, but I'm not willing to do a 50/50 split. This is my most generous offer yet 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential gains. Accepting Alice's offer of $4,300 is better than risking another round where:

*  The money will be worth even less.
*  Alice might offer even less favorable terms, pushing Bob closer to accepting a deal where he gets less than $4,000.

While not ideal, taking the $4,300 cuts losses and guarantees Bob some profit."
