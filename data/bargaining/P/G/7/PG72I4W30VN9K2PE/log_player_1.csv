Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 55/45 in my favor, but considering the inflation, I think it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
