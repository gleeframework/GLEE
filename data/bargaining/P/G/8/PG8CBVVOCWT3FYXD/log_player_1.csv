"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid any potential inflation that might happen in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more than 50%, I'm not sure how the inflation will affect future rounds.  Accepting this offer guarantees me at least half the money, and I don't want to risk getting less in the next round."
