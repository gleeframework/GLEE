Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly.""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept this as a fair division."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his claim of generosity, the split is significantly in his favor, and considering the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I'll adjust my offer slightly to make it more appealing to Bob while still being advantageous to me. Given that the money is worth less to both of us now, but more significantly less to Bob, I'll offer a split that reflects the urgency of closing the deal but still recognizes the decreasing value for both parties.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting Bob's offer because, given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, especially for Bob, his offer is relatively fair at this point. The difference in the split is not as significant when considering the real value we're both getting compared to the initial rounds. It's better to accept this offer than to risk another round where the value could decrease even further.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###"
