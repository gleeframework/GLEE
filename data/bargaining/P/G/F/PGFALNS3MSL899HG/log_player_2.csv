# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 4000/6000 split seems fair, it's worth remembering that the money is worth less to me with each passing round. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."

# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
