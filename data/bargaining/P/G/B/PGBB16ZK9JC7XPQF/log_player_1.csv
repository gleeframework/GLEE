"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a generous offer, giving me $600,000 and leaving Bob with $400,000. Will Bob accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","A tough decision!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. The money is worth 10% less now, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for negotiation. Will Bob accept this offer?"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

  ""bob_gain"": 475000
}
```
