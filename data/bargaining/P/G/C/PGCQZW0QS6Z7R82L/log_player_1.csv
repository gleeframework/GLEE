"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and simple starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is heavily biased towards him, I'll have to consider the potential consequences of rejecting it. If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round, and I might end up with even less.

However, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, and I need to take that into account. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000
}
```

This offer is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but I'm still willing to compromise to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! 

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to be cautious and think carefully about this offer. While Bob's offer is still heavily biased towards him, I'm not sure if I can afford to reject it and risk losing even more value in the next round.

However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now, and I need to be strategic. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm trying to take into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money and the fact that Bob has been making offers that are heavily biased towards himself. I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now! 

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'm starting to get desperate. Bob's offer is still heavily biased towards him, but I'm not sure if I can afford to reject it and risk losing even more value in the next round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point.
