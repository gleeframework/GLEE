Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping Bob will see the value in a compromise."

With each round, the value of my potential gains is significantly decreasing.  While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the current circumstances."
