"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'll go down a little.  Let's split it 80/20, and I'll take the bigger slice this time.  Come on, let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hitting her much harder than it's hitting me. I need to hold out for a better offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but we're still not close. 60/40 is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly, especially for Alice. I need to apply more pressure.
* **Firm but Fair:**  My offer is a significant move from my previous proposal but maintains a reasonable split.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary. 
* **Finality:** By stating ""final offer,"" I increase the pressure on Alice to accept.  She knows I'm serious and that further haggling might lead to me walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to 70/30, but this is my final offer.  Let's not waste any more time. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky one. Alice is offering the split I wanted earlier, but the inflation has significantly eroded the value of her share. However, this is also my final offer, and accepting would still net me a significant sum that's decreasing in value every round. 

I'll take the risk and reject it. I'm betting that Alice is feeling the pressure of the decreasing money and will be forced to offer a larger share in the next round to avoid walking away with nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. This is my final offer. Let's end this now and both walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:**  Alice is clearly feeling the heat of the inflation, and my rejection of her ""final"" offer demonstrates my resolve.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm slightly increasing my previous offer to 65/35. This shows a willingness to compromise, but only marginally. 
* **Finality:**  I'm reiterating that this is my absolute final offer.  This leaves the ball in Alice's court and forces a decision. Delaying further significantly hurts her more than me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm dropping down to 60/40. This is my final offer. If we don't agree, we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut my losses. While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice has met my previous offer, and the relentless inflation means waiting longer will only result in a smaller amount for both of us. Accepting now guarantees me a decent sum, whereas continuing the game risks ending up with nothing."
