"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I propose to take $99 and leave Bob with $1.  This is a very aggressive starting offer, but I want to see how quickly Bob will try to negotiate!  Since we have 12 rounds, even if he rejects this, I can still make substantial gains in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to take more, Bob's offer is a fair compromise. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out for a better offer considering the inflation.  I'd rather get 50 now than risk getting nothing later."
