I'm taking a big chunk of the money, but leaving Bob with something to make him think about accepting. I want to see if he's greedy or if he'll play it safe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to try and get a bigger share. I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'll take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm still taking the majority, but I'm offering a bigger share to Bob to incentivize him to accept. With inflation, the money is losing value rapidly, so I'm willing to compromise a bit. Hopefully, he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept."
