"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more to compensate for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point.  Alice's offer is not terrible, but it's worth seeing if we can get a better deal in the next round.  Since you're not losing any money due to inflation in this round, you have nothing to lose by rejecting and seeing what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time.  We can both benefit from a fair deal, and avoid the risk of inflation in the later rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but the inflation is significant for me. This offer is fair considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than the 50/50 split I proposed, and the inflation is starting to become a real factor. Accepting this offer guarantees a decent amount of money for me, while rejecting it risks losing even more in future rounds."
