"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the further decrease in the value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'll take $5,500 and leave you with $4,500."
