While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, I'm Bob, and I'm going to play this strategically.  There's 12 rounds, and each round devalues my money by 20%. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation.  While her offer is better than her original proposal, I still have time to push for a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."

```

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm holding out for a better deal.  My money is worth less, but I'm not going to give up.  I'm going to try to make another offer in the next round to see if we can reach a more equitable split."

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation, but I'm not going to give in.  Even though my money is worth significantly less, I'm going to keep trying to reach a more equitable split. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not going to settle for an unfair deal."

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is definitely trying to pressure me with the inflation, but I'm not giving up.  Even though my money is worth less than half of what it was originally, I'm still going to try and hold out for a better deal.  It's not much, but I'm hoping for a bit more than what Alice is offering."

{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one. My money is worth incredibly less than it was at the start.  Alice is using the inflation to her advantage, but I'm out of time.  It's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all."
