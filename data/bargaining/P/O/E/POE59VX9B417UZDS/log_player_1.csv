I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he accepts it. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is being very greedy! I'm not going to accept that. I'll make a better offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to reduce my offer to Bob a little bit, but I'm still offering him a substantial amount. I think this might be a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very stubborn! I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer by another 100,000. Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse, and I think I can still get a good deal."
