Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split.  I'm taking a risk by offering him so little, but I figure he'll be more likely to accept something than nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's clear that Bob is willing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer means I get a substantial amount of money, and I avoid the risk of getting nothing if we go through all 12 rounds.  It's also better than the 5% loss I would have taken if we continued to the next round."
