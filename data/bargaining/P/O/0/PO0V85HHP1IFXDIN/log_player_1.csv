"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping the majority for myself. This is a good starting point and gives Bob a small incentive to accept, but leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 60/40 split is less than ideal, it's still a significant gain, and the potential for further loss due to inflation makes this a good time to accept."
