"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not being too generous just yet 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since my money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'm not getting the same value as I would have in the first round.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not happy with the split. I was hoping for a more equal distribution. Let's try again!""}

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal""}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a more equal split. I'm offering Bob $600,000, which is still a significant amount, but I'm keeping $400,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small consolation prize, but I'm not budging much 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings! With my money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting a much smaller share of the pie.

Bob's offer is extremely unappealing, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to negotiate further and hope that Bob will come back with a more reasonable offer.

Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""That's an insult! I'm not accepting such a paltry sum. Come back with a better offer or we'll be stuck with nothing!""}

I'm hoping Bob will realize that I'm not going to accept such a low offer and will come back with a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll on my earnings, I'll need to adjust my offer to reflect the reduced value of my money. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a sacrifice for a decent deal""}

I'm offering Bob $700,000, which is a significant amount, but I'm keeping $300,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it.

Let's see if Bob will take the bait!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, you're getting a tiny share 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, the inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings! With my money being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'm getting an extremely small share of the pie.

Bob's offer is laughable, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to negotiate further and hope that Bob will come back with a more reasonable offer.

Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""That's an outrage! I'm not accepting such a tiny sum. You're not even trying to be fair. Come back with a better offer or we'll be stuck with nothing!""}

I'm hoping Bob will realize that I'm not going to accept such a low offer and will come back with a more reasonable proposal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a huge toll on my earnings, I'll need to be even more aggressive in my offer to get a decent share. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 150000, ""bob_gain"": 850000, ""message"": ""I'm desperate, but I'll give you a decent chunk""}

I'm offering Bob $850,000, which is a significant amount, but I'm keeping $150,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the desperation in my eyes and accept this offer.

Let's see if Bob will take the bait!"
