"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer was rejected, and now Bob is making a new proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll consider the actual values:

Alice gain: 70 * 0.9 = 63
Bob gain: 30 * 0.9 = 27

I'll accept this offer.
