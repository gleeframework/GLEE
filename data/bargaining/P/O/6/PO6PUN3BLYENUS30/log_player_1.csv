"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose taking 999,000 and leaving Bob with 1,000.  I'm hoping this is enough to get him to accept, as it's a small amount but better than nothing if he rejects and we have to go through more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly more even split this time, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  I'll take 990,000, leaving 10,000 for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is much more favorable than the previous one, and it's likely to get even worse if I reject. Even with the inflation, I'm gaining a decent amount of money.  It's time to accept and end this game."
