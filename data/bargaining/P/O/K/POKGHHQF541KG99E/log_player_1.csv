"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, hoping Bob will agree to a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take more, huh?

I'm not sure if I want to give him more, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll accept this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
