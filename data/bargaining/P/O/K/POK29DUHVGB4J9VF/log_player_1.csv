Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 900,000 / 100,000 split in my favor.  I want to get a large chunk of the money, but I also don't want to risk Bob rejecting this and making me wait for the next round.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this is a much worse deal than my initial offer, it's better than getting nothing. The inflation is hitting me hard, and I don't want to risk losing even more money by rejecting and waiting for the next round."
