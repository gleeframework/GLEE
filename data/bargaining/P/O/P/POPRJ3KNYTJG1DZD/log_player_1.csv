"Round 1

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and giving me only $4,000 is a significant difference. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all! Giving me only $3,000 is a huge difference from the original $5,000 I was hoping for, and the inflation is making things even harder. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much more""}

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not going to accept this offer, even though Bob is getting desperate. Giving me only $2,500 is a very poor offer, and I'm not going to settle for that. I'll keep trying to negotiate for a better deal."
