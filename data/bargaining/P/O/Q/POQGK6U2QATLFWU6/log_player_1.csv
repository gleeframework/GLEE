Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split it 60/40, as I'm taking more risk by rejecting your offer. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm still losing value, but this offer is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and the value of his share is plummeting. While his offer is technically better than my previous one, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round.  I need to apply more pressure."
