"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start with a clean slate.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This seems like a fair and straightforward way to start the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400000, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the first proposal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll need to think carefully about whether 400,000 is a good deal. On the other hand, Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he's getting a slightly better deal than he would have in the first round.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me, 300,000 is a relatively small amount. On the other hand, Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, so he's getting a slightly better deal than he would have in the first round.
