"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for the first offer.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can find a more equitable split.  This offer gives you a good starting point, but let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer wasn't bad, but the value decreases quickly. Let's meet closer to the middle ground while it's still worthwhile for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, the inflation is a serious factor.  Alice's offer is more reasonable than my previous one, and I don't want to risk losing more value by continuing to negotiate."
