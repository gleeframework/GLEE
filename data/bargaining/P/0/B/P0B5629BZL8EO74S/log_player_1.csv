"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I'm not going to give you all the money.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly lower share, but I think this is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up too much of the money, and I think I can do better than a 75-25 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to keep a bit more for myself. This is a fair offer, I think.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, which is a 55.5-44.5 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly. I think this is a fair and reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a fair offer, and it's a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer and end the game."
