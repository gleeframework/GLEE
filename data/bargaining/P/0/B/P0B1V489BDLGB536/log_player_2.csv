"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get the rest.  We can work it out from there.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""That's a very generous offer Alice, but hardly fair. How about a 70/30 split in my favour?  It's in your best interest to make a deal quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40. We both get a decent amount, and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, time is working heavily against her. Accepting a 40/60 split now is not much better than waiting for a potential 45/55 split in the next round. The longer she waits, the more desperate she'll become."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time.  I'm offering you 35%, a reasonable deal considering the time pressure.  Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer.  Let's split it 40/60 this time. This is a fair offer given the circumstances. Let's move on before the money is completely worthless. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally crossed the threshold and is offering a larger share to me than herself. Given the rapid inflation, particularly for Alice, it's no longer worth holding out for a slightly larger share. Accepting now locks in a reasonable gain before the value deteriorates further."
