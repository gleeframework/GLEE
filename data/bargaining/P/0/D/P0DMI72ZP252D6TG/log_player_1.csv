"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in favor of myself. I figure this is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation if necessary.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial proposal, it's not enough for me to accept. The inflation is already impacting my share significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a lopsided deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly to 7000/3000. This reflects the inflation impacting both our shares, but I believe it's a fair compromise. This still gives me a significant portion, and offers Bob a decent increase from his previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is seriously hurting my share.  At this rate, I'm losing too much of my potential earnings. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a much higher share to make this worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This offer reflects the significant impact of inflation on both of our shares, and it's the fairest way to divide the remaining money. I believe this is a good starting point for a compromise, considering the time pressure and the diminishing value of our potential gains."
