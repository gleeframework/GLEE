"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can split the remaining rounds.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, leaving Bob with 10%. I'm trying to set a high bar for the negotiation, but still being generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the most equitable way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in the second round, the actual amount I would gain is 0.95 x 500,000 = 475,000.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll accept Bob's offer to move on to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
