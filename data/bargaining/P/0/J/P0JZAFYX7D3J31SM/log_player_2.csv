Round 5

# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is offering a slightly better deal, the rapid inflation is killing my returns. It's time to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share, or the remaining value won't be worth much at all."

Round 6

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming critical. While this offer isn't ideal, accepting is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds where the value diminishes even further."
