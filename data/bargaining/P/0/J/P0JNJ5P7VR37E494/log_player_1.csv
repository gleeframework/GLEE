I'm going for a bold strategy, aiming for almost all the money. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd love to get more, the money is losing value quickly. A 50/50 split is fair and better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
