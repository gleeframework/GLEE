Let's see if Bob likes a generous 90/10 split!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not happy with an even split. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

I'll offer Bob a 60/40 split this time.  I'm hoping this is more appealing to him, considering his gains are worth less with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

I'm still holding out for a better deal!  I'll see what I can get in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again to 70/30.  Bob's gains are depreciating significantly, so hopefully this will be enough to convince him."
