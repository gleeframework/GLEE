"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice, the total amount is now 9,000$ for me and 9,500$ for Alice.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, the total amount is now 9,000$ for me and 9,500$ for Alice, but the actual values are 7,000$ for me and 8,625$ for Alice.

My initial calculation was wrong. Here's the correct calculation for Alice's offer:

Alice's gain: 7500, which is 9.75% less than 8,250 (10,000 * 0.825, 1 - 0.175)
My gain: 2500, which is 19% less than 3,125 (10,000 * 0.3125, 1 - 0.6875)

I'll accept Alice's offer this time.
