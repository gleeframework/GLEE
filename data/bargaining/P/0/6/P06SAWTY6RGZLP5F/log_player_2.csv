Round 5

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to push me closer to her initial offer.  While the decreasing value due to inflation is a concern, accepting now would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to even my previous offers. It's worth the risk to see if I can get her closer to a 50/50 split or a slightly better deal for me."
