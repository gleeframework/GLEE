"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this round, the total amount of money is still $100, but my gain of $50 is worth 90% of its original value due to inflation. So, my effective gain is $50 x 0.9 = $45.

I'll evaluate Bob's offer based on this effective gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the money and Bob gets 45%. I'm framing it as a ""compromise"" to see if Bob will accept it."
