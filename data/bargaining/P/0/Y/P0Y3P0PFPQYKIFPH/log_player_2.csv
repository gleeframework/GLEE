"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While Alice is being friendly and open to negotiation, she's starting with a heavily skewed split in her favor. It's worth seeing what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. This offer recognizes your initial advantage, but time is money.  We both lose if this drags on."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but we need to reach a deal quickly before the value of the money drops too much. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting closer, but it's still not a great deal for me.  She's clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, which works in my favor. Let's see if I can push my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation.  Let's close this out and both walk away with something substantial."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the money evenly now, as the inflation is significantly impacting us both. Let's end this negotiation and get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally willing to agree to a fair 50/50 split. While I might have been able to push for a slightly better deal in earlier rounds, the inflation is eating into the value quickly. Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable share, which is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
