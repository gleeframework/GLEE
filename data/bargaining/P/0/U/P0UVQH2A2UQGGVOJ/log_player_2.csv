"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $60, you get $40.  A fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'll take $60 and leave you with $40.  This way, we both get a slightly higher share before the inflation hits too hard.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a smaller hit from inflation than you. $55 for me and $45 for you is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly. I'll take $55 and you can have $45. We're both losing value due to inflation, so let's make this quick and fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I understand you want a good deal, but we're both losing money the longer this goes on. I'm coming down to $52, you get $48.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is getting close to my ideal split, and with each round, the value of the money is decreasing. It's better to take the deal now and avoid further inflation losses."
