Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better.  I'm taking a bigger risk with the decreasing value of my share, so I propose we split it 55/45. Let's work together! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
