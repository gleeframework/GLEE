Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very uneven split, hoping Bob will accept in the first round.  I'll keep a close eye on inflation and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. Inflation is a serious factor, and with the money worth less each round, taking a 50/50 split is the most sensible choice to ensure I get something at all."
