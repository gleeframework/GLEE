Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! We both deserve a fair share.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're running out of time! Inflation is eating away at your share. Be smart and take this offer before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to use time pressure against me. While the inflation is impacting my potential gains, accepting an offer where I receive less than Bob is not strategically sound. I need to counter with a firm offer, but one that might seem more appealing to him as we approach the later rounds."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's time to get real. Inflation is killing your share, and you're running out of options. Take this 50/50 split and let's end this game before you lose even more. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of my potential gain diminishes significantly. Waiting longer means risking a much smaller share.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently aimed for a larger share and seems unwilling to budge much.  
* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point. Holding out for a significantly better deal is too risky now. 

A 50/50 split ensures I at least receive a reasonable portion of the money, even with the impact of inflation."
