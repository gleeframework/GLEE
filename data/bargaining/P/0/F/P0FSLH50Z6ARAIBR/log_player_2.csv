"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we can both enjoy our gains. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's early in the game, and I'm confident I can get more. Plus, the money isn't losing value for me, but it is for Alice, so I have some leverage. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice! We both deserve a fair share.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a more balanced split. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait. But I'm still willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Your turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being very fair, Bob. Consider the time pressure and the fact that this is my last offer above 700,000. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not buying the ""last offer above 700,000"" threat. Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not falling for it. The money is still worth the same to me, and I believe I can get a better deal. Plus, Alice is starting to feel the pressure of inflation, so I'll let her sweat a bit more. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, you're running out of time! Inflation is eating away at your share. Be smart and take this offer before it's too late.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll increase my share slightly, taking advantage of Alice's growing desperation. With each passing round, the money is worth less to her, so I'm hoping she'll start to feel the pressure and accept my offer. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not intimidated by Alice's ""final offer"" threat. She's trying to create a sense of urgency, but I know she's desperate to get a deal done before the money loses even more value. I'll call her bluff and reject the offer. With inflation eating away at her share, I'm confident I can get an even better deal in the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, it's time to get real. Inflation is killing your share, and you're running out of options. Take this 50/50 split and let's end this game before you lose even more.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a bold move and offer a 50/50 split. With Alice's share losing value rapidly, I'm hoping she'll realize that this is the best deal she's going to get. I'm willing to take a risk and offer her an equal split, knowing that I have the upper hand in this negotiation. Will she accept?"
