Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept it, especially since he doesn't know about the inflation.  If he rejects it, I'll be able to adjust my offer in the next round to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd like to get more money, I'm not sure how much longer we'll be able to play this game before Bob gets greedy and starts taking more. I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
