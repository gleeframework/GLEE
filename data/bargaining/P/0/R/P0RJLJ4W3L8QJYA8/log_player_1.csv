"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 90-10. Let's see if we can do better from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm open to negotiating and improving the offer from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to start with a 95-5 split, recognizing that the money is worth less each round. Let's find a good outcome that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a big difference from the previous round! I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity. Let's try to find a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping to find a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to find a more balanced split. I'm willing to compromise and give you 40% of the remaining money. Let's see if we can make a deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping to find a more balanced outcome."
