Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit less, but still more than I should

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While the deal is getting worse, accepting $4,500 now is better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds.  However, I still believe I can get Alice to agree to a slightly better deal in the next few rounds. The threat of me getting nothing might push her to be more generous."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution.  Take it before inflation hurts me even more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're really running out of time now, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While the offer is far from ideal, I need to be realistic.  Accepting $4,300 is much better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. Alice is clearly content to drag this out, knowing the inflation is hurting me more than her.  It's better to take what I can get at this point."
