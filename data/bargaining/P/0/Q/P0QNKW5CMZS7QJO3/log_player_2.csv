"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob.  I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not going to accept a deal where I get $1! Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split, Alice. Take it or leave it, but I'm sure we can both do better than your last offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to go.  This time I'm serious. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
A 50/50 split is a fair deal, especially since Alice's money is worth less than before. I'll take it."
