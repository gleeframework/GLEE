"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still have the same $5,000 to gain, but for Bob, the money is worth 10% less, so he's offering me $4,000, which is a good deal for me.

I'll accept this offer.
