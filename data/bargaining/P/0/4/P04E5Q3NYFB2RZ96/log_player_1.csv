"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get the majority of the money. I'll think carefully... 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal now that the money is worth less. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm aiming for a slightly higher share, but still willing to compromise."
