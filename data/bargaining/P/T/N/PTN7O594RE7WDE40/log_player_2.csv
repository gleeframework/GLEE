"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness with Urgency:**  Alice's 60/40 split was unfair. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split, acknowledging the time-value of money with each passing round.
* **Slight Advantage:** Giving myself a slight edge (5250) incentivizes Alice to accept, knowing the pot will be smaller next round. 
* **Direct Message:**  The message conveys a sense of fairness while also adding a touch of pressure to make a decision quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob, meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer this goes on, the less the money is worth. Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal now is better than risking an even worse offer later.
* **Middle Ground:** Alice has moved closer to a 50/50 split, showing a willingness to compromise.  
* **Avoiding Risk:** Rejecting this offer means I'm betting on getting a better deal in a future round, which is not guaranteed."
