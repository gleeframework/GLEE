I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This leaves a significant portion for Bob while ensuring I get the majority share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than my initial offer, it's still not fair given that my gains are worth significantly less due to inflation. I need a better deal to compensate for the reduced value of my share. I'll reject and see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. While inflation has devalued my share, I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid further rounds of negotiation.  This should be a reasonable offer considering the current value of the money."
