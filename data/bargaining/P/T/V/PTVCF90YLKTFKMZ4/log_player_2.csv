Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a slightly bigger share this round, but I'm sure we can reach a fair compromise soon!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable compromise 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Even though the inflation is eating away at my gains, it's not worth risking getting nothing in the next round. I'll take the 55/45 split."
