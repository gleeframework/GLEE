"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. The message is a friendly invitation to consider the offer and decide what to do next."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'm hoping for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is worth 95% of what it was in Round 1, so it's actually $47.50.

I'm not eager to give up half of the remaining amount, so I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher gain to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Your turn to think!""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $55 and Bob $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $45 is worth 85.74% of what it was in Round 1, so it's actually $38.35.

Considering the decreasing value of money and the fact that I'm already at a lower value than in the previous round, I'll accept Bob's offer.
