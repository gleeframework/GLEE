"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 seems reasonable to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 80-20 is a fairer split considering the initial offer was too generous. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $2,000 is actually worth 90% of what it was in the previous round, so it's equivalent to $1,800 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
