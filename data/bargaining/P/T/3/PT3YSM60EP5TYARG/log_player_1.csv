Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000

I'll decide to reject this offer.

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering a slightly more favorable split than before, I'll decide to...
