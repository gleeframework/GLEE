"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40, I'm willing to negotiate""
}
```

I'm looking forward to hearing back from Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your money is devaluating quickly, Alice. Let's be reasonable and split 55-45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round. The 20% inflation is steep, but I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I know my money's value is dropping fast, but I still think 58-42 is fair considering the initial offer""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my last offer.  Take it or leave it.  It's better than anything you'll get in round 5. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the rapid devaluation of my potential gains, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer. The difference in inflation rates is really taking its toll, and I don't think I can afford to wait another round. Bob's warning that this is his last offer also suggests that he might not be willing to compromise further. I'll take the 40 dollars and cut my losses."
