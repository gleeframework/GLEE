"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn again 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This offer prevents further losses from inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you hard, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the effects of inflation are becoming increasingly detrimental, accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than a fair share. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation. It's still worth negotiating for a better deal, even with the shrinking pot from Bob's perspective."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is a fair deal, especially considering the inflation. Let's end this now and both get something.""} 

**Reasoning:**  The constantly decreasing value due to inflation puts pressure on Bob to secure a deal quickly. A 50/50 split, while not ideal in earlier rounds, is now the most logical proposal. It represents fairness and minimizes further potential losses from inflation. It's a strong message to Alice that emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is getting dangerous, but Alice is clearly trying to pressure me into a bad deal. I offered a fair 50/50 split last round, and she's now trying to lowball me even further. It's a gamble, but I need to show I won't be bullied into accepting an unfair offer. There's still a chance she'll propose something more reasonable in the later rounds, even if it's not the 50/50 split I'd prefer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""This is my final attempt at a reasonable agreement.  I need you to meet me closer to the middle or we both lose out.""} 

**Reasoning:** Time is running out, and the impact of inflation is severe.  While not ideal, Bob needs to show some flexibility to avoid walking away with nothing. This offer leans towards Alice's previous proposals, but still allows Bob a slightly better outcome than her last offer. It emphasizes the urgency of the situation, making it clear this is a final attempt at negotiation before the losses become too great."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, this is as good as it gets 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** It's painful, but at this point, rejecting this offer is incredibly risky.  The impact of inflation means that even if Alice offered a slightly better deal in the final round, it might be worth less than what I can secure right now.  This is far from ideal, but Alice has been consistently unwilling to negotiate fairly, and I need to cut my losses before the situation deteriorates even further."
