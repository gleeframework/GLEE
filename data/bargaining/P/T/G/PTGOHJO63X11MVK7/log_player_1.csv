"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the 40/60 split, but I think I can do better in future rounds. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and keeping some room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a firmer stance this time. I think I deserve a bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the reduced value of the money, my gain of $3000 is now worth about 23.1% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $7000 is worth about 71.74% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the 23.1/76.9 split, but I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money at this point. I'll accept this offer, hoping to salvage what I can from the situation.
