Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very unequal split.  I want the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to hopefully make him accept it. I think it's likely he'll accept, as he's getting something, but I have a lot of rounds to play with and I can adjust my offer later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's less than I initially wanted, accepting this offer secures a decent amount of money.  I'm not sure how inflation will continue to affect us, and it's better to take what I can get now."
