"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you $400,000 and I'll take the remaining $600,000. It's a fair split, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation kicking in, my gain is now worth even less.

I'll have to think carefully... But I think I'll take the offer. The inflation is affecting me more than Bob, so I'd rather get something now than risk waiting for a better deal that might never come.
