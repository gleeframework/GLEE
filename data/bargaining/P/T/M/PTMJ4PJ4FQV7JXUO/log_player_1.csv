"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll be getting $540,000 (600,000 x 0.9).

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 1/3 share, and I think I can do better in the next round."

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the next round of inflation, my potential gain is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so I'll be getting $729,000 (600,000 x 0.729).

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:
