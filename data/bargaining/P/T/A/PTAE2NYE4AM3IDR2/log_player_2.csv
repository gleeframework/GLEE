"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 55/45.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than 45. Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we should split it 55/45, but in my favor this time.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I want to try to end the game as quickly as possible while still getting a good deal. Offering 55/45 in my favor gives me a bit more than Alice's initial offer, but still seems somewhat reasonable. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I need a bit more than 45. Let's split it 60/40, and we can finally get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, and I think I can still do better. Since the money is worth 36% less for me now, I want to try to get a bit more to make up for the loss in value. Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less than 45, but I need more than 55. Let's split it 58/42 and wrap this up.""}\n\nSince the money is worth even less for me now, I want to try to get a bit more to make up for the loss in value. Offering 58/42 gives me a bit more than my previous offer, but still seems somewhat reasonable. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer and we can end the game."
