"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my initial offer.  I'm taking the lion's share, as I'm the one making the proposal. I'll be interested to see if Bob accepts or counters.  Let's see how this game plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I think it's better to accept this offer and end the game.  Bob's offer is much fairer than my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we continue to reject each other's proposals."
