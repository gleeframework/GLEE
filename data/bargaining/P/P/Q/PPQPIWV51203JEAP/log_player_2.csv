"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after one round of inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my share of $40 is worth 64% of the original $25 I was offered in round 1. This is a better deal than the original offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my share of $40 is worth 64% of the original $25, and the money is worth 64% of its original value. I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

Since the money is worth 64% of its original value, I'll aim to get 64% of the original $25, which is $16. However, I'll offer a bit more to account for the fact that the money is worth less.
