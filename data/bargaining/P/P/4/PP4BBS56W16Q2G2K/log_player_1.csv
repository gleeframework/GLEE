"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it before we have to deal with the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the effects of inflation, my gain is now worth even less. I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is equal, it's a 50-50 split, but I was hoping for a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, my gain is worth 20% less than in round 2, so I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the value of the money! With my gain being worth only 48.8% of what it was initially, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still a 50-50 split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll accept this offer.
