"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm keeping the majority, but you still get a good chunk.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
It's only the first round and the money is still worth a lot. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think this is a fairer starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to keep a majority. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer is the safest choice to ensure I get at least something."
