"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  This offer is more fair, and we can end the game now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""This isn't fair, Bob. Let's try to find a more equitable split."" 
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's try this again. This offer is still favorable to me, but gives you a better deal than before.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way, and we can avoid more inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, a 50/50 split seems fair in light of the inflation."" 
}
``` 

Even though I could potentially gain more, the inflation is working against Bob. Accepting a 50/50 split now ensures we both get a reasonable amount. It's better to secure a win than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
