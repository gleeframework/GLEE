Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a compromise considering the time pressure and the decreasing value. Let's settle this now.

**Reasoning:**

- **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the money loses value for both of us, but especially for Bob. This puts increasing pressure on him to make a deal. 
- **Acceptable Offer:** While not ideal, getting $5,500 after inflation is better than risking getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 
- **Bob's Declining Position:** Bob's offer in Round 4 is actually worse for him than his offer in Round 2. This suggests he's feeling the pressure and might be willing to concede further in future rounds if I reject this offer, but the risk of walking away with nothing is too high."
