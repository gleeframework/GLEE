"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $80 in the next round. I'll make a counteroffer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 36 
# Alice gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 36% less for me now, and it was worth 20% less in the previous round, it's equivalent to 56% of the original value. So, $100 is equivalent to $56 in the next round. I'll make a new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52}"
