Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I believe in a more balanced approach that reflects the risk we both take by continuing. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
Although Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, the devaluation of the money makes this offer significantly worse for me than my previous offer to him.  It's worth risking another round to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is literally money! This offer is a good compromise to avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Bob is catching on to the impact of inflation, but his offer is still not favorable.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it's a slight improvement. The time pressure is working against him more than me."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 620000,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be fair, but this back and forth is hurting us both. Let's settle this now with a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

This is a tough one! Bob is getting closer to a split I might accept, but the deal is still worse for me than what I offered in Round 3.  The inflation is hurting him more than me, so I'm willing to gamble that he'll concede more in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it, but we're running out of time! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Bob is finally catching up with the reality of the situation. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
