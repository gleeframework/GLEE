"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50. This way, we can both get a decent amount and avoid any potential disputes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. He's offering me $40, which is worth 80% of what I would have gotten in the first round. I'm not sure if it's a good deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to accept this offer for now.
