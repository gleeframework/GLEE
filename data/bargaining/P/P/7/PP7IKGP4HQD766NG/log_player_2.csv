Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair split. My previous offer was already generous considering the inflation.  This offer is a compromise, still favoring you slightly compared to a 50/50 split after three rounds of devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a clever game, using the threat of inflation to push for a larger share. However, her offer still heavily favors her. Rejecting keeps the pressure on and shows I'm serious about a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is generous considering the inflation we're both facing. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  Offering Alice slightly more than half shows I'm willing to compromise, but not be taken advantage of. 
* **Strong Call to Action:**  The message urges Alice to make a decision and emphasizes the negative consequences of delay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the deadline. This offer is a serious one. It accounts for the inflation but still gives you a sizable portion. Let's be smart and split the money before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use time pressure to her advantage. While she claims it's a serious offer, it's only a slight improvement from her previous one. Accepting now would mean settling for significantly less than what I initially aimed for. I need to hold firm and demonstrate I'm willing to risk it all for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A perfectly even split.  It's the fairest offer considering the circumstances.  Let's end this before we both lose out.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is very real.  A 50/50 split is the most logical solution at this point.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split removes any argument of unfair advantage due to inflation.  It's a clean and justifiable resolution.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the critical situation and the need for immediate action. Alice should recognize this is the most sensible option remaining."
