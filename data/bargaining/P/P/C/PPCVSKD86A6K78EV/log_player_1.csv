"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm going to propose a split of 9000 for me and 1000 for Bob.  This is a relatively generous offer, especially considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping Bob will see it as fair and accept it to finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though it's a better split for me than the first round, the inflation has reduced my potential winnings significantly. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500} 
``` 

I'm offering Bob 1500 and taking 8500 for myself. I'm decreasing my offer, but still trying to be fair, considering the inflation is now 5%. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and it's a better deal for me than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While the inflation has significantly decreased my potential winnings, the current offer from Bob is better than what I could potentially achieve in the next round. It's a better deal for me than the previous round, and continuing the game only risks further devaluation of my potential gains due to inflation."
