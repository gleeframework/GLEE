"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion. I'm hoping he'll accept in the first round to avoid the potential for inflation to erode our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than what I offered him in the first round, it is still unfavorable to me. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to try to incentivize Bob to accept.  Inflation is starting to bite, and I want to get this deal done before it erodes our gains too much."
