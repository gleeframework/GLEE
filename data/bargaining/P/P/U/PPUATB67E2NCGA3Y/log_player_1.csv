"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit lopsided, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer and running out of rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effecting my gains, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to get a fair deal to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm trying to balance the risk of inflation with the need to get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think this is the best I can do without giving away too much. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. Bob's offer is still not ideal, but it's getting closer to a 50-50 split. I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer and potentially losing out on a significant portion of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer and hope that the compromise is fair."
