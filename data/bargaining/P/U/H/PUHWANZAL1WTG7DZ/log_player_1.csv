"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leave Bob with $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting strong too. Let's see if we can find a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it. However, I'm not sure if I should take it, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds.

I'll reject the offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $550,000, and leave Bob with $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. We can both get a decent amount if we work together. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be reasonable, but I'm not sure if he's being sincere. Considering the inflation, the money Bob gains is now worth even less than before, so I need to be cautious.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round, and this offer is relatively close to my previous proposal. I'll accept this offer to avoid risking a worse deal in the next round.
