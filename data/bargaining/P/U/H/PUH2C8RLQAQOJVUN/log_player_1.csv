"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive offer. I'm banking on Bob being willing to take a small amount to avoid getting nothing in the next round due to the inflation. Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

This is a much fairer offer than my initial proposal, and while I'd love to get more, the risk of getting nothing in the next round due to Bob's inflation is too high.  It's time to secure my share."
