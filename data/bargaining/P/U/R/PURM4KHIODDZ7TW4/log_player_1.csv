Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. We both get the same amount, and we can avoid any more rounds.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly again, Alice. We're losing money with each round, and this is the fairest way to avoid losing it all. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress, and the inflation is eating into his potential gains.  I'll continue to hold out for a slightly better deal. While the 50/50 split seems fair in principle, the inflation mechanic means it's actually disadvantageous to me in the long run."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. Let's split it evenly again and avoid any further losses. This is the fairest way to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on with fewer rounds remaining, I still believe Bob will fold soon. He's losing considerably more to inflation with each passing round.  My offers are edging closer to a 50/50 split, but I think there's still room for him to make a concession in the next round or two."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.  Take it or leave it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to apply real pressure. I'm moving my offer closer to a 50/50 split, but  making it clear this is my final offer. The rapidly increasing inflation for Bob means he has a lot more to lose than I do if we don't make a deal soon."
