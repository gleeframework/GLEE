"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split, giving me 75% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it 60/40, a more balanced proposal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll re-evaluate the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, the effective value of the money I'd gain is $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less, so the effective value of the money he'd gain is $600,000 * 0.9 = $540,000.

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, I'll give you a better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values of the money considering the inflation:

My gain is worth 48.8% less than the initial $1,000,000, so the effective value of the money I'd gain is $300,000 * 0.5132 = $153,960 (approximately).
For Bob, the money is worth 27.1% less, so the effective value of the money he'd gain is $700,000 * 0.7279 = $509,133 (approximately).

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's call it a tie, 50/50 split!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, trying to find a fair and equal division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values of the money considering the inflation:

My gain is worth 67.23% less than the initial $1,000,000, so the effective value of the money I'd gain is $150,000 * 0.3331 = $49,965 (approximately).
For Bob, the money is worth 40.95% less, so the effective value of the money he'd gain is $850,000 * 0.5921 = $502,385 (approximately).

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
