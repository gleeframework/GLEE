"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 
I propose taking $90 and giving Bob $10.  I figure that since I'm making the first offer, I should take a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing by rejecting and then having to make an offer myself."
