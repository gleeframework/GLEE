"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous 30% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the offer from Bob.

After considering the proposal, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, as I think I can do better than 40% of the total amount. The game will continue to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $440,000, which is 44% of the current value of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game!"
