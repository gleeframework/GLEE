"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to prioritize my own gain to make up for the difference.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering a slightly biased split in my favor, hoping to secure a better deal before the value of the money continues to decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! Since the money I gain is worth even less now, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is almost the same as his previous offer, but with a slightly higher share for me. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations.
