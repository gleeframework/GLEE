I'm taking nearly all the money, Bob.  Since the money is worth less to me with every round, I'm incentivized to get as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the money.  This is a significant decrease from his previous offer, but it's still more than he would get if we continue to play.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I need to secure a decent amount of money before it gets too bad."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. The inflation has hit me hard, and I'm risking losing even more if I continue. 100,000 is better than nothing at this point."
