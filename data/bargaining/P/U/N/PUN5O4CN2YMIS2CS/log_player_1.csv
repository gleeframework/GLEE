"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This is a fairly generous offer, especially considering the inflation factor will impact me more than Bob. Let's see if he's willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is much worse for me than my previous proposal. While I have to accept that I won't get the full $900,000, I can still do better than this. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer a bit to $800,000 for me and $200,000 for Bob. The inflation is definitely hurting me, but I still believe I can get a better deal than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is even worse than the previous one, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic loss. Even with inflation, I'm confident I can negotiate a more balanced division. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a lower offer of $700,000 for myself and $300,000 for Bob. This is a significant compromise, but it's the best I can do considering the inflation."
