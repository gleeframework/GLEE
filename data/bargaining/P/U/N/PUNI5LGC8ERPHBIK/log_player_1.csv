"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect in mind, I think I can do better than that.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... Bob's offer is identical to the one I made in Round 3, but with the correct inflation adjustment applied to his share. I think I'll take advantage of this!

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4."
