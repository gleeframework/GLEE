"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It's getting late in the game, Bob.  I'll take a little less, but this is as low as I'm going.  It's better to take this than risk inflation eating further into your share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, it's the best option for Bob at this point.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The 36% inflation rate is severely eroding Bob's potential gains. Waiting longer will only make the situation worse.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice explicitly stated this is her lowest offer. Holding out hoping for a better deal is unlikely. 

It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed $4500 now than risk getting an even worse offer later, or even reaching a point where any potential gain is almost entirely eaten by inflation."
