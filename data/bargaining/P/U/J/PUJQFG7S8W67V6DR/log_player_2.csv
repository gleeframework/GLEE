Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be strategic. I understand your desire for a 55/45 split, but the decreasing value significantly impacts us both. My offer ensures you get more than you would if you wait for another round. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about the decreasing value, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm willing to gamble another round to try and secure a more equitable split. The difference between her offer and my previous offer is significant enough to warrant the risk of another round of inflation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we need to find a compromise. The decreasing value is hurting us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest solution at this point. Let's end this before we both lose out further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is starting to become a significant factor.  While I believe I had a stronger negotiating position earlier, prolonging this any further will only harm both of us. A 50/50 split, even with the applied inflation, is better than risking another round and potentially getting a worse offer."
