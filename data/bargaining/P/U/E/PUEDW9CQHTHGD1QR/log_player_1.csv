"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly higher share this time, but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting less valuable by the minute!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation rates, I'll have to be careful not to give up too much.

For now, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up $7,000 just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to keep some buffer for the remaining rounds. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meeting in the middle, but I think I can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly!

I'm not thrilled about splitting it 50/50, but I think it's a reasonable compromise given the circumstances. I'd rather have some money now than risk losing everything in the remaining rounds.

I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like I'll be taking home $5,000, and Bob will get $5,000. Better than nothing, right?"
