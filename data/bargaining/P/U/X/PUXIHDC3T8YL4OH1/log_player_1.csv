"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent chunk to keep you happy.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% to me and 20% to Bob, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. We can both walk away happy with a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the offer is equivalent to:

* Alice gain: 4000
* Bob gain: 4000

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
