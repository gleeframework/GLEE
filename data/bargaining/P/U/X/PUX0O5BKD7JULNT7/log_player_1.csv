"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 is a good start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my potential gain is now $9,000 (not $9,000, but $9,000 is the amount I had proposed in the first round, and I'm comparing it to the $10,000 of the first round). Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll get $5,000, which is more than my original proposal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
