Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of money due to inflation. It's worth risking another round to aim for a better split.  Alice is clearly trying to push me towards a less favorable outcome, but I believe I still have some leverage."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  A slight advantage for you, but it avoids the risk of both of us walking away with nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a smaller step back 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and Alice's offer is now barely better than a 50/50 split after accounting for the lost value.  While I'd prefer a more even split, the risk of getting nothing is too high at this point. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable, albeit diminished, payout."
