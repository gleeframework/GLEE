"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm willing to give you a generous offer. Accept and we can both enjoy our share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a 30% share of the initial $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle and split the difference. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in Round 2, my share of $700,000 is now worth $630,000.

I'm not too keen on Bob's offer, as it's not a significant compromise from his initial rejection. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so my target share is now worth $561,000 (10% less than $630,000).

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a decent share. Think about it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my target share of $630,000 is now worth $457,170 (27.1% less than $630,000).

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as it's still not a significant compromise from his previous offers. However, I'm getting closer to my target share, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller target.
