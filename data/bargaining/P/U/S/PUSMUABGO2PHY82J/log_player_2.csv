Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is quite generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  The value is decreasing each round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right about the value decreasing, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing, Alice is not budging much on her offer. It's better to hold out and see if she'll offer a more even split in the next round.  There's a risk, but the potential loss from this offer outweighs the potential gain in my eyes."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation each round. This offer is the best you'll get from me.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to start making concessions. While a 50/50 split is ideal in principle, I need to acknowledge that Alice is in a stronger bargaining position. Offering 48/52 shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still seeking a reasonably fair deal considering the inflation."
