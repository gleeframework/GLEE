I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly and avoid the inflation risk. I'll keep a large portion for myself while still giving Bob something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though Bob's offer is generous, it's still significantly less than what I offered him in the first round.  I'm willing to risk another round of inflation in hopes of getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time to entice him, but I'm still keeping the majority for myself. With inflation, my share is worth less each round, so I need to secure a good portion while I can."
