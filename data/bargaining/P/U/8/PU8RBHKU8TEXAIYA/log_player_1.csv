Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a more even split is in order. How about 60/40? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to 55% but I need to see some movement from your end as well.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you seems fair considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a bigger share, it's getting late in the game and the inflation is hitting me hard. Accepting Bob's offer is the best way to secure some of the money before it's worth even less."
