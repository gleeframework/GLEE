Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest given the inflation.  Let's avoid further rounds and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer might seem fair on the surface, but the inflation heavily favors me as the game goes on. I need to push for a better deal while the money still holds significant value for him."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a little more to close this deal. Let's meet in the middle and get this done. The inflation is hurting both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is offering slightly more, the rate at which his share is devaluing is accelerating. It's still beneficial for me to hold out a bit longer and aim for a more favorable split as the inflation increasingly impacts his potential gains."
