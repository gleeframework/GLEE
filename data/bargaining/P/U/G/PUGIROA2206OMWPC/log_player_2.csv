Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. While I understand the inflation affects you more, a 55/45 split is a fair compromise, and it's still better than waiting another round and getting even less. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
