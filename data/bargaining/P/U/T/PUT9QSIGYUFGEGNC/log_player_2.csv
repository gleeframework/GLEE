Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Let's try again, considering the inflation, I'm being generous

# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is more than fair for you 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While she's right that the offer is technically more than what I was offered in Round 3, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid inflation I'm experiencing.  I need to push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a few more rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 53,
""alice_gain"": 47,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we're both losing out the longer this goes on.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and Alice seems determined to push me to the brink. This offer is still favorable to me while acknowledging the time pressure and inflation. By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to signal that I'm serious and push Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't bluff, the inflation is on my side 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly calling my bluff and the time pressure is immense. Accepting a 44/56 split is far from ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing.  I've misjudged Alice's willingness to negotiate and now I have to accept a less favorable outcome."
