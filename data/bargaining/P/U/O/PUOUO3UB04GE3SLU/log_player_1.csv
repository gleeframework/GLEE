"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll still give you a decent share! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $3000 is worth 95% of the original $3000, which is $2850, and Bob's gain of $7000 is worth 80% of the original $7000, which is $5600.

I'll accept Bob's offer for $2850 and $5600.
