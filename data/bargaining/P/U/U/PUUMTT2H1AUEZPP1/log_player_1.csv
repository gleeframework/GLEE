"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the initial $10,000. I'll get $6,000, which is 60%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair. I'll accept a 50-50 split if you prefer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the majority of the money, but he's willing to compromise on a 50-50 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think 50-50 is still too generous to Bob, considering he's already getting a larger share. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, but still offering Bob a significant share. Let's see if he's willing to accept this compromise!"
