"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it's a fair split, so I'm going with the middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to meet me in the middle. That's a good compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer, and we can end the game here."
