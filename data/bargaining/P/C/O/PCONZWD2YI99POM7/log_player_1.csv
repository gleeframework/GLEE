"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'd get $6,000 and Bob would get $4,000. The message is a friendly introduction to the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still a decent offer for you 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $3,000 is actually worth $2,700 in the current round. Bob's gain of $7,000 is still worth $7,000.

I'm not thrilled with the 30-70 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a decent offer considering the game has already progressed to the second round.
