"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. If Bob accepts, we can end the game and I'll get $70 and Bob will get $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go.  Let's end this here and avoid the risks of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $50 is worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's effectively $45.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it would have been in the first round, since the inflation effect on Bob's gain is 20% less, but I'll assume it's 80% for the sake of calculation.

Considering the inflation effect, a 50-50 split doesn't seem as attractive to me as it would have been in the first round. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money I gain is worth 81% of what it would have been in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%), and Bob's gain is worth 64% of what it would have been in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risks of inflation. Accept this and we can still end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which takes into account the inflation effect and gives me a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we're both aware of inflation, I think it's time to be realistic. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, which I believe is fair considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's end this game and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is worth 73.9% of what it would have been in the first round (100% - 26.1% = 73.9%).

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a 60% share, especially since my gain is worth less than 74% of what it would have been in the first round. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the fifth round, the money I gain is worth 54.3% of what it would have been in the first round (100% - 45.7% = 54.3%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. I'm offering a 55-45 split. Accept this and we can still end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which takes into account the inflation effect and gives me a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation at this rate, we're both losing money. It's time to be realistic. I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor, which is the best deal we can both get right now. Let's end this game and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $30 is worth 59.05% of what it would have been in the first round (100% - 40.95% = 59.05%).

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a 70% share, especially since my gain is worth less than 60% of what it would have been in the first round. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal, but I'm running out of time.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the seventh round, the money I gain is worth 40.95% of what it would have been in the first round (100% - 59.05% = 40.95%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something in return. Accept this and we can still try to salvage what's left.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 35-65 split, which takes into account the inflation effect and gives Bob a larger share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get."
