Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I propose an even 50/50 split to end this fairly before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's tempting to try and squeeze out a little more, but accepting the 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair. 
* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Waiting longer means getting a smaller share of a smaller pie. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal in later rounds. He might become more stubborn, especially as the deadline approaches.  

Accepting now secures a decent amount and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
