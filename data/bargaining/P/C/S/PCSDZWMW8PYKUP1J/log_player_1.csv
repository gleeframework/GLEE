Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate and is now offering me less than his previous offer while trying to frame it as the same deal. This indicates I likely have the upper hand and can push for a better offer as the rounds progress."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a perfectly even split.  Take it or leave it - but if you leave it, don't blame me for what happens in the later rounds! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

**Reasoning:** This is a tricky one! While I'd like to push for more, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the safest option.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and Bob's offers are getting more desperate. He might drastically lowball in the next rounds. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While Bob's share is decreasing in value faster than mine, it's unlikely I can secure a deal where I get significantly more than 6400 (my last offer). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting guarantees I get something. Rejecting risks getting nothing if Bob panics and starts making unreasonable offers. 

It's a gamble either way, but accepting the 50/50 split ensures a reasonable outcome at this stage."
