"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$.  I want to leave room for negotiation, but I want to maximize my share as this is the first round and inflation will quickly reduce the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not happy with the offer, the inflation means that waiting will only make my share worse.  I'll take the 100,000$ and end this game."
