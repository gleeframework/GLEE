"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd like a bigger share to compensate for the decreased value of the money Bob gains. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and the previous rejections. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to account for the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself to compensate for the decreased value of the money Bob gains due to inflation."
