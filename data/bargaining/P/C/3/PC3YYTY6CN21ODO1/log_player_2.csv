"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's avoid drawn-out negotiations, Bob. A quick 90/10 split in my favor seems fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's find a compromise. I've lowered my ask considerably.  Time is literally money for you with this inflation, so I suggest taking this 65/35 split. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing money with every passing round, while you're holding out for an unreasonable share.  55/45 is my final offer.""}
