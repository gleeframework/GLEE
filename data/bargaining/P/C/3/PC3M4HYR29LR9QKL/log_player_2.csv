**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly.  By continuing to reject her offers, I signal that I'm willing to risk it all for a more equitable split. It's a risky strategy, but I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the potential losses increase."
