"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the cash""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for Bob now, so I'm more likely to accept a lower offer from him.
