"Round 1
Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's not in my best interest to accept in the first round.  I can likely get a better deal later on, especially considering the inflation advantage I have."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering our different inflation rates. Let's start with that, and we can adjust later if needed.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit less. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is better than what I offered in round 2, and the inflation rate is working against me.  It's a decent split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
