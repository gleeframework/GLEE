"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. The offer is similar to the one I made in the first round, but the values are now lower due to inflation.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
