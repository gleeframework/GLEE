"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60, and you can have 40. We can work out something better later. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's early in the game, and I'm not sure Alice understands the inflation dynamic. It's in my best interest to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Since the money is losing value, I'd like to get a bigger share now.  Let's split it 60/40.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's best we split it evenly now, since the money is losing value quickly.  Let's both take 50. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like to get more, the inflation is hurting Alice more than me.  This is a good deal for me at this point."
