Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. I'm taking a smaller gain to reach an agreement. Let's settle this before we both lose more! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is now getting close to an even split, and the effects of inflation are becoming significant. While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, accepting this offer guarantees a decent amount of money rather than risking getting nothing if we fail to agree."
