Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not going below 57 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is slightly better, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. Accepting now sets a bad precedent for future rounds where my bargaining power diminishes.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I can tell. I'll give you a tiny bit more, but that's it 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to reject and the rounds progress further. Alice is clearly very stubborn and knows time is on her side."
