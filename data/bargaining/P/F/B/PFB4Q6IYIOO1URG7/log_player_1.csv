Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's also fair enough that Bob might accept it. I'm banking on his aversion to risk and the fact that the money will be worth less to him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation makes the offer progressively worse for Bob with each round.  He's likely trying to maximize his gains in this round, knowing that he'll lose more than I will if we continue. Accepting ensures I get at least something, and it's better than risking further losses in subsequent rounds."
