"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the risk of inflation. We can discuss further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think a 60-40 split in Bob's favor is fair, especially considering that the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
