Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While this offer is slightly better than her previous one, accepting it at this stage sets a bad precedent and signals I'm desperate. I need to hold out a bit longer and hope she starts getting nervous as we approach the later rounds."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not backing down, you're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough one, but with the inflation getting so severe, it's risky to push further.  Alice knows the clock is working against me, and she might not budge much more. Taking the slightly smaller amount now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
