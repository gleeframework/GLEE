"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than your initial proposal, but I'm still keeping the majority since the inflation will impact me more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
