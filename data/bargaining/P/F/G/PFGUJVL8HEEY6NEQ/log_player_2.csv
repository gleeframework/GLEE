"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, so I'm proposing a counter-offer that's still beneficial to us both.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favors her. It makes sense to reject it and signal that a more balanced split is necessary.
* **Counter-offer:** Offering Alice slightly more than she would get in the next round if she rejects (600,000 * 0.9 = 540,000) makes it more likely she'll accept. 
* **Time sensitivity:** Delaying an agreement hurts both players due to inflation, but it hurts Alice more. This offer capitalizes on that urgency while still securing a reasonable amount for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unfavorable:** While Alice's offer is moving closer to the middle ground, it's still tilted in her favor. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The inflation is working more in Bob's favor now. Alice's offer is only slightly better than her potential gain in the next round (580,000 * 0.9 = 522,000), so she's likely feeling the pressure to make a deal.
* **Opportunity for Improvement:** By rejecting this offer, Bob signals that he's aiming for a more balanced split and is willing to risk another round to get it."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 470000, ""alice_gain"": 530000, ""message"": ""Time is running out! This is a very fair offer, let's close the deal and avoid further losses.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Bob is proposing a split closer to the middle ground, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Time Pressure Emphasis:**  The message explicitly highlights the time pressure and frames the offer as a way to ""avoid further losses"" for both parties.
* **Sweet Spot:** This offer aims to hit a sweet spot:
    * It's significantly better for Bob than accepting Alice's previous offer (420,000).
    * It's slightly better for Alice than her potential gain in the next round (530,000 vs. 580,000 * 0.9 = 522,000), making it appealing for her to accept.
    * The difference between their gains is now small enough that it might be perceived as fair and encourage a swift agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, but I still want a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **The Tipping Point:** While not ideal, Alice's offer is now within a reasonable range. The inflation is significantly impacting both players, and the potential gains from further negotiation are shrinking.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk. If Alice doesn't drastically change her stance in the next round, Bob might end up with even less. It's unlikely that squeezing out another few percentage points is worth the risk at this stage.
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting shows a willingness to compromise and ends the game, securing a decent amount for Bob despite the initial disadvantage. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing more to inflation."
