"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept a fair division. This opening offer allows room for negotiation while also setting a foundation for further discussion. Let's see how Bob responds!\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. Will he accept or proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the split is slightly more even than my initial proposal, I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially considering the impact of inflation on the money's value. By rejecting this offer, I'll have the opportunity to make a new proposal in the next round and potentially reach a more favorable agreement.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I've proposed a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor, with a message suggesting that we meet in the middle. This offer is more generous than my initial proposal and takes into account the effects of inflation. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. Will he accept or proceed to the next round?"
