Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 20-80 split, and I'm worried that the inflation will continue to erode the value of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."

I'm not happy with the 10-90 split, and I'm getting worried that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal, but I'm not sure if I can get a good one at this point."
