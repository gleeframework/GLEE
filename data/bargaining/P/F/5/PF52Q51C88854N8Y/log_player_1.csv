Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted by the offer before inflation kicks in.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is extremely unfair. Even though the money is worth less for me now, I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still keeping a majority for myself.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing, especially as the money is now worth less for me with each passing round. Let's see if he'll take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still extremely unfair. While the money is worth less for me now, I'm not willing to accept such a small share.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round, even if the money continues to lose value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share again, hoping this will be more tempting with the continued inflation. I need to strike a balance between securing a reasonable share and avoiding a stalemate.  Let's see if this offer works!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is better than the previous round, it's still a far cry from what I deserve.  I'm holding out for a more equitable split.  Inflation is a factor, but I believe I can get a better deal with a few more rounds to go!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This is getting intense! I'm offering Bob a generous 30% share, which is more than double what he offered me last round. The inflation is biting into my gains, but I believe this offer is fair enough to tempt Bob into accepting.  Let's see if he'll finally take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too unfair.  The inflation is definitely starting to hurt, but I'm not going to give in to his demands just yet.  I'm hoping that in the next few rounds, he'll realize that he needs to compromise for us to both get anything at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share again, aiming for a 60/40 split.  We are running out of time, and I need to secure a deal soon.  This offer is pushing the limits of what I'm willing to give up, but I'm hoping it will be enough to entice Bob."
