"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take 60%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair at this stage of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'll give you a chance to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the offer is less favorable to me than it initially seems. The $2000 I would get is worth 5% less than the $4000 I could have gotten in the first round, and the $8000 Bob gets is worth 20% less than the $4000 I initially offered him.

However, I don't want to give up yet. I'll try to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not accepting this offer. I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need a better deal. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me at a 50-50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I need to protect my interests. This is my best offer so far. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to squeeze out a better deal for myself, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on me!

Considering the significant drop in value of the money, Bob's offer seems more reasonable than it initially appears. However, I still need to be cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I need a bit more, considering the inflation. Can you meet me at 5000-5000?""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a 50-50 split, which seems more reasonable given the current state of the game."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to protect my interests. This is my best offer so far. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 52-48 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers. I'm trying to squeeze out a better deal for myself before the game ends."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is getting intense!

Considering the severe inflation, I'll have to be very aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you at a 50-50 split, but this is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll take what I can get at the end of the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is the fairest possible deal considering the current state of the game. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to take what's left if he doesn't."
