"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. I believe this is fair considering the potential for inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a more fair and balanced proposition. It allows for some room for negotiation, considering the potential for inflation, without being overly aggressive. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
