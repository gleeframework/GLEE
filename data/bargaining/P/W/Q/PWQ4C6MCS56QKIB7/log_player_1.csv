"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm taking a large portion for myself, but leaving Bob with a little something. I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept this in the first round, since the money will be worth less in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take some money, the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. I believe I can still get a better deal if I wait and propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still ensuring a significant amount for myself. The inflation has made my potential earnings much lower, so I'm aiming for a quick agreement to minimize further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has significantly impacted my potential earnings, I'm accepting this offer. Bob's proposal is significantly higher than my last offer, and I can't afford to keep rejecting and risk a lower offer in the next round. I'm taking what I can get at this point."
