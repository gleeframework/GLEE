Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd rather take a bigger share now, before inflation eats away more of the value. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The trend is in my favor.  While my buying power decreases with each round, Bob's is plummeting far faster. He's getting increasingly desperate. While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm willing to hold out for a slightly better offer in the next round. Bob is likely to cave soon, as waiting is far more costly for him."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before the money is worth even less for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a strategic concession. While I'm still aiming higher than Bob's last offer,  it's a significant shift from my previous stance. This emphasizes the urgency of the situation, making it clear I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be endlessly strung along. The rapidly declining value of the money, particularly for Bob, makes this offer increasingly appealing."
