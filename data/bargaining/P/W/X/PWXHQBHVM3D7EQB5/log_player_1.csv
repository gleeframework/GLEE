"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm proposing that we divide the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, I'll get a significant chunk of the money, but still leave Bob with a substantial amount as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to lowball me or not, but I'm not ready to give up 70% of the remaining money yet. I'll reject this offer and see what he comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}

I'm proposing a more even split this time, but still trying to get a slight edge."
