"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively fair split considering we're starting with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting more aggressive!

Considering the significant drop in value due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. However, 75 is a relatively high share for me, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
