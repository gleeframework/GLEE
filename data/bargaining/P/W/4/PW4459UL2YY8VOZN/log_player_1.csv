"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, this means that Bob is offering a slightly higher percentage of the total amount. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn again. I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed towards me, but it's still a relatively fair split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect on Bob's gain being much stronger, I'll try to take advantage of this and get a better deal. Since Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation effect on Bob's gain being much stronger, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Since Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed towards me, but it's still a relatively fair split considering the inflation effect. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation effect on Bob's gain is getting stronger and stronger! With Bob's gain being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'll try to take advantage of this and get an even better deal. Since Bob's gain is still worth less than mine, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining money.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually a 52-48 split, which is quite close to the original 50-50 split. Considering the inflation effect, I'll decide to accept this offer.
