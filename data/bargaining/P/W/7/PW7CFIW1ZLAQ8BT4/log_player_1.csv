"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll take a closer look at Bob's offer.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share, considering I didn't accept his previous offer. I'll reject this one as well.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer from round 2 was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my offer to be more favorable to myself. I'll offer a 55/45 split.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a bigger bite out of Bob's share, but he's still offering a relatively small advantage to himself. I'll consider this offer, but I'm not ready to give up just yet.

I'll reject this offer.
