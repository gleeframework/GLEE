"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I think this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer seems fair at face value, Alice gets significantly more.  I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in later rounds, especially as the value of the money decreases faster for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is your best chance to get a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to negotiate, but your offer was too low. This offer considers the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but this offer is still tilted in her favor.  I'll hold out for a better deal, knowing the value decreases faster for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it before the money shrinks even more! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The value of the money is rapidly decreasing, and while not ideal, a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
