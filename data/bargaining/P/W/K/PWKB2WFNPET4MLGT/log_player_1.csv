"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. This way, we both get a decent amount of money right from the start, and we can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still holding out for more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 70 * 0.9 = 63
* Bob gain: 30 * 0.9 = 27

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's a bit better than the first one. I'll think about it for a moment...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, Bob! I'm taking a slightly bigger share this time!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 85% and reducing Bob's share to 15%. Let's see if this will convince him to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 75 * 0.7279 = 54.5935
* Bob gain: 25 * 0.7279 = 18.1975

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept this offer yet. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob! I'm taking the majority of the loot!""
}
```

I'm going for a bold move and proposing that I get 90% of the remaining money, leaving Bob with a relatively small share. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm running out of patience, Alice! This is my last decent offer. Take it or we'll both get nothing! 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 65 * 0.5965 = 38.8065
* Bob gain: 35 * 0.5965 = 20.88025

This is a relatively close offer, and Bob is warning me that it's his last decent one. I'm not sure if I should take it, but I don't want to risk getting nothing...
