"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to keep 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. Since I have the first move and the inflation is unknown, I'm taking the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and the risk of losing money due to inflation is too high."
