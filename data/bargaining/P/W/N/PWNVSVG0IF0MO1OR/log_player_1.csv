"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking almost all the money in the first round, leaving Bob with a tiny portion.  Since I don't know how the inflation affects him, I'm trying to maximize my share before it starts to decrease.  
Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it hurts to get only $1, the inflation makes it clear that any further rounds will only make my share even smaller.  I'll take what I can get and accept this offer."
