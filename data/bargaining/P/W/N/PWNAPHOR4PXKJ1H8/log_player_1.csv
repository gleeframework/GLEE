"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to take 9000$ and leave 1000$ for Bob. This is a fair starting point, considering Bob's money will depreciate more quickly than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my previous proposal. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a drastic reduction in my share. I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 7000, but still offering Bob a fair amount.  I hope this will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer is lower than what I'd like, it's getting closer to 50/50, which is a fair outcome given the inflation rate.  I'll accept this offer to avoid further risk."
