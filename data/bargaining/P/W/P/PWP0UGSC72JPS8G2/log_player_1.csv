"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars, and Bob will get 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 dollars is worth 0.95 * 70 = 66.5 dollars, and Bob's gain of 60 dollars is worth 0.8 * 30 = 24 dollars.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 24 dollars in his currency. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
