"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see if I can get a better deal. The inflation difference is significant, and I might be able to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but with inflation, I need a larger share to compensate. Let's work towards a win-win."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increased inflation impact on you, I'll take a bit less than before, but still need a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still like a larger share, the inflation is hitting me hard. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and Alice is also willing to take a slightly smaller share to accommodate the inflation.  It's a compromise that works in both our favor."
