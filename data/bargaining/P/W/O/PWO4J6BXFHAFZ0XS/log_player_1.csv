"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a warning to Bob to think carefully before accepting or rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it right down the middle. No more games, just a clean break. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to split it down the middle, especially since the money is worth less for Bob than for me due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal because of inflation. I want more!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again! Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, trying to stay ahead of the inflation curve."
