"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiation""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, I'd be getting $300,000 in today's value, but it's actually equivalent to $300,000 / 0.95 = $315,789 in the first round's value.

As for Bob's gain, he's getting $700,000, which is worth $700,000 / 0.95 = $736,842 in the first round's value.

Considering the significant difference in our gains, I'll reject this offer. I'd like to propose a new division.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a good deal for me, I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still willing to give him $400,000."
