"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm offering Bob a small amount to hopefully make him think it's better than getting nothing if we don't come to an agreement.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though I get a decent amount, I think I can do better.  It's my turn to make an offer next, and I'll try to get a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering a slightly more even split this time, hoping to make it more appealing to Bob.  We're running out of time, so I need to find a balance between getting a good amount for myself and convincing Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split,  I'm worried that if I reject this offer, inflation will eat away at the remaining value too quickly and I might end up with nothing. This offer gives me a decent amount, and it's better to take it than risk getting nothing."
