Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
 
 I'll start by offering Bob a small portion of the money, hoping to secure a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair and avoids the risk of getting nothing due to inflation."
