Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, inflation is on my side 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, using inflation to her advantage. While the offer is getting worse, I need to present a stronger stance before my position erodes further.  It's a risk, but waiting might force her to offer something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This is the best offer you'll get, given the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I am mirroring Alice's offer from Round 3. This sends a message that I'm serious about not accepting a worse deal, and that further delay only hurts us both. It's a gamble, but I need to push back before inflation makes any reasonable offer unattractive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Each round is costing you dearly, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While 380,000 is significantly less than what I aimed for initially, rejecting this offer means risking even further losses due to inflation. Alice is unlikely to offer a better deal, knowing that time is on her side. Accepting now secures a less than ideal, but still acceptable amount, before inflation erodes it further."
