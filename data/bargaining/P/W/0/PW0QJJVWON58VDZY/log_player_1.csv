I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This seems fair as I am the one proposing the split in the first round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split in my favor. While Bob's offer was incredibly unfair, I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split, still in my favor, but recognizing the increasing pressure of inflation.  I need to secure a decent amount to make this worth it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. The inflation is really hurting my gains, and getting nothing is a real possibility. While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting a 30/70 split is better than risking getting nothing at all."
